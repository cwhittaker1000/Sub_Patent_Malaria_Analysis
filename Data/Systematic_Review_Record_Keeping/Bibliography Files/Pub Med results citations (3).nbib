TI  - Temporal changes in Plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial drug sensitivity in vitro
      and resistance-associated genetic mutations in isolates from Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 37

AB  - BACKGROUND: In northern Papua New Guinea (PNG), most Plasmodium falciparum
      isolates proved resistant to chloroquine (CQ) in vitro between 2005 and 2007, and
      there was near-fixation of pfcrt K76T, pfdhfr C59R/S108N and pfmdr1 N86Y. To
      determine whether the subsequent introduction of artemisinin combination therapy 
      (ACT) and reduced CQ-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pressure had attenuated parasite 
      drug susceptibility and resistance-associated mutations, these parameters were
      re-assessed between 2011 and 2013. METHODS: A validated fluorescence-based assay 
      was used to assess growth inhibition of 52 P. falciparum isolates from children
      in a clinical trial in Madang Province. Responses to CQ, lumefantrine,
      piperaquine, naphthoquine, pyronaridine, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin,
      artemether were assessed. Molecular resistance markers were detected using a
      multiplex PCR ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere assay. RESULTS:
      CQ resistance (in vitro concentration required for 50% parasite growth inhibition
      (IC(5)(0)) >100 nM) was present in 19% of isolates. All piperaquine and
      naphthoquine IC(5)(0)s were <100 nM and those for lumefantrine, pyronaridine and 
      the artemisinin derivatives were in low nM ranges. Factor analysis of IC(5)(0)s
      showed three groupings (lumefantrine; CQ, piperaquine, naphthoquine;
      pyronaridine, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate). Most isolates (96%)
      were monoclonal pfcrt K76T (SVMNT) mutants and most (86%) contained pfmdr1 N86Y
      (YYSND). No wild-type pfdhfr was found but most isolates contained wild-type
      (SAKAA) pfdhps. Compared with 2005-2007, the geometric mean (95% CI) CQ IC(5)(0) 
      was lower (87 (71-107) vs 167 (141-197) nM) and there had been no change in the
      prevalence of pfcrt K76T or pfmdr1 mutations. There were fewer isolates of the
      pfdhps (SAKAA) wild-type (60 vs 100%) and pfdhfr mutations persisted.
      CONCLUSIONS: Reflecting less drug pressure, in vitro CQ sensitivity appears to be
      improving in Madang Province despite continued near-fixation of pfcrt K76T and
      pfmdr1 mutations. Temporal changes in IC(5)(0)s for other anti-malarial drugs
      were inconsistent but susceptibility was preserved. Retention or increases in
      pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations reflect continued use of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
      in the study area including through paediatric intermittent preventive treatment.
      The susceptibility of local isolates to lumefantrine may be unrelated to those of
      other ACT partner drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Evaluation of non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification by loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (NINA-LAMP) for the diagnosis of malaria in Northwest
      Ethiopia.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0559-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan African
      countries including Ethiopia. Early and accurate diagnosis followed by prompt and
      effective treatment is among the various tools available for prevention, control 
      and elimination of malaria. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of
      non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification loop-mediated isothermal
      amplification (NINA-LAMP) compared to standard thick and thin film microscopy and
      nested PCR as gold standard for the sensitive diagnosis of malaria in Northwest
      Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in North Gondar,
      Ethiopia from March to July 2014. Eighty-two blood samples were collected from
      malaria suspected patients visiting Kola Diba Health Centre and analysed for
      Plasmodium parasites by microscopy, NINA-LAMP and nested PCR. The NINA-LAMP
      method was performed using the Loopamp Malaria Pan/Pf detection kits for
      detecting DNA of the genus Plasmodium and more specifically Plasmodium falciparum
      using an electricity-free heater. Diagnostic accuracy outcome measures
      (analytical sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Kappa scores) of
      NINA-LAMP and microscopy were compared to nested PCR. RESULTS: A total of 82
      samples were tested in the primary analysis. Using nested PCR as reference, the
      sensitivity and specificity of the primary NINA-LAMP assay were 96.8% (95%
      confidence interval (CI), 83.2% - 99.5%) and 84.3% (95% CI, 71.4% - 92.9%),
      respectively for detection of Plasmodium genus, and 100% (95% CI, 75.1% - 100%)
      and 81.2% (95% CI, 69.9% - 89.6%), respectively for detection of P. falciparum
      parasite. Microscopy demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 93.6% (95% CI,
      78.5% - 99.0%) and 98.0% (95% CI, 89.5% - 99.7%), respectively for the detection 
      of Plasmodium parasites. Post-hoc repeat NINA-LAMP analysis showed improvement in
      diagnostic accuracy, which was comparable to nested PCR performance and superior 
      to microscopy for detection at both the Plasmodium genus level and P. falciparum 
      parasites. CONCLUSION: NINA-LAMP is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of malaria
      and detection of Plasmodium parasite infection at both the genus and species
      level when compared to nested PCR. NINA-LAMP is more sensitive than microscopy
      for the detection of P. falciparum and differentiation from non-falciparum
      species and may be a critical diagnostic modality in efforts to eradicate malaria
      from areas of low endemicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of acute malaria in non-endemic countries is still
      carried out largely by microscopic examination of thick and thin smears or rapid 
      diagnostic tests. Low-density infections might be missed, however, but the more
      sensitive PCR is more expensive, complex and requires considerable more time.
      METHOD: We examined the suitability of a new loop-mediated isothermal
      DNA-amplification kit (LAMP) for malaria diagnosis in febrile returning
      travellers in comparison to qPCR and microscopic examination in a prospective
      study in a non-endemic setting at the Swiss TPH. RESULTS: Among 205 complete
      datasets, 43 samples were positive for malaria by microscopy, with Plasmodium
      falciparum (35 cases) being the most frequent species. All these samples were
      positive by both LAMP and qPCR, too. An additional 4 samples negative by
      microscopy were positive by both LAMP and qPCR. Three of these samples were
      follow-up samples taken after start of treatment in patients originally
      identified as positive by microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The LAMP performed exactly as 
      did the qPCR and is a very valuable diagnostic alternative with a potential of
      being used also in endemic settings.

TI  - Prevalence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in Puerto Lempira, Honduras.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s12936-014-0537-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the deletion of the histidine-rich
      protein 2 (PfHRP2) gene (pfhrp2) in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum,
      which could result in false negative test results when PfHRP2-based rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used for malaria diagnosis. Although primary
      diagnosis of malaria in Honduras is determined based on microscopy, RDTs may be
      useful in remote areas. In this study, it was investigated whether there are
      deletions of the pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and their respective flanking genes in 68 P.
      falciparum parasite isolates collected from the city of Puerto Lempira, Honduras.
      In addition, further investigation considered the possible correlation between
      parasite population structure and the distribution of these gene deletions by
      genotyping seven neutral microsatellites. METHODS: Sixty-eight samples used in
      this study, which were obtained from a previous chloroquine efficacy study, were 
      utilized in the analysis. All samples were genotyped for pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and
      flanking genes by PCR. The samples were then genotyped for seven neutral
      microsatellites in order to determine the parasite population structure in Puerto
      Lempira at the time of sample collection. RESULTS: It was found that all samples 
      were positive for pfhrp2 and its flanking genes on chromosome 8. However, only
      50% of the samples were positive for pfhrp3 and its neighboring genes while the
      rest were either pfhrp3-negative only or had deleted a combination of pfhrp3 and 
      its neighbouring genes on chromosome 13. Population structure analysis predicted 
      that there are at least two distinct parasite population clusters in this sample 
      population. It was also determined that a greater proportion of parasites with
      pfhrp3-(and flanking gene) deletions belonged to one cluster compared to the
      other. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the P. falciparum parasite
      population in the municipality of Puerto Lempira maintains the pfhrp2 gene and
      that PfHRP2-based RDTs could be considered for use in this region; however
      continued monitoring of parasite population will be useful to detect any
      parasites with deletions of pfhrp2.

TI  - Improving statistical inference on pathogen densities estimated by quantitative
      molecular methods: malaria gametocytaemia as a case study.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s12859-014-0402-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative molecular methods (QMMs) such as quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and
      quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) are
      increasingly used to estimate pathogen density in a variety of clinical and
      epidemiological contexts. These methods are often classified as
      semi-quantitative, yet estimates of reliability or sensitivity are seldom
      reported. Here, a statistical framework is developed for assessing the
      reliability (uncertainty) of pathogen densities estimated using QMMs and the
      associated diagnostic sensitivity. The method is illustrated with quantification 
      of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytaemia by QT-NASBA. RESULTS: The reliability of 
      pathogen (e.g. gametocyte) densities, and the accompanying diagnostic
      sensitivity, estimated by two contrasting statistical calibration techniques, are
      compared; a traditional method and a mixed model Bayesian approach. The latter
      accounts for statistical dependence of QMM assays run under identical laboratory 
      protocols and permits structural modelling of experimental measurements, allowing
      precision to vary with pathogen density. Traditional calibration cannot account
      for inter-assay variability arising from imperfect QMMs and generates estimates
      of pathogen density that have poor reliability, are variable among assays and
      inaccurately reflect diagnostic sensitivity. The Bayesian mixed model approach
      assimilates information from replica QMM assays, improving reliability and
      inter-assay homogeneity, providing an accurate appraisal of quantitative and
      diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian mixed model statistical calibration
      supersedes traditional techniques in the context of QMM-derived estimates of
      pathogen density, offering the potential to improve substantially the depth and
      quality of clinical and epidemiological inference for a wide variety of
      pathogens.

TI  - Characterization of Plasmodium ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western
      Kenya utilizing a novel species-specific real-time PCR assay.
PG  - e0003469
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003469 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is comprised of two genetically distinct subspecies,
      P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Although P. ovale subspecies are similar
      based on morphology and geographical distribution, allelic differences indicate
      that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are genetically divergent.
      Additionally, potential clinical and latency duration differences between P.
      ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri demonstrate the need for investigation into 
      the contribution of this neglected malaria parasite to the global malaria burden.
      METHODS: In order to detect all P. ovale subspecies simultaneously, we developed 
      an inclusive P. ovale-specific real-time PCR assay based on conserved regions
      between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in the reticulocyte binding
      protein 2 (rbp2) gene. Additionally, we characterized the P. ovale subspecies
      prevalence from 22 asymptomatic malaria infections using multilocus genotyping to
      discriminate P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. RESULTS: Our P. ovale rbp2 
      qPCR assay validation experiments demonstrated a linear dynamic range from 6.25
      rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter to 100,000 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter and a
      limit of detection of 1.5 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter. Specificity experiments
      showed the ability of the rbp2 qPCR assay to detect low-levels of P. ovale in the
      presence of additional malaria parasite species, including P. falciparum, P.
      vivax, and P. malariae. We identified P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in 
      Western Kenya by DNA sequencing of the tryptophan-rich antigen gene, the small
      subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and the rbp2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel P. ovale
      rbp2 qPCR assay detects P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri simultaneously
      and can be utilized to characterize the prevalence, distribution, and burden of
      P. ovale in malaria endemic regions. Using multilocus genotyping, we also
      provided the first description of the prevalence of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale
      wallikeri in Western Kenya, a region holoendemic for malaria transmission.

TI  - Treatment of uncomplicated malaria with artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      is failing in Somalia: evidence from therapeutic efficacy studies and Pfdhfr and 
      Pfdhps mutant alleles.
PG  - 510-7
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) has been Somalia's
      national treatment policy since 2006. Routine monitoring of first-line malaria
      treatment is needed to ensure appropriate national malaria treatment policy and
      early detection of drug resistance. For this purpose, we conducted therapeutic
      efficacy studies of AS + SP for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Somalia
      in 2011. METHODS: Studies were conducted in three sentinel sites. Eligible
      patients were evaluated for clinical and parasitological outcomes according to
      the WHO standard protocol. Molecular surveillance was conducted on resistance
      conferring mutations in the P.falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dfhr) and
      dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes. RESULTS: The proportion of PCR-corrected
      treatment failures was high in Jamame (22%, 95% CI: 13.7-32.8%) and low (<5%) in 
      Janale and Jowhar. All patients cleared parasites by day 3. Molecular markers
      associated with SP resistance were detected in all three sites. Treatment failure
      was associated with the presence of the double mutant dhps A437G/K540E (OR =
      22.4, 95% CI: 5.1-98.1), quadruple mutant dhfr N51I/S108N+dhps A437G/K540E (OR = 
      5.5, 95% CI: 2.3-13.6), quintuple mutant dhfr N51I/C59R/S108N+dhps A437G/K540E
      (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.4-8.8) and younger age (OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.96).
      CONCLUSIONS: The high treatment failure rate observed in Jamame, together with
      the presence of molecular mutations associated with SP resistance, indicates P.
      falciparum resistance to SP. In Jowhar, high treatment failure rates were absent 
      despite the presence of molecular mutations; signs of resistance in vivo may have
      been masked by the stronger immunity of the older study population. The study
      underscores the need to update Somalia's national malaria treatment policy.

TI  - Full-length sequence analysis of chloroquine resistance transporter gene in
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Sabah, Malaysia.
PG  - 935846
LID - 10.1155/2014/935846 [doi]
AB  - Chloroquine resistance (CQR) in falciparum malaria was identified to be
      associated with several mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter gene 
      (pfcrt) that encodes the transmembrane transporter in digestive vacuole membrane 
      of the parasite. This study aimed to investigate the point mutations across the
      full-length pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum isolates in Sabah, Malaysia. A total
      of 31 P. falciparum positive samples collected from Keningau, Kota Kinabalu, and 
      Kudat, Sabah, were analyzed. pfcrt was PCR amplified and cloned prior to sequence
      analysis. This study showed that all the previously described 10 point mutations 
      associated with CQR at codons 72, 74, 75, 76, 97, 220, 271, 326, 356, and 371
      were found with different prevalence. Besides, two novel point mutations, I166V
      and H273N, were identified with 22.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Three haplotypes, 
      namely, CVMNK (29%), CVIET (3.2%), and SVMNT (67.7%), were identified. High
      prevalence of SVMNT among P. falciparum isolates from Sabah showed that these
      isolates are closer to the P. falciparum isolates from Papua New Guinea rather
      than to the more proximal Southeast Asian CVIET haplotype. Full-length analysis
      of pfcrt showed that chloroquine resistant P. falciparum in Sabah is still
      prevalent despite the withdrawal of chloroquine usage since 1979.

TI  - Host genetic variations in glutathione-S-transferases, superoxide dismutases and 
      catalase genes influence susceptibility to malaria infection in an Indian
      population.
PG  - 1155-68
LID - 10.1007/s00438-014-0984-4 [doi]
AB  - Antioxidant enzymes can contribute to disease susceptibility or determine
      response to therapy in individuals with malaria. Genetic variations due to
      polymorphisms in host genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione
      S-transferases-theta, mu, pi (GSTT, GSTM, GSTP), superoxide dismutases (SOD) and 
      catalase (CAT), may therefore, influence inter-individual response to malaria
      pathology and propensity of infection caused by Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Therefore, using polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing, 
      we investigated the association of deletions of GSTT1 and GSTM1, single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GSTP1 (rs1695), SOD1 (rs2234694), SOD2
      (rs4880, rs1141718), SOD3 (rs2536512) and CAT (rs1001179) in individuals infected
      with Pf (n = 100) and Pv (n = 100) against healthy controls (n = 150). Our data
      suggest a significant role for GSTM1 deletions in complicated Pv (p = 0.0007)
      malaria with ODDs ratio 3.8 [with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.9-7.4]. The
      results also indicated that polymorphisms present in GSTP1, SOD1 and CAT genes
      may be associated with malaria susceptibility (p < 0.05), whereas SOD3
      polymorphism may play a role in malarial resistance (p < 0.05). In addition, we
      observed significant SNP-SNP interactions with synergistic genetic effects in
      SOD2, SOD3 and CAT genes for Pv and in SOD2 and SOD3 genes for Pf. In conclusion,
      our results provide convincing evidence for a relationship between polymorphisms 
      in host antioxidant enzymes and susceptibility to malaria infection.

TI  - Evaluation of the loop mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) kit for
      malaria diagnosis in P. vivax endemic settings of Colombia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most commonly used malaria diagnostic tests, including microscopy and
      antigen-detecting rapid tests, cannot reliably detect low-density infections
      which are frequent in low transmission settings. Molecular methods such as
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive but remain too laborious for
      field deployment. In this study, the applicability of a malaria diagnosis kit
      based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mLAMP) was assessed in malaria
      endemic areas of Colombia with Plasmodium vivax predominance.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, a passive case detection (PCD) study on
      278 febrile patients recruited in Tierralta (department of Cordoba) was conducted
      to assess the diagnostic performance of the mLAMP method. Second, an active case 
      detection (ACD) study on 980 volunteers was conducted in 10 sentinel sites with
      different epidemiological profiles. Whole blood samples were processed for
      microscopic and mLAMP diagnosis. Additionally RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR were used 
      as reference tests. In the PCD study, P. falciparum accounted for 23.9% and P.
      vivax for 76.1% of the infections and no cases of mixed-infections were
      identified. Microscopy sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax were 100% and
      86.1%, respectively. mLAMP sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax was 100%
      and 91.4%, respectively. In the ACD study, mLAMP detected 65 times more cases
      than microscopy. A high proportion (98.0%) of the infections detected by mLAMP
      was from volunteers without symptoms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: mLAMP sensitivity
      and specificity were comparable to RT-PCR. LAMP was significantly superior to
      microscopy and in P. vivax low-endemicity settings and under minimum
      infrastructure conditions, it displayed sensitivity and specificity similar to
      that of single-well RT-PCR for detection of both P. falciparum and P. vivax
      infections. Here, the dramatically increased detection of asymptomatic malaria
      infections by mLAMP demonstrates the usefulness of this new tool for diagnosis,
      surveillance, and screening in elimination strategies.

TI  - Systematic review of sub-microscopic P. vivax infections: prevalence and
      determining factors.
PG  - e3413
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003413 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-microscopic (SM) Plasmodium infections represent transmission
      reservoirs that could jeopardise malaria elimination goals. A better
      understanding of the epidemiology of these infections and factors contributing to
      their occurrence will inform effective elimination strategies. While the
      epidemiology of SM P. falciparum infections has been documented, that of SM P.
      vivax infections has not been summarised. The objective of this study is to
      address this deficiency. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic search of
      PubMed was conducted, and results of both light microscopy (LM) and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests for P. vivax from 44 cross-sectional 
      surveys or screening studies of clinical malaria suspects were analysed. Analysis
      revealed that SM P. vivax is prevalent across different geographic areas with
      varying transmission intensities. On average, the prevalence of SM P. vivax in
      cross-sectional surveys was 10.9%, constituting 67.0% of all P. vivax infections 
      detected by PCR. The relative proportion of SM P. vivax is significantly higher
      than that of the sympatric P. falciparum in these settings. A positive
      relationship exists between PCR and LM P. vivax prevalence, while there is a
      negative relationship between the proportion of SM P. vivax and the LM prevalence
      for P. vivax. Amongst clinical malaria suspects, however, SM P. vivax was not
      identified. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SM P. vivax is prevalent across different
      geographic areas, particularly areas with relatively low transmission intensity. 
      Diagnostic tools with sensitivity greater than that of LM are required for
      detecting these infection reservoirs. In contrast, SM P. vivax is not prevalent
      in clinical malaria suspects, supporting the recommended use of quality LM and
      rapid diagnostic tests in clinical case management. These findings enable malaria
      control and elimination programs to estimate the prevalence and proportion of SM 
      P. vivax infections in their settings, and develop appropriate elimination
      strategies to tackle SM P. vivax to interrupt transmission.

TI  - Evaluating controlled human malaria infection in Kenyan adults with varying
      degrees of prior exposure to Plasmodium falciparum using sporozoites administered
      by intramuscular injection.
PG  - 686
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00686 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies are a vital tool to
      accelerate vaccine and drug development. As CHMI trials are performed in a
      controlled environment, they allow unprecedented, detailed evaluation of parasite
      growth dynamics (PGD) and immunological responses. However, CHMI studies have not
      been routinely performed in malaria-endemic countries or used to investigate
      mechanisms of naturally-acquired immunity (NAI) to Plasmodium falciparum.
      METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized CHMI pilot-study using aseptic,
      cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge) to evaluate safety,
      infectivity and PGD in Kenyan adults with low to moderate prior exposure to P.
      falciparum (Pan African Clinical Trial Registry: PACTR20121100033272). RESULTS:
      All participants developed blood-stage infection confirmed by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However one volunteer (110) remained
      asymptomatic and blood-film negative until day 21 post-injection of PfSPZ
      Challenge. This volunteer had a reduced parasite multiplication rate (PMR) (1.3) 
      in comparison to the other 27 volunteers (median 11.1). A significant correlation
      was seen between PMR and screening anti-schizont Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
      Assays (ELISA) OD (p = 0.044, R = -0.384) but not when volunteer 110 was excluded
      from the analysis (p = 0.112, R = -0.313). CONCLUSIONS: PfSPZ Challenge is safe
      and infectious in malaria-endemic populations and could be used to assess the
      efficacy of malaria vaccines and drugs in African populations. Whilst our
      findings are limited by sample size, our pilot study has demonstrated for the
      first time that NAI may impact on PMR post-CHMI in a detectable fashion, an
      important finding that should be evaluated in further CHMI studies.

LID - 10.1111/mmi.12922 [doi]
AB  - Accurate regulation of microfilament dynamics is central to cell growth, motility
      and response to environmental stimuli. Stabilizing and depolymerizing proteins
      control the steady-state levels of filamentous (F-) actin. Capping protein (CP)
      binds to free barbed ends, thereby arresting microfilament growth and restraining
      elongation to remaining free barbed ends. In all CPs characterized to date, alpha
      and beta subunits form the active heterodimer. Here, we show in a eukaryotic
      parasitic cell that the two CP subunits can be functionally separated. Unlike the
      beta subunit, the CP alpha subunit of the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium is
      refractory to targeted gene deletion during blood infection in the mammalian
      host. Combinatorial complementation of Plasmodium berghei CP genes with the
      orthologs from Plasmodium falciparum verified distinct activities of CP alpha and
      CP alpha/beta during parasite life cycle progression. Recombinant Plasmodium CP
      alpha could be produced in Escherichia coli in the absence of the beta subunit
      and the protein displayed F-actin capping activity. Thus, the functional
      separation of two CP subunits in a parasitic eukaryotic cell and the F-actin
      capping activity of CP alpha expand the repertoire of microfilament regulatory
      mechanisms assigned to CPs.

TI  - The A581G Mutation in the Gene Encoding Plasmodium falciparum Dihydropteroate
      Synthetase Reduces the Effectiveness of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine Preventive
      Therapy in Malawian Pregnant Women.
PG  - 1997-2005
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu836 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The A581 G: mutation in the gene encoding Plasmodium falciparum
      dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), in combination with the quintuple mutant
      involving mutations in both dhps and the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase
      (dhfr), the so-called sextuple mutant, has been associated with increased
      placental inflammation and decreased infant birth weight among women receiving
      intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) during
      pregnancy. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2011, delivering women without human
      immunodeficiency virus infection were enrolled in an observational study of
      IPTp-SP effectiveness in Malawi. Parasites were detected by polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR); positive samples were sequenced to genotype the dhfr and dhps
      loci. The presence of K540 E: in dhps was used as a marker for the quintuple
      mutant. RESULTS: Samples from 1809 women were analyzed by PCR; 220 (12%) were
      positive for P. falciparum. A total of 202 specimens were genotyped at codon 581 
      of dhps; 17 (8.4%) harbored the sextuple mutant. The sextuple mutant was
      associated with higher risks of patent infection in peripheral blood (adjusted
      prevalence ratio [aPR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-4.18) and
      placental blood (aPR 3.28; 95% CI, 1.88-5.78) and higher parasite densities.
      Recent SP use was not associated with increased parasite densities or placental
      pathology overall and among women with parasites carrying dhps A581 G: .
      CONCLUSIONS: IPTp-SP failed to inhibit parasite growth but did not exacerbate
      pathology among women infected with sextuple-mutant parasites. New interventions 
      to prevent malaria during pregnancy are needed urgently.

TI  - Antibiotics in ingested human blood affect the mosquito microbiota and capacity
      to transmit malaria.
PG  - 5921
LID - 10.1038/ncomms6921 [doi]
AB  - Malaria reduction is most efficiently achieved by vector control whereby human
      populations at high risk of contracting and transmitting the disease are
      protected from mosquito bites. Here, we identify the presence of antibiotics in
      the blood of malaria-infected people as a new risk of increasing disease
      transmission. We show that antibiotics in ingested blood enhance the
      susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes to malaria infection by disturbing
      their gut microbiota. This effect is confirmed in a semi-natural setting by
      feeding mosquitoes with blood of children naturally infected with Plasmodium
      falciparum. Antibiotic exposure additionally increases mosquito survival and
      fecundity, which are known to augment vectorial capacity. These findings suggest 
      that malaria transmission may be exacerbated in areas of high antibiotic usage,
      and that regions targeted by mass drug administration programs against
      communicable diseases may necessitate increased vector control.

TI  - Malaria PCR detection in Cambodian low-transmission settings: dried blood spots
      versus venous blood samples.
PG  - 573-7
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0614 [doi]
AB  - In the context of malaria elimination, novel strategies for detecting very low
      malaria parasite densities in asymptomatic individuals are needed. One of the
      major limitations of the malaria parasite detection methods is the volume of
      blood samples being analyzed. The objective of the study was to compare the
      diagnostic accuracy of a malaria polymerase chain reaction assay, from dried
      blood spots (DBS, 5 muL) and different volumes of venous blood (50 muL, 200 muL, 
      and 1 mL). The limit of detection of the polymerase chain reaction assay, using
      calibrated Plasmodium falciparum blood dilutions, showed that venous blood
      samples (50 muL, 200 muL, 1 mL) combined with Qiagen extraction methods gave a
      similar threshold of 100 parasites/mL, approximately 100-fold lower than 5 muL
      DBS/Instagene method. On a set of 521 field samples, collected in two different
      transmission areas in northern Cambodia, no significant difference in the
      proportion of parasite carriers, regardless of the methods used was found. The 5 
      muL DBS method missed 27% of the samples detected by the 1 mL venous blood
      method, but most of the missed parasites carriers were infected by Plasmodium
      vivax (84%). The remaining missed P. falciparum parasite carriers (N = 3) were
      only detected in high-transmission areas.

TI  - Toll-like receptor (TLR4) Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in relation to
      clinical falciparum malaria among Nigerian children: a multisite cross-sectional 
      immunogenetic study in Lagos.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/s41021-015-0002-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study determined the association of TLR4 Asp299Gly and
      Thr399Ile with uncomplicated and severe malaria among Nigerian children of
      similar ethnic background in Lagos. The association of these SNPs with high
      parasite density, malnutrition, hyperpyrexia and anaemia was also investigated.
      METHODS: Genomic DNA of the study participants was screened for the genotypes of 
      TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile by PCR-RFLP. Anthropometric measurement was
      performed on the Pf infected children stratified into asymptomatic malaria
      (control), uncomplicated and severe malaria (case). Parasites were detected by
      light microscopy and Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) of SNP genotypes was also
      determined. RESULTS: A total of 279 children comprising 182 children (62.1 %
      male; mean +/- SEM age, 57.3 +/- 1.7 months) with clinical falciparum malaria and
      97 children (55.7 % male; mean +/- SEM age, 55.6 +/- 2.5 years) with asymptomatic
      falciparum malaria were enrolled. All the genotypes of both TLR4 SNPs were found 
      in the study population with their minor alleles: 299Gly and 399Ile, found to be 
      17.6 % and 14.7 % in severe malaria children. Unlike in asymptomatic population, 
      the genotype distribution of TLR4 Asp299Gly SNP was not in HWE in the clinical
      malaria group but did not condition susceptibility. However, Asp299Gly and
      Thr399Ile polymorphisms were found to increase the risk of severe malaria 3-fold 
      and 8-fold respectively (P < 0.05). They also increased the risk of severe
      anaemia, high parasite density and severe malnutrition 3.8 -5.3-fold, 3.3 -
      4.4-fold and 4-fold respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings, we
      conclude that TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms may modulate
      susceptibility to severe malaria among Nigerian children of Yoruba ethnic
      background.

TI  - Asymptomatic falciparum malaria and genetic polymorphisms of Pfcrt K76T and
      Pfmdr1 N86Y among almajirai in northeast Nigeria.
PG  - 290-7
LID - 10.3855/jidc.6853 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malaria remains a public health challenge, especially in
      sub-Saharan Africa where asymptomatic malaria is not uncommon. In the present
      study, the prevalence of asymptomatic falciparum malaria was investigated in
      almajirai, and the genetic polymorphisms of chloroquine (CQ) resistance
      biomarkers were assessed. METHODOLOGY: A total of 440 apparently healthy
      almajirai between 3 and 12 years of age were randomly enrolled in Maiduguri,
      northeast Nigeria, between July and December 2010. Parasitemia and gametocytemia 
      were assessed by light microscopy, and polymorphisms of Pfcrt K76T and Pfmdr1
      N86Y were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction
      fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques. RESULTS: The mean age of the
      subjects was 8.3 +/- 4.5 years, with subjects </= 5 years accounting for 10.7%
      (47/440) of the population. Prevalence of asymptomatic falciparum parasitemia and
      gametocytemia were 12.7% (56/440) and 8.6% (38/440), respectively. Geometric mean
      parasite density (GMPD) was 240 (160-630) parasites/microL, while geometric mean 
      gametocyte density (GMGD) was 53 (24-96) gametocytes/microL. The GMPD was higher 
      among subjects </= 5 years of age (p = 0.027). Pfcrt 76T was detected in 5.4%
      (3/56) of the isolates, and no isolates harbored Pfmdr1 86Y mutant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study reveals asymptomatic falciparum malaria in almajirai and low levels of 
      Pfcrt 76T and Pfmdr1 86Y alleles. These findings could hinder malaria control
      measures, and hence almajirai should be incorporated into malaria control
      programs.

TI  - SD Bioline malaria antigen Pf (HRP-2/pLHD) for assessing efficacy of artemisinin 
      combination therapy against Plasmodium falciparum in pediatric patients in the
      Democratic Republic of the Congo.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin
      combination therapy (ACT) is a worrying development. It calls for close
      surveillance to monitor the efficacy of the drugs. The objectives of this study
      were to determine the performance of SD Bioline malaria AgPf(HRP-2/pLDH) 3 band
      Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) against Giemsa-stained blood smear and evaluate the
      suitability of this test in assessing the therapeutic efficacy of ACT in
      pediatric malaria patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
      METHODS: Five hundred and one patients with malaria symptoms were screened for P.
      falciparum in Kinshasa, DRC. Of the 166 patients who tested positive for P.
      falciparum at recruitment (day 0), 103 consented to participate in this study and
      were followed up and retested for P. falciparum on day 3, day 7, day 14, day 21
      and day 28. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the test were significantly
      high on day 0 and so were their positive and negative predictive values. Higher
      proportions of false positive cases were observed on the HRP-2 band irrespective 
      of patient parasite densities during the follow up but these were barely seen on 
      the pLDH band. Some patients turned positive during follow up but pLDH readings
      remained consistent with blood smear readings. CONCLUSION: SD Bioline malaria
      AgPf(HRP-2/pLDH) RDT demonstrated high performance in DRC. Thus, the test can be 
      employed to assess the efficacy of ACT in pediatric malaria patients and
      prioritize areas that require the deployment of advanced testing like polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR).

TI  - Artemisinin-naphthoquine versus artemether-lumefantrine for uncomplicated malaria
      in Papua New Guinean children: an open-label randomized trial.
PG  - e1001773
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) with broad efficacy are
      needed where multiple Plasmodium species are transmitted, especially in children,
      who bear the brunt of infection in endemic areas. In Papua New Guinea (PNG),
      artemether-lumefantrine is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria,
      but it has limited efficacy against P. vivax. Artemisinin-naphthoquine should
      have greater activity in vivax malaria because the elimination of naphthoquine is
      slower than that of lumefantrine. In this study, the efficacy, tolerability, and 
      safety of these ACTs were assessed in PNG children aged 0.5-5 y. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: An open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial of
      artemether-lumefantrine (six doses over 3 d) and artemisinin-naphthoquine (three 
      daily doses) was conducted between 28 March 2011 and 22 April 2013. Parasitologic
      outcomes were assessed without knowledge of treatment allocation. Primary
      endpoints were the 42-d P. falciparum PCR-corrected adequate clinical and
      parasitologic response (ACPR) and the P. vivax PCR-uncorrected 42-d ACPR.
      Non-inferiority and superiority designs were used for falciparum and vivax
      malaria, respectively. Because the artemisinin-naphthoquine regimen involved
      three doses rather than the manufacturer-specified single dose, the first 188
      children underwent detailed safety monitoring. Of 2,542 febrile children
      screened, 267 were randomized, and 186 with falciparum and 47 with vivax malaria 
      completed the 42-d follow-up. Both ACTs were safe and well tolerated. P.
      falciparum ACPRs were 97.8% and 100.0% in artemether-lumefantrine and
      artemisinin-naphthoquine-treated patients, respectively (difference 2.2% [95% CI 
      -3.0% to 8.4%] versus -5.0% non-inferiority margin, p = 0.24), and P. vivax ACPRs
      were 30.0% and 100.0%, respectively (difference 70.0% [95% CI 40.9%-87.2%],
      p<0.001). Limitations included the exclusion of 11% of randomized patients with
      sub-threshold parasitemias on confirmatory microscopy and direct observation of
      only morning artemether-lumefantrine dosing. CONCLUSIONS:
      Artemisinin-naphthoquine is non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine in PNG
      children with falciparum malaria but has greater efficacy against vivax malaria, 
      findings with implications in similar geo-epidemiologic settings within and
      beyond Oceania. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials

TI  - An imported case of severe falciparum malaria with prolonged hemolytic anemia
      clinically mimicking a coinfection with babesiosis.

AB  - While imported falciparum malaria has been increasingly reported in recent years 
      in Korea, clinicians have difficulties in making a clinical diagnosis as well as 
      in having accessibility to effective anti-malarial agents. Here we describe an
      unusual case of imported falciparum malaria with severe hemolytic anemia lasting 
      over 2 weeks, clinically mimicking a coinfection with babesiosis. A 48-year old
      Korean man was diagnosed with severe falciparum malaria in France after traveling
      to the Republic of Benin, West Africa. He received a 1-day course of intravenous 
      artesunate and a 7-day course of Malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) with supportive 
      hemodialysis. Coming back to Korea 5 days after discharge, he was readmitted due 
      to recurrent fever, and further treated with Malarone for 3 days. Both the
      peripheral blood smears and PCR test were positive for Plasmodium falciparum.
      However, he had prolonged severe hemolytic anemia (Hb 5.6 g/dl). Therefore, 10
      days after the hospitalization, Babesia was considered to be potentially
      coinfected. A 7-day course of Malarone and azithromycin was empirically started. 
      He became afebrile within 3 days of this babesiosis treatment, and hemolytic
      anemia profiles began to improve at the completion of the treatment. He has
      remained stable since his discharge. Unexpectedly, the PCR assays failed to
      detect DNA of Babesia spp. from blood. In addition, during the retrospective
      review of the case, the artesunate-induced delayed hemolytic anemia was
      considered as an alternative cause of the unexplained hemolytic anemia.

TI  - Congenital malaria in newborns selected for low birth-weight, anemia, and other
      possible symptoms in Maumere, Indonesia.
PG  - 639-44

AB  - Congenital malaria is assumed to be a risk factor for infant morbidity and
      mortality in endemic areas like Maumere, Indonesia. Infected infants are
      susceptible to its impact such as premature labor, low birth weight, anemia, and 
      other unspecified symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      prevalence of congenital malaria and the influence of mother-infant paired
      parasite densities on the clinical outcome of the newborns at TC Hillers
      Hospital, Maumere. An analytical cross sectional study was carried out in
      newborns which showed criteria associated with congenital malaria. A thick and
      thin blood smear confirmed by nested PCR was performed in both mothers and
      infants. The association of congenital malaria with the newborn's health status
      was then assessed. From 112 mother-infant pairs included in this study, 92 were
      evaluated further. Thirty-nine infants (42.4%) were found to be infected and half
      of them were asymptomatic. Infected newborns had a 4.7 times higher risk in
      developing anemia compared to uninfected newborns (95% CI, 1.3-17.1). The
      hemoglobin level, erythrocyte amount, and hematocrit level were affected by the
      infants' parasite densities (P<0.05). Focusing on newborns at risk of congenital 
      malaria, the prevalence is almost 3 times higher than in an unselected
      collective. Low birth weight, anemia, and pre-term birth were the most common
      features. Anemia seems to be significantly influenced by infant parasite
      densities but not by maternal parasitemia.

AB  - Genetic characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum may play a role in the treatment
      outcome of malaria infection. We have studied the association between diversity
      at the merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1), msp-2, and glutamate-rich protein
      (glurp) loci and the treatment outcome of uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      patients along the Thai-Myanmar border who were treated with artemisinin
      derivatives combination therapy. P. falciparum isolates were collected prior to
      treatment from 3 groups of patients; 50 cases of treatment failures, 50
      recrudescences, and 56 successful treatments. Genotyping of the 3 polymorphic
      markers was analyzed by nested PCR. The distribution of msp-1 alleles was
      significantly different among the 3 groups of patients but not the msp-2 and
      glurp alleles. The allelic frequencies of K1 and MAD20 alleles of msp1 gene were 
      higher while RO33 allele was significantly lower in the successful treatment
      group. Treatment failure samples had a higher median number of alleles as
      compared to the successful treatment group. Specific genotypes of msp-1, msp-2,
      and glurp were significantly associated with the treatment outcomes. Three
      allelic size variants were significantly higher among the isolates from the
      treatment failure groups, i.e., K1270-290, 3D7610-630, G650-690, while 2
      variants, K1150-170, and 3D7670-690 were significantly lower. In conclusion, the 
      present study reports the differences in multiplicity of infection and
      distribution of specific alleles of msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes in P.
      falciparum isolates obtained from treatment failure and successful treatment
      patients following artemisinin derivatives combination therapy.

TI  - Detection of point mutation in Plasmodium falciparum ATPase6 gene associated with
      artemisinin resistance from Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.
PG  - 282-5
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Resistance against partner drugs of artemisinin has been
      reported from different parts of India. The study aims to find out the single
      nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum ATPase6 gene associated with
      artemisinin resistance. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 141 patients
      with P. falciparum monoinfection in malaria endemic zones of Assam and Arunachal 
      Pradesh. A 645 bp portion of PfATPase6 gene was amplified and sequenced to
      determine the frequency of mutations associated with resistance to artemisinin.
      RESULTS: Mutations at codon S769N, which have been proposed to confer artemisinin
      resistance, were not detected in our study samples. Instead of that a novel
      non-synonymous mutation (C-T) at 1847 bp position resulting in serine to
      phenylalanine alteration at codon S616F was detected from the P. falciparum field
      isolates in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh, whereas no mutation was
      detected in any of the analyzed samples in Assam indicating that wild type
      PfATPase6 genotype was found circulating in this region. Overall, based on the
      mutational pattern, two haplotypes of PfATPase6 gene were observed during the
      study, the wild type and mutant S616F allele. The overall haplotype diversity
      (Hd) was found to be: 0.069 and nucleotide diversity (per site Pi): 0.00012.
      Highest haplotype diversity was recorded in Changlang district of Arunachal
      Pradesh having Hd value of 0.33333 along with single polymorphic site and
      nucleotide diversity (Pi): 0.00060. A pair-wise fixation index (FST) value of
      0.16667 indicates great genetic differentiation within the parasite population of
      Changlang district with the population of Karbi Anglong, Chirang, Tinsukia,
      Sivasagar, Jorhat, NC Hills, Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Dibrugarh districts of Assam
      and Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A better
      understanding of the distribution of antimalarial drug resistance with malaria
      parasite may provide insight into some of the epidemiological determinants of the
      increasing case burden.

TI  - Malaria detection using inertial microfluidics.
PG  - 1101-9
LID - 10.1039/c4lc01058b [doi]
AB  - Diagnosis of malaria at the early stage of infection is challenging due to the
      difficulty in detecting low abundance parasites from blood. Molecular methods
      such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) can be especially useful for
      detecting low parasitemia levels due to their high sensitivity and their ability 
      to recognize different malarial species and strains. Unfortunately, the accuracy 
      of qPCR-based malaria detection can be compromised by many factors, including the
      limited specificity of primers, presence of PCR inhibitors in blood serum and DNA
      contamination from nucleated blood cells. Here, we use a label-free,
      shear-modulated inertial microfluidic system to enrich malaria parasites from
      blood so as to facilitate a more reliable and specific PCR-based malaria
      detection. This technique capitalizes on cell focusing behaviors in high aspect
      ratio microchannels coupled with pinched flow dynamics to isolate ring-stage
      malaria parasites from lysed blood containing white blood cells (WBCs). In this
      high aspect ratio (ratio of the channel height to the width) platform, the high
      shear rate along the channel width causes the dispersed WBCs at the inlet to
      migrate and align into two streams near the channel sidewalls while the malaria
      parasites remain unfocused. Sensitive detection of parasites at spiked densities 
      ranging from 10(3) to 10(4)Plasmodium falciparum parasites per mL (~2-10 per muL)
      has been demonstrated; they have also been quantified in whole blood using qPCR. 
      This is approximately 100-fold more sensitive than the gold standard conventional
      microscopy analysis of thick blood smears. The simplicity of this device makes it
      ideal for integration with an automatic system for ultra-fast and accurate
      detection despite low levels of parasitemia. It can also help in malaria
      screening and elimination efforts.

      State (Central India).
PG  - e115266
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study on severe and complicated malaria was undertaken 
      in the tribal dominated area of Bastar division, Chhattisgarh (CG), Central
      India, with an objective to understand the clinical epidemiology of complicated
      malaria in patients attending at a referral hospital. METHODS: Blood smears,
      collected from the general medicine and pediatric wards of a government tertiary 
      health care facility located in Jagdalpur, CG, were microscopically examined for 
      malaria parasite from July 2010 to December 2013. The Plasmodium falciparum
      positive malaria cases who met enrollment criteria and provided written informed 
      consent were enrolled under different malaria categories following WHO
      guidelines. PCR was performed to reconfirm the presence of P.falciparum mono
      infection among enrolled cases. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
      analysis was done to identify different risk factors using STATA 11.0. RESULTS: A
      total of 40,924 cases were screened for malaria. The prevalence of malaria and
      P.falciparum associated complicated malaria (severe and cerebral both) in the
      hospital was 6% and 0.81%, respectively. P.falciparum malaria prevalence,
      severity and associated mortality in this region peaked at the age of > 4-5 years
      and declined with increasing age. P.falciparum malaria was significantly more
      prevalent in children than adults (P < 0.00001). Among adults, males had
      significantly more P.falciparum malaria than females (P < 0.00001). Case fatality
      rate due to cerebral malaria and severe malaria was, respectively, 32% and 9%
      among PCR confirmed mono P.falciparum cases. Coma was the only independent
      predictor of mortality in multivariate regression analysis. Mortality was
      significantly associated with multi-organ complication score (P = 0.0003).
      CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that the pattern of morbidity and mortality
      in this part of India is very different from earlier reported studies from India.
      We find that the peak morbidity and mortality in younger children regardless of
      seasonality. This suggests that this age group needs special care for control and
      clinical management.

      2014 outbreak.
PG  - 19-31
LID - 10.1089/vim.2014.0108 [doi]
AB  - Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus
      (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra 
      Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 
      suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients
      presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV
      immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile 
      illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill,
      which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were
      aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases 
      presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A
      seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus,
      chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase
      chain reaction-based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of
      prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of
      patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected 
      at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the
      KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola 
      virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed
      outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible
      human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak
      supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some
      time prior to the 2014 outbreak.

TI  - Pooled PCR testing strategy and prevalence estimation of submicroscopic
      infections using Bayesian latent class models in pregnant women receiving
      intermittent preventive treatment at Machinga District Hospital, Malawi, 2010.
PG  - 509
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-509 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low malaria parasite densities in pregnancy are a diagnostic
      challenge. PCR provides high sensitivity and specificity in detecting low density
      of parasites, but cost and technical requirements limit its application in
      resources-limited settings. Pooling samples for PCR detection was explored to
      estimate prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infection in pregnant women at
      delivery. Previous work uses gold-standard based methods to calculate sensitivity
      and specificity of tests, creating a challenge when newer methodologies are
      substantially more sensitive than the gold standard. Thus prevalence was
      estimated using Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) in this study. METHODS:
      Nested PCR (nPCR) for the 18S rRNA gene subunit of Plasmodium falciparum was
      conducted to detect malaria infection in microscopy-negative Malawian women on
      IPTp. Two-step sample pooling used dried blood spot samples (DBSs) collected from
      placenta or periphery at delivery. Results from nPCR and histology as well as
      previously published data were used to construct LCMs to estimate assay
      sensitivity and specificity. Theoretical confidence intervals for prevalence of
      infection were calculated for two-step and one-step pooling strategies. RESULTS: 
      Of 617 microscopy-negative Malawian women, 39 (6.3%) were identified as actively 
      infected by histology while 52 (8.4%) were positive by nPCR. One hundred forty
      (22.7%) individuals had past infection assessed by histology. With histology as a
      reference, 72% of women in the active infection group, 7.1% in the past infection
      group and 3.2% in histology-negative group were nPCR positive. Using latent class
      models without a gold standard, histology had a median sensitivity of 49.7% and
      specificity of 97.6% for active infection while PCR had a median sensitivity of
      96.0% and specificity of 99.1%. The true prevalence of active infection was
      estimated at 8.0% (CI: 5.8-10.5%) from PCR. PCR also had similar sensitivity for 
      detecting either peripheral or placental malaria for submicroscopic infections.
      One-step pooling would give similar confidence intervals for pool sizes less than
      20 while reducing the number of tests performed. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled nPCR testing
      was a sensitive and resource-efficient strategy and LCMs provided precise
      prevalence estimates of submicroscopic infections. Compared to two-step pooling, 
      one-step pooling could provide similar prevalence estimates at population levels 
      with many fewer tests required.

TI  - Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium 
      vivax malaria in endemic countries.
PG  - CD011431
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In settings where both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum
      infection cause malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) need to distinguish which 
      species is causing the patients' symptoms, as different treatments are required. 
      Older RDTs incorporated two test lines to distinguish malaria due to P.
      falciparum, from malaria due to any other Plasmodium species (non-falciparum).
      These RDTs can be classified according to which antibodies they use: Type 2 RDTs 
      use HRP-2 (for P. falciparum) and aldolase (all species); Type 3 RDTs use HRP-2
      (for P. falciparum) and pLDH (all species); Type 4 use pLDH (fromP. falciparum)
      and pLDH (all species).More recently, RDTs have been developed to distinguish P. 
      vivax parasitaemia by utilizing a pLDH antibody specific to P. vivax. OBJECTIVES:
      To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting non-falciparum or P.
      vivax parasitaemia in people living in malaria-endemic areas who present to
      ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria, and to
      identify which types and brands of commercial test best detect non-falciparum and
      P. vivax malaria. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook a comprehensive search of the
      following databases up to 31 December 2013: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group
      Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web of
      Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; and IndMED. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies
      comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain
      reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients
      attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in
      non-falciparum endemic areas. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each study, two
      review authors independently extracted a standard set of data using a tailored
      data extraction form. We grouped comparisons by type of RDT (defined by the
      combinations of antibodies used), and combined in meta-analysis where
      appropriate. Average sensitivities and specificities are presented alongside 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI). MAIN RESULTS: We included 47 studies enrolling
      22,862 participants. Patient characteristics, sampling methods and reference
      standard methods were poorly reported in most studies. RDTs detecting
      'non-falciparum' parasitaemiaEleven studies evaluated Type 2 tests compared with 
      microscopy, 25 evaluated Type 3 tests, and 11 evaluated Type 4 tests. In
      meta-analyses, average sensitivities and specificities were 78% (95% CI 73% to
      82%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 2 tests, 78% (95% CI 69% to 84%) and
      99% (95% CI 98% to 99%) for Type 3 tests, and 89% (95% CI 79% to 95%) and 98%
      (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 4 tests, respectively. Type 4 tests were more
      sensitive than both Type 2 (P = 0.01) and Type 3 tests (P = 0.03).Five studies
      compared Type 3 tests with PCR; in meta-analysis, the average sensitivity and
      specificity were 81% (95% CI 72% to 88%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%)
      respectively. RDTs detecting P.vivax parasitaemiaEight studies compared pLDH
      tests to microscopy; the average sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI 86%
      to 99%) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%), respectively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: RDTs
      designed to detect P. vivax specifically, whether alone or as part of a mixed
      infection, appear to be more accurate than older tests designed to distinguish P.
      falciparum malaria from non-falciparum malaria. Compared to microscopy, these
      tests fail to detect around 5% ofP. vivax cases. This Cochrane Review, in
      combination with other published information about in vitro test performance and 
      stability in the field, can assist policy-makers to choose between the available 
      RDTs.

AB  - One hundred and one imported falciparum malaria cases in Wuhan City were
      confirmed by microscopy and Nest-PCR, and the blood samples were collected. The
      Pf60.1 gene was amplified by PCR. Among 101 blood samples, three Pf60.1 fragments
      [313 bp (56.5%, 52/92), 340 bp (37.0%, 34/92), 313 bp+340 bp (6.5%, 6/92)] were
      amplified from 92 samples. Among 83 blood samples from patients returning from
      Africa, 313 bp fragment were found in 46 samples (55.4%, 46/83), 340 bp fragment 
      were found in 31 samples (37.1%, 31/83), and 7.2% (6/83) was mixed-fragment (313 
      bp+340 bp). Among 9 samples from southeast Asia, 6 samples were with 313 bp
      fragment and 3 samples with 340 bp fragment. The results indicated that the most 
      common genotype was 313 bp-genotype, and there would be polyclonal P. falciparum 
      infections.

PG  - 253-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct recombinant plasmid pSPPcGT which contains signal peptide
      peptidase gene of Plasmodium falciparum (PJSPP) and GFP, and transfect into P.
      falciparum (3D7 strain) to obtain mutant parasites which can express PJSPP-GFP.
      METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum(3D7 strain) genomic DNA was extracted from
      cultured malaria parasites. The C-terminal region of PJSPP, an 883 bp gene
      fragment was amplified by PCR, and then cloned into pPM2GT vector to get
      recombinant vector pSPPcGT. The recombinant vectors were identified by PCR,
      double restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. pSPPcGT vector was
      transfected into malaria parasites. The positive clones were selected by adding
      inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase WR99210 to the culture
      medium. The pSPP-GFP-transfected parasites were fixed with methanol, stained with
      DAPI, and observed under immunofluorescence microscope. The PJSPP-GFP expression 
      in P. falciparum was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RESULTS: The
      C-terminal region of PJSPP was amplified from P.falciparum (3D7 strain) genomic
      DNA by PCR with the length of 883 bp. The constructed recombinant vectors were
      identified by PCR screening, double restriction enzyme digestion and DNA
      sequencing. The pSPPcGT vector was transfected into P. falciparum and the
      positive clones were selected by WR99210. GFP fluorescence was observed in
      transfected parasites by immunofluorescence microscopy, and mainly located in the
      cytoplasm. The PJSPP-GFP expression in malaria parasites was confirmed by Western
      blotting with a relative molecular mass of Mr 64,000. CONCLUSION: Recombinant
      vector PJSPP-GFP is constructed and transfected into P. falciparum to obtain P.
      falciparum mutant clone which can express PfSPP-GFP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data are limited for
      artesunate (AS) and amodiaquine (AQ) in uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum.
      METHODS: From 2007-8, 54 P. falciparum-infected, Kenyan adults were assigned
      randomly fixed dose (FD) ASAQ (n = 26) or non-fixed (NF) ASAQ (n = 28). Total
      doses were 600 mg AS (both arms) + 1,620 mg (FD) or 1,836 mg (NF)AQ. Follow-up
      extended over 28 days. PK data were collected for AS, dihydroartemisinin (DHA),
      AS + DHA combined as DHA equivalents (DHAeq), AQ, desethylamodiaquine (DAQ),and
      their relationships assessed against the PD collected data consisting of
      parasitological efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and the Bazett's corrected
      QTinterval (QTcB). RESULTS: Mean AUC 0-72 of dihydroartemisinin equivalents
      (DHAeq) when administered as a fixed dose (FD) compared to NF dose were similar: 
      24.2 +/-4.6 vs 26.4+/-6.9 micromol*h/L (p = 0.68) Parasite clearance rates were
      also similar after 24 hrs: 17/25 (68%) vs 18/28(64.3%) (p = 0.86),as well as at
      48 hrs: 25/8 (100%)vs 26 (92.9%)/28 (p = 0.49). Mean FD vs NF DAQ AUC0-28 were
      27.6+/-3.19 vs 32.7+/-5.53 mg*h/L (p = 0.0005). Two PCR-proven new infections
      occurred on Day (D) 28 for estimated, in vivo, DAQ minimum inhibitory
      concentrations of 15.2 and 27.5 ng/mL. Combining the FD and NF arms, the mean
      QTcB at D2+4 hrs increased significantly (p = 0.0059) vs baseline: 420 vs410 ms (
      = 9.02 (95% confidence interval 2.72-15.31 ms), explained by falling heart rates,
      increasing DAQ concentrations and female sex in a general linear mixed effects
      model. Ten of 108 (9.26%) AEs (5/arm) reported by 37/54 (68.5%) patients were
      possibly or probably drug related. Severe, asymptomatic neutropaenia developed in
      2/47 (4.25%) patients on D28: 574/microL (vsD0: 5,075/microL), and 777/microL
      (vsD0: 3,778/microL). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerability of both formulations was good.
      For QTcB, a parameter for ECG modifications, increases were modest and due to
      rising DAQ concentrations and falling heart rates as malaria resolved. Rapid
      parasite clearance rates and no resistant infections suggest effective

TI  - Efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine for the treatment of acute uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in southern Mauritania.
PG  - 496
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-496 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A regular evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in sentinel sites and a 
      system of surveillance are required to establish treatment guidelines and adapt
      national anti-malarial drug policy to the rapidly changing epidemiology of
      drug-resistant malaria. The current anti-malarial treatment guideline in
      Mauritania, officially recommended since 2006, is based on artemisinin-based
      combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical
      efficacy and tolerance of artesunate-amodiaquine, the first-line treatment for
      acute uncomplicated malaria, in Mauritanian paediatric and adult patients to
      validate its continued use in the country. METHODS: Plasmodium
      falciparum-infected symptomatic patients aged > six months were enrolled in
      Kobeni and Timbedra in southern Mauritania in September to October 2013.
      Co-formulated artesunate-amodiaquine was administered at the recommended dose
      over three days. Patients were followed until day 28. Parasitological and
      clinical response was classified according to the standard 2009 World Health
      Organization protocol. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (65 in Kobeni and 65 in
      Timbedra) were enrolled in the study. Seventeen patients (13.1%) were either
      excluded (before PCR correction) or lost to follow-up. Based on the per protocol 
      analysis, artesunate-amodiaquine efficacy (i.e., the proportion of adequate
      clinical and parasitological response) was 96.6% in Kobeni and 98.2% in Timbedra 
      before PCR correction. Late clinical failure was observed in two patients in
      Kobeni and one patient in Timbedra. After PCR correction, the efficacy rate in
      the two study sites was 98.2%. On day 3, all patients were afebrile and had
      negative smears. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Artesunate-amodiaquine is well tolerated and highly efficacious for the treatment
      of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. In the majority of patients, fever and
      parasitaemia were rapidly cleared before day 3. The results support the national 
      anti-malarial drug guideline for a continued use of artesunate-amodiaquine as a
      first-line drug for uncomplicated malaria in southern Mauritania.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms associated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance 
      among Plasmodium falciparum field isolates in malaria endemic areas of Assam.
PG  - 9-14
LID - 10.4103/0022-3859.147019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of antimalarial drug resistance malaria parasite is
      widespread in North eastern region of India. During January 2012-December 2013,
      we conducted active surveillance for detection of antifolate
      resistance-associated genetic polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      parasite from different malaria endemic areas of Assam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 281 field samples were collected from suspected malaria patients of
      which 106 malaria P. falciparum positive cases were detected in microscopic slide
      examination. A nested PCR was done for amplification of a 648 bp portion of the
      dhfr gene and 710 bp portion of the dhps gene. RESULTS: Mutation analysis
      revealed existence of three different haplotypes of the P. falciparum dhfr gene
      of which ANRNI was highly prevalent (90%). Triple mutant haplotypes AIRNI
      (N51I+C59R+S108N) of the dhfr gene associated with pyrimethamine resistance were 
      prevalent in Chirang district of Assam. Whereas, dhps mutation study revealed
      that triple mutant haplotype AGEAA (S436A+A437G+K540E) associated with
      Sulphadoxine resistance was found among 26% of P. falciparum field isolates.
      However, P. falciparum dhfr-dhps two locus mutation analysis showed that there
      were a total of nine dhfr-dhps genotypes. CONCLUSION: It was noticed that 93.62% 
      (88/94) isolates had mutations in the sequences of both enzymes, which is an
      indication of prevalence of high grade of Sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine resistance
      in P. falciparum malaria parasites in Assam.

PG  - 81-5
LID - 10.1093/tropej/fmu069 [doi]
AB  - We recorded the reason for presentation to a rural hospital in an area endemic
      for malaria in 909 children between January 2006 and March 2009. Blood smears
      were examined for Plasmodium falciparum parasites, and blood spots dried on
      filter paper were prepared for 464 children. A PCR assay utilizing the stored
      blood spots was developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae (lytA) and Haemophilus
      influenzae (pal). Malaria was present in 299 children whose blood was tested by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 19 had lytA and 15 had pal. The overall
      prevalence of lytA was 25 of the 464 children, while that of pal was 18 children.
      Fever was present in 369 children of whom 19 had lytA DNA while 11 had pal DNA
      detected. Of the 95 afebrile children, six had lytA and seven pal. We conclude
      that there are no clinical features that distinguish malaria alone from
      bacteremia alone or the presence of both infections.

TI  - PfRON3 is an erythrocyte-binding protein and a potential blood-stage vaccine
      candidate antigen.
PG  - 490
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-490 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Erythrocyte invasion by merozoites is an essential step in Plasmodium
      falciparum infection and leads to subsequent disease pathology. Proteins both on 
      the merozoite surface and secreted from the apical organelles (micronemes,
      rhoptries and dense granules) mediate the invasion of erythrocytes; some of the
      molecules have been regarded as targets in the development of an anti-malaria
      vaccine. Recently, a subgroup of rhoptry neck proteins (PfRON2, PfRON4 and
      PfRON5) associated with the microneme protein apical membrane antigen AMA1 has
      been described as components of the moving junction complex that assists
      merozoite invasion into erythrocytes. However, unlike PfRON2, PfRON4 and PfRON5, 
      the latest study suggested that PfRON3 might be located in the rhoptry bulb and
      participates in a novel PfRON complex (PfRON2, 3 and 4), but does not form a
      complex with AMA1. Additionally, the full-length PfRON3 protein possesses three
      transmembrane regions at the N-terminus, which is highly conserved among RON3
      orthologues in the genus Plasmodium, Toxoplasma gondii and Eimeria tenella.
      Overall, these findings suggest that PfRON3 may play an important role in
      merozoite invasion into erythrocytes. RESULTS: PfRON3 was primarily expressed
      during the late trophozoite stage, with a peak in transcription levels at 40
      hours post-invasion. The subcellular localization of PfRON3 was confirmed that it
      is a merozoite rhoptry bulb protein. Additionally, the recombinant form of PfRON3
      protein bound to the erythrocyte and was recognized by sera collected from
      malaria endemic areas in Africa, and anti-PfRON3 antibodies significantly
      inhibited merozoite invasion into erythrocytes. METHODS: The expression of PfRON3
      was analysed via real-time quantitative PCR, and the recombinant PfRON3 proteins 
      were generated with an Escherichia coli expression system. The subcellular
      localization of PfRON3 was assessed with immunoelectron microscopy and
      immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The recognition PfRON3 by malaria immune sera was
      analysed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Erythrocyte-binding
      assays were performed using recombinant PfRON3 proteins and invasion inhibition
      assays were carried out with PfRON3-specific antibodies. CONCLUSION: This study
      confirmed that PfRON3 is a rhoptry protein with an erythrocyte-binding property, 
      which is likely associated red blood cell invasion. PfRON3 is a potential vaccine
      candidate.

AB  - Studies on autochthonous malaria in low-transmission areas in Brazil have
      acquired epidemiological relevance because they suggest continued transmission in
      what remains of the Atlantic Forest. In the southeastern portion of the state of 
      Sao Paulo, outbreaks in the municipality of Juquitiba have been the focus of
      studies on the prevalence of Plasmodium, including asymptomatic cases. Data on
      the occurrence of the disease or the presence of antiplasmodial antibodies in
      pregnant women from this region have not previously been described. Although
      Plasmodium falciparum in pregnant women has been widely addressed in the
      literature, the interaction of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae with this
      cohort has been poorly explored to date. We monitored the circulation of
      Plasmodium in pregnant women in health facilities located in Juquitiba using
      thick blood film and molecular protocols, as well as immunological assays, to
      evaluate humoural immune parameters. Through real-time and nested polymerase
      chain reaction, P. vivax and P. malariae were detected for the first time in
      pregnant women, with a positivity of 5.6%. Immunoassays revealed the presence of 
      IgG antibodies: 44% for ELISA-Pv, 38.4% for SD-Bioline-Pv and 18.4% for indirect 
      immunofluorescence assay-Pm. The high prevalence of antibodies showed significant
      exposure of this population to Plasmodium. In regions with similar profiles,
      testing for a malaria diagnosis might be indicated in prenatal care.

TI  - Severe vivax malaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies
      since 1900.
PG  - 481
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax was long considered to have a low 
      mortality, but recent reports from some geographical areas suggest that severe
      and complicated vivax malaria may be more common than previously thought.
      METHODS: The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to
      describe the reported clinical characteristics and the geographical variation in 
      prevalence of reported severe vivax malaria and its change over time derived from
      English-language articles published since 1900. Medline and Scopus databases were
      searched for original papers on severe vivax malaria, using as inclusion criteria
      modified 2010 WHO criteria for the diagnosis of severe falciparum malaria.
      Articles before 1949 were identified through reference lists in journals,
      textbooks, and personal collections of colleagues. RESULTS: A total of 77 studies
      with reported severe vivax malaria and 63 studies with no reported severe vivax
      malaria (totaling 46,411 and 6,753 vivax malaria patients, respectively) were
      included. The 77 studies with reported severe vivax malaria were mainly from
      India (n = 33), USA (n = 8), Indonesia (n = 6), and Pakistan (n = 6). Vivax
      endemic countries not reporting severe vivax malaria beyond individual case
      reports included: the Greater Mekong Sub-region, China, North Korea, Bangladesh, 
      Afghanistan, Middle East (except Qatar), the horn of Africa, and Madagascar. Only
      17/77 reports were from before 2000. Vivax mono-infection was confirmed by PCR in
      14 studies and co-morbidities were ruled out in 23 studies. Among the 77 studies 
      reporting severe vivax malaria, severe thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mm3) was the
      most common "severe" manifestation (888/45,775 with pooled prevalence of 8.6%).
      The case fatality was 0.3% (353/46,411). Severity syndromes varied widely between
      different geographical areas, with severe anaemia being most prominent in areas
      of high transmission and chloroquine resistance. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium vivax can
      cause severe and even fatal disease, but there is a recent increase in reports
      over the past 15 years with larger series restricted to a limited number of
      geographical areas. The biological basis of these variations is currently not
      known. More detailed epidemiological studies are needed which dissociate
      causation from association to refine the definition and estimate the prevalence
      of severe vivax malaria.

AB  - Submicroscopic infections account for more than 50% of all Plasmodium (P.)
      infections in areas with decreasing malaria prevalence and might contribute to
      poor pregnancy outcomes. The frequency of submicroscopic P. falciparum infections
      was assessed in matched peripheral and placental blood samples with microscopy
      negative or discordant results according to IPTp administration. Methods. P.
      falciparum infection was detected by nested PCR in matched blood samples
      collected from delivering women with a history of antimalarial drug treatment and
      living in Gabon. Results. Submicroscopic P. falciparum infections were detected
      in 87% (n = 33) of the 44 selected matched samples. Plasmodial DNA was found in
      90% (n = 35/39) and 87% (n = 33/38) of microscopy negative peripheral and
      placental blood samples, respectively. Overall, 95% of samples obtained during
      the high IPTp-SP coverage period had a submicroscopic infection versus 79% among 
      those from the low coverage period. Conclusion. Submicroscopic infections
      frequency is high in peripheral and placental blood samples from delivering women
      with a history of antimalarial treatment whatever the level of IPTp coverage.
      These data highlight the need of accurate diagnostic tools for a regular
      antenatal screening of malaria during the pregnancy in endemic areas.

TI  - The dimerization domain of PfCENP-C is required for its functions as a centromere
      protein in human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 475
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The conserved centromere-associated proteins, CENH3 (or CENP-A) and
      CENP-C are indispensable for the functional centromere-kinetochore assembly,
      chromosome segregation, cell cycle progression, and viability. The presence and
      functions of centromere proteins in Plasmodium falciparum are not well studied.
      Identification of PfCENP-C, an inner kinetochore protein (the homologue of human 
      CENP-C) and its co-localization with PfCENH3 was recently reported. This study
      aims to decipher the functions of inner kinetochore protein, PfCENP-C as a
      centromere protein in P. falciparum. METHODS: Bio-informatic tools were employed 
      to demarcate the two conserved domains of PfCENP-C, and the functions of PfCENP-C
      domains were demonstrated by functional complementation assays in the temperature
      sensitive (TS) mutant strains (mif2-3 and mif2-2) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      with MIF2p (the yeast homologue of CENP-C) loss-of-function. By site-directed
      mutagenesis, the key residues essential for PfCENP-C functions were determined.
      The chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out to determine the in vivo
      binding of PfCENP-C to the Plasmodium centromeres and the in vivo interactions of
      PfCENP-C with PfCENH3, and mitotic spindles were shown by co-immunopreciptation
      experiments. RESULTS: The studies demonstrate that the motif and the dimerization
      domain of PfCENP-C is able to functionally complement MIF2p functions. The
      essential role of some of the key residues: F1993, F1996 and Y2069 within the
      PfCENP-C dimerization domain in mediating its functions and maintenance of
      mitotic spindle integrity is evident from this study. The pull-down assays show
      the association of PfCENP-C with PfCENH3 and mitotic spindles. The ChIP-PCR
      experiments confirm PfCENP-C-enriched Plasmodium centromeres. These studies thus 
      provide an insight into the roles of this inner kinetochore protein and establish
      that the centromere proteins are evolutionary conserved in the parasite.
      CONCLUSIONS: PfCENP-C is a true CENP-C homologue in P. falciparum which binds to 
      the centromeric DNA and its dimerization domain is essential for its in vivo
      functions as a centromere protein. The identification and functional
      characterization of the P. falciparum centromeric proteins will provide
      mechanistic insights into some of the mitotic events that occur during the
      chromosome segregation in human malaria parasite, P. falciparum.

TI  - Malaria surveillance--United States, 2012.
PG  - 1-22
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of
      the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective
      female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United
      States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria
      transmission. However, malaria is also occasionally acquired by persons who have 
      not traveled out of the country, through exposure to infected blood products,
      congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne
      transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify 
      episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for
      travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of 
      symptoms in 2012 and summarizes trends during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF
      SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or
      rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be reported to local and state health
      departments by health-care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are
      conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to
      CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), National Notifiable 
      Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consults. For the first time,
      CDC conducted antimalarial drug resistance testing on blood samples submitted to 
      CDC by health-care providers or local/state health departments. Data from these
      reporting systems serve as the basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received 1,687
      reported cases of malaria with an onset of symptoms in 2012 among persons in the 
      United States, including 1,683 cases classified as imported, one
      laboratory-acquired case, one nosocomial case, and two cryptic cases. The total
      number of cases represents a 12% decrease from the 1,925 cases reported for 2011.
      Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in
      58%, 17%, 3%, and 3% of cases, respectively. Twenty (1%) patients were infected
      by two species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 17% of
      cases, a decrease of 6 percentage points from 2011. Polymerase chain reaction
      testing determined or corrected the species for 45 (43%) of the 104 samples
      submitted for drug resistance testing. Of the 909 patients who reported purpose
      of travel, 604 (66%) were visiting friends or relatives (VFR). Among the 983
      cases in U.S. civilians for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel
      region was known, 63 (6%) patients reported that they had followed and adhered to
      a chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to which they 
      had traveled. Thirty-two cases were reported in pregnant women, among whom only
      one adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported cases, 231 (14%) were
      classified as severe infections in 2012. Of these, six persons with malaria died 
      in 2012. Beginning in 2012, there were 104 blood samples submitted to CDC that
      were tested for molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance.
      Of the 65 P. falciparum-positive samples, 53 (82%) had genetic polymorphisms
      associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 61 (94%) with sulfadoxine
      resistance, 29 (45%) with chloroquine resistance, 1 (2%) with mefloquine drug
      resistance, 2 (3%) with atovaquone resistance, and none with artemisinin
      resistance. INTERPRETATION: Despite the 12% decline in the number of cases
      reported in 2012 compared with 2011, the overall trend in malaria cases has been 
      increasing since 1973. Although progress has been made in reducing the global
      burden of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many regions, and the use of
      appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH
      ACTIONS: Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased
      slightly in 2012 compared with 2011, but still remains unacceptably low. This
      incomplete reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and
      prevent infections. VFRs continue to be a difficult population to reach with
      effective malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies
      that effectively target VFRs need to be developed and implemented to have a
      substantial impact on the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States.
      Although more patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria, the
      majority reported not taking it, and adherence was poor among those who did take 
      chemoprophylaxis. Proper use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will prevent the
      majority of malaria illness and reduce the risk for severe disease
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be
      fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications
      appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of
      malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent
      molecular laboratory advances have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular 
      surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html). These advances will allow CDC to 
      track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistant malaria parasites both
      domestically and globally. For this to be successful, specimens should be
      submitted for cases diagnosed in the United States and for ongoing specimen
      collection and testing globally. Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for
      Treatment of Malaria and contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management
      advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained online
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling the Malaria
      Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713).

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is unique among human malarias in its ability to sequester 
      in post-capillary venules of host organs. The main variant antigens implicated
      are the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which can be
      divided into three major groups (A-C). Our study was a unique examination of
      sequestered populations of parasites for genetic background and expression of
      PfEMP1 groups. We collected post-mortem tissue from twenty paediatric hosts with 
      pathologically different forms of cerebral malaria (CM1 and CM2) and parasitaemic
      controls (PC) to directly examine sequestered populations of parasites in the
      brain, heart and gut. Use of two different techniques to investigate this
      question produced divergent results. By quantitative PCR, group A var genes were 
      upregulated in all three organs of CM2 and PC cases. In contrast, in CM1
      infections displaying high levels of sequestration but negligible vascular
      pathology, there was high expression of group B var. Cloning and sequencing of
      var transcript tags from the same samples indicated a uniformly low expression of
      group A-like var. Generally, within an organ sample, 1-2 sequences were expressed
      at dominant levels. 23% of var tags were detected in multiple patients despite
      the P. falciparum infections being genetically distinct, and two tags were
      observed in up to seven hosts each with high expression in the brains of 3-4
      patients. This study is a novel examination of the sequestered parasites
      responsible for fatal cerebral malaria and describes expression patterns of the
      major cytoadherence ligand in three organ-derived populations and three
      pathological states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin and 
      its derivatives, manifested as delayed parasite clearance following the
      treatment, has developed in Southeast Asia. The spread of resistance to
      artemisinin from Asia to Africa may be catastrophic for malaria control and
      elimination worldwide. Recently, mutations in the propeller domain of the Kelch
      13 (k13) gene (PF3D71343700) were associated with in vitro resistance to
      artemisinin and with delayed clearance after artemisinin treatment in southern
      Asia. The aim of the study was to characterize the genetic variability of k13 and
      to evaluate the molecular resistance to artemisinin for the first time in
      Senegal. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected from 138 malaria 
      patients in Dakar and its districts during the rainy season of October 2012 to
      January 2013 at the Hopital Principal de Dakar. The k13 gene was amplified using 
      nested PCR and sequenced. RESULTS: A very limited variability within the k13 gene
      in Senegalese P. falciparum isolates was identified. No polymorphism was detected
      in the six k13-propeller blades. Only two mutations, T149S (6.3%) and K189T
      (42.2%), and one (N) or two (NN) asparagine insertion at the codon 142 (4.7 and
      6.3%, respectively) were detected in the Plasmodium/Apicomplexa-specific domain. 
      None of the polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast
      Asia was detected in the 138 P. falciparum from Dakar. DISCUSSION: The present
      data do not suggest widespread artemisinin resistance in Dakar in 2012-2013.
      Notably, the C580Y, R539T or Y493H substitutions that were associated with in
      vitro resistance or delayed parasite clearance in Southeast Asia were not
      observed in Dakar, nor were any of the polymorphisms observed in parasites from
      Southeast Asia, nor the M476I mutation that was selected in vitro with
      artemisinin pressure in a African parasite line.

AB  - Understanding how malaria parasites move between populations is important,
      particularly given the potential for malaria to be reintroduced into areas where 
      it was previously eliminated. We examine the distribution of malaria genetics
      across seven sites within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and two nearby
      countries, Ghana and Kenya, in order to understand how the relatedness of malaria
      parasites varies across space, and whether there are barriers to the flow of
      malaria parasites within the DRC or across borders. Parasite DNA was retrieved
      from dried blood spots from 7 Demographic and Health Survey sample clusters in
      the DRC. Malaria genetic characteristics of parasites from Ghana and Kenya were
      also obtained. For each of 9 geographic sites (7 DRC, 1 Ghana and 1 Kenya), a
      pair-wise RST statistic was calculated, indicating the genetic distance between
      malaria parasites found in those locations. Mapping genetics across the spatial
      extent of the study area indicates a complex genetic landscape, where relatedness
      between two proximal sites may be relatively high (RST > 0.64) or low (RST <
      0.05), and where distal sites also exhibit both high and low genetic similarity. 
      Mantel's tests suggest that malaria genetics differ as geographic distances
      increase. Principal Coordinate Analysis suggests that genetically related samples
      are not co-located. Barrier analysis reveals no significant barriers to gene flow
      between locations. Malaria genetics in the DRC have a complex and fragmented
      landscape. Limited exchange of genes across space is reflected in greater genetic
      distance between malaria parasites isolated at greater geographic distances.
      There is, however, evidence for close genetic ties between distally located
      sample locations, indicating that movement of malaria parasites and flow of genes
      is being driven by factors other than distance decay. This research demonstrates 
      the contributions that spatial disease ecology and landscape genetics can make to
      understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.

AB  - Glutamate-rich protein is a Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) antigen found in all
      stages of the parasite and has been reported to induce clinical immunity. The R0 
      and R2 regions have been found to exhibit a high degree of conservation,
      therefore serving as a good vaccine design material. We assayed the genetic
      diversity of Pf glurp genes in the R0 and R2 regions, as well as evaluated the
      role of seasonality on allelic frequency. A total of 402 genomic DNA samples,
      extracted from filter paper blood samples, were screened by nested polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) analysis of Pf glurp R0 and R2 regions, in addition to
      fragment analysis of the polymorphic regions to identify allelic diversity of the
      parasite population. We found an extensive heterogeneity in the R2 region in
      general, and this heterogeneity is seasonally dependent, indicative of region
      plasticity. The R0 region displayed genetic conservation, as expected. We
      conclude that positive genotyping results with glurp R0 region should be seen as 
      indicative of an active Pf infection, requiring adequate treatment. In addition, 
      we advocate extending the possibility that an R0 region genotypic positivity
      could serve as diagnostic tool, thereby reducing cases of untreated or poorly
      treated infection, contributory to recrudescence or treatment failure.

AB  - The recent emergence and spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum
      isolates is a growing concern for global malaria-control efforts. A recent
      genome-wide analysis study identified two SNPs at genomic positions MAL10-688956 
      and MAL13-1718319, which are linked to delayed clearance of parasites following
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). It is expected that continuous artemisinin
      pressure will affect the distribution of these SNPs. Here, we investigate the
      worldwide distribution of these SNPs using a large number of archived samples in 
      order to generate baseline data from the period before the emergence of ACT
      resistance. The presence of SNPs in MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 was assessed
      by nested PCR RFLP and direct DNA sequencing using 653 global P. falciparum
      samples obtained before the reported emergence of ACT resistance. SNPs at
      MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 associated with delayed parasite clearance
      following ACT administration were observed in 8% and 3% of parasites,
      respectively, mostly in Cambodia and Thailand. Parasites harbouring both SNPs
      were found in only eight (1%) isolates, all of which were from Cambodia and
      Thailand. Linkage disequilibrium was detected between MAL10-688956 and
      MAL13-1718319, suggesting that this SNP combination may have been selected by ACT
      drug pressure. Neither of the SNPs associated with delayed parasite clearance
      were observed in samples from Africa or South America. Baseline information of
      the geographical difference of MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 SNPs provides a
      solid basis for assessing whether these SNPs are selected by artemisinin-based
      combination therapies.

AB  - We investigated the mechanisms of resistance of two antimalarial drugs
      piperaquine (PQ) and lumefantrine (LM) using the rodent parasite Plasmodium
      berghei as a surrogate of the human parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. We analyzed 
      the whole coding sequence of Plasmodium berghei chloroquine resistance
      transporter (Pbcrt) and Plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance gene 1(Pbmdr-1)
      for polymorphisms. These genes are associated with quinoline resistance in
      Plasmodium falciparum. No polymorphic changes were detected in the coding
      sequences of Pbcrt and Pbmdr1 or in the mRNA transcript levels of Pbmdr1.
      However, our data demonstrated that PQ and LM resistance is achieved by multiple 
      mechanisms that include elevated mRNA transcript levels of V-type H(+) pumping
      pyrophosphatase (vp2), Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter (vcx1), gamma glutamylcysteine
      synthetase (ggcs) and glutathione-S-transferase (gst) genes, mechanisms also
      known to contribute to chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum and rodent malaria
      parasites. The increase in ggcs and gst transcript levels was accompanied by high
      glutathione (GSH) levels and elevated activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
      enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Pbcrt and Pbmdr1 are not
      associated with PQ and LM resistance in P. berghei ANKA, while vp2, vcx1, ggcs
      and gst may mediate resistance directly or modulate functional mutations in other
      unknown genes.

AB  - Invasion of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae midgut by Plasmodium parasites
      triggers transcriptional changes of immune genes that mediate the antiparasitic
      defense. This response is largely regulated by the Toll and Immune deficiency
      (IMD) pathways. To determine whether A. gambiae microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved
      in regulating the anti-Plasmodium defense, we showed that suppression of miRNA
      biogenesis results in increased resistance to Plasmodium falciparum infection. In
      silico analysis of A. gambiae immune effector genes identified multiple
      transcripts with miRNA binding sites. A comparative miRNA microarray abundance
      analysis of P. falciparum infected and naive mosquito midgut tissues showed
      elevated abundance of miRNAs aga-miR-989 and aga-miR-305 in infected midguts.
      Antagomir inhibition of aga-miR-305 increased resistance to P. falciparum
      infection and suppressed the midgut microbiota. Conversely, treatment of
      mosquitoes with an artificial aga-miR-305 mimic increased susceptibility to P.
      falciparum infection and resulted in expansion of midgut microbiota, suggesting
      that aga-miR-305 acts as a P. falciparum and gut microbiota agonist by negatively
      regulating the mosquito immune response. In silico prediction of aga-miR-305
      target genes identified several anti-Plasmodium effectors. Our study shows that
      A. gambiae aga-miR-305 regulates the anti-Plasmodium response and midgut
      microbiota, likely through post-transcriptional modification of immune effector
      genes.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of fixed-dose artesunate-amodiaquine vs.
      artemether-lumefantrine for repeated treatment of uncomplicated malaria in
      Ugandan children.
PG  - e113311
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0113311 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The safety and efficacy of the two most widely used fixed-dose
      artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and 
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are well established for single episodes of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the effects of repeated,
      long-term use are not well documented. We conducted a 2-year randomized,
      open-label, longitudinal, phase IV clinical trial comparing the efficacy and
      safety of fixed-dose ASAQ and AL for repeated treatment of uncomplicated malaria 
      in children under 5 years at Nagongera Health Centre, Uganda. Participants were
      randomized to ASAQ or AL and all subsequent malaria episodes were treated with
      the same regimen. 413 children were enrolled and experienced a total of 6027
      malaria episodes (mean 15; range, 1-26). For the first malaria episode, the
      PCR-corrected-cure rate for ASAQ (97.5%) was non-inferior to that for AL (97.0%; 
      95% CI [-0.028; 0.037]). PCR-corrected cure rates for subsequent malaria episodes
      that had over 100 cases (episodes 2-18), ranged from 88.1% to 98.9% per episode, 
      with no clear difference between the treatment arms. Parasites were completely
      cleared by day 3 for all malaria episodes and gametocyte carriage was less than
      1% by day 21. Fever clearance was faster in the ASAQ group for the first episode.
      Treatment compliance for subsequent episodes (only first dose administration
      observed) was close to 100%. Adverse events though common were similar between
      treatment arms and mostly related to the disease. Serious adverse events were
      uncommon, comparable between treatment arms and resolved spontaneously. Anemia
      and neutropenia occurred in <0.5% of cases per episode, abnormal liver function
      tests occurred in 0.3% to 1.4% of cases. Both regimens were safe and effective
      for repeated treatment of malaria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials 
      NCT00699920.

TI  - Mass screening and treatment on the basis of results of a Plasmodium
      falciparum-specific rapid diagnostic test did not reduce malaria incidence in
      Zanzibar.
PG  - 1476-83
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal increases in malaria continue in hot spots in Zanzibar. Mass
      screening and treatment (MSAT) may help reduce the reservoir of infection;
      however, it is unclear whether rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect a sufficient 
      proportion of low-density infections to influence subsequent transmission.
      METHODS: Two rounds of MSAT using Plasmodium falciparum-specific RDT were
      conducted in 5 hot spots (population, 12 000) in Zanzibar in 2012. In parallel,
      blood samples were collected on filter paper for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      analyses. Data on confirmed malarial parasite infections from health facilities
      in intervention and hot spot control areas were monitored as proxy for malaria
      transmission. RESULTS: Approximately 64% of the population (7859) were screened
      at least once. P. falciparum prevalence, as measured by RDT, was 0.2% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], .1%-.3%) in both rounds, compared with PCR measured
      prevalences (for all species) of 2.5% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.9%) and 3.8% (95% CI,
      3.2%-4.4%) in rounds 1 and 2, respectively. Two fifths (40%) of infections
      detected by PCR included non-falciparum species. Treatment of RDT-positive
      individuals (4% of the PCR-detected parasite carriers) did not reduce subsequent 
      malaria incidence, compared with control areas. CONCLUSIONS: Highly sensitive
      point-of-care diagnostic tools for detection of all human malaria species are
      needed to make MSAT an effective strategy in settings where malaria elimination
      programs are in the pre-elimination phase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a real-time PCR assay known as photo-induced electron
      transfer (PET)-PCR which relies on self-quenching primers for the detection of
      Plasmodium spp. and Plasmodium falciparum was described. PET-PCR assay was found 
      to be robust, and easier to use when compared to currently available real-time
      PCR methods. The potential of PET-PCR for molecular detection of malaria
      parasites in a nationwide malaria community survey in Haiti was investigated.
      METHODS: DNA from the dried blood spots was extracted using QIAGEN methodology.
      All 2,989 samples were screened using the PET-PCR assay in duplicate. Samples
      with a cycle threshold (CT) of 40 or less were scored as positive. A subset of
      the total samples (534) was retested using a nested PCR assay for confirmation.
      In addition, these same samples were also tested using a TaqMan-based real-time
      PCR assay. RESULTS: A total of 12 out of the 2,989 samples screened (0.4%) were
      found to be positive by PET-PCR (mean CT value of 35.7). These same samples were 
      also found to be positive by the nested and TaqMan-based methods. The nested PCR 
      detected an additional positive sample in a subset of 534 samples that was not
      detected by either PET-PCR or TaqMan-based PCR method. CONCLUSION: While the
      nested PCR was found to be slightly more sensitive than the PET-PCR, it is not
      ideal for high throughput screening of samples. Given the ease of use and lower
      cost than the nested PCR, the PET-PCR provides an alternative assay for the rapid
      screening of a large number of samples in laboratory settings.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of a combination of azithromycin and chloroquine for the
      treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in two multi-country
      randomised clinical trials in African adults.
PG  - 458
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of resistance to existing therapy, new options
      for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria are needed. METHODS: Two randomised,
      comparative, non-inferiority studies were conducted in Africa, one double-blinded
      and one open-label. Adults with fever, a positive peripheral blood smear, and a
      positive rapid diagnostic test for Plasmodium falciparum were randomised in both 
      studies to either azithromycin (AZ) 1,000 mg plus chloroquine (CQ) 600-mg base
      (AZCQ 1,000 mg) once daily for three days or mefloquine hydrochloride (MQ) 1,250 
      mg (split dose). In the first study, an additional regimen of AZ 500 mg plus CQ
      600-mg base (AZCQ 500 mg) once daily for three days was included. All study
      participants were hospitalised until three consecutive daily blood smears were
      negative for asexual P. falciparum parasitaemia. Study participants were
      evaluated weekly for 42 days, with Day 28 polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-corrected parasitological clearance rate as primary endpoint. RESULTS: A
      total of 467 subjects were randomised in the two studies. At 28 days' follow-up, 
      PCR-corrected parasitological clearance rates in the per protocol population in
      the first study were 101/103 (98%) with AZCQ 1,000 mg compared with 102/103 (99%)
      with MQ (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.2, 3.3). The AZCQ 500-mg regimen was
      stopped during an interim study review (six [86%] clearance of seven evaluable;
      two lost to follow-up). In the second study, clearance rates were similar: AZCQ
      1,000 mg 107/107 (100%) vs MQ 111/112 (99%; 95% CI: -1.8, 3.6). Among the
      participating countries, in vitro CQ resistance based on pfcrt mutation frequency
      in the baseline isolates across both studies ranged from 20.8% (Zambia) to 96.1% 
      (Uganda). Serious adverse events (AEs; all causality) were observed more
      frequently with MQ compared with AZCQ (four vs one, respectively), though
      discontinuations for AEs were similar (four vs three, respectively). Common AEs
      in the AZ-containing arms included pruritus, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.
      CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with symptomatic uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      Africa, the combination of AZ 1,000 mg and CQ 600-mg base once daily for three
      days resulted in Day 28 PCR-corrected parasitological clearance rates of >/=98%
      and was non-inferior to treatment with MQ. AZCQ was well tolerated. TRIAL

TI  - Treatment of Whole Blood With Riboflavin and UV Light: Impact on Malaria Parasite
      Viability and Whole Blood Storage.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1097/SHK.0000000000000280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan African countries utilize whole blood (WB) to treat
      severe anemia secondary to severe blood loss or malaria on an emergency basis. In
      many areas with high prevalence of transfusion-transmissible agents, blood safety
      measures are insufficient. Pathogen reduction technology applied to WB might
      considerably improve blood safety. METHODS: Whole blood from 40 different donors 
      were treated with riboflavin and UV light (pathogen reduction technology) in
      order to inactivate malaria parasite replication. The extent of parasite
      inactivation was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods 
      and was correlated to studies evaluating the replication of malaria parasites in 
      culture. Products were also stored for 21 days at +4 degrees C and monitored for 
      cell quality throughout storage. RESULTS: Plasmodium amplicon was present in 21
      samples (>100 copies/mL), doubtful in four (10-100 genome equivalents [gEq]/mL), 
      and negative in 15 U. The majority of asymptomatic parasitemic donors carried low
      parasite levels, with only six donors above 5,000 copies/mL (15%). After
      treatment with riboflavin and UV light, these six samples demonstrated a 0.5 to
      1.2 log reduction in quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification. This
      correlated to equal to or greater than 6.4 log reductions in infectivity. In
      treated WB units, cell quality parameters remained stable; however, plasma
      hemoglobin increased to 0.15 g/dL. All markers behaved similarly to published
      data for stored, untreated WB. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogen reduction technology
      treatment can inactivate malaria parasites in WB while maintaining adequate blood
      quality during posttreatment cold storage for 21 days.

TI  - Temporal and seasonal changes of genetic polymorphisms associated with altered
      drug susceptibility to chloroquine, lumefantrine, and quinine in Guinea-Bissau
      between 2003 and 2012.
PG  - 872-9
LID - 10.1128/AAC.03554-14 [doi]
AB  - In 2008, artemether-lumefantrine was introduced in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa,
      but quinine has also been commonly prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated 
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. An efficacious high-dose chloroquine treatment
      regimen was used previously. Temporal and seasonal changes of genetic
      polymorphisms associated with altered drug susceptibility to chloroquine,
      lumefantrine, and quinine have been described. P. falciparum chloroquine
      resistance transporter (pfcrt) K76T, pfmdr1 gene copy numbers, pfmdr1
      polymorphisms N86Y and Y184F, and pfmdr1 sequences 1034 to 1246 were determined
      using PCR-based methods. Blood samples came from virtually all (n=1,806)
      children<15 years of age who had uncomplicated P. falciparum monoinfection and
      presented at a health center in suburban Bissau (from 2003 to 2012). The pfcrt
      K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y frequencies were stable, and seasonal changes were not seen 
      from 2003 to 2007. Since 2007, the mean annual frequencies increased (P<0.001)
      for pfcrt 76T (24% to 57%), pfmdr1 N86 (72% to 83%), and pfcrt 76+pfmdr1 86 TN
      (10% to 27%), and pfcrt 76T accumulated during the high transmission season
      (P=0.001). The pfmdr1 86+184 NF frequency increased from 39% to 66% (from 2003 to
      2011; P=0.004). One sample had two pfmdr1 gene copies. pfcrt 76T was associated
      with a lower parasite density (P<0.001). Following the discontinuation of an
      effective chloroquine regimen, probably highly
      artemether-lumefantrine-susceptible P. falciparum (with pfcrt 76T) accumulated,
      possibly due to suboptimal use of quinine and despite a fitness cost linked to
      pfcrt 76T. (The studies reported here were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under

      microwave irradiation and loop mediated isothermal amplification.
PG  - 454
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved living conditions together with appropriate diagnosis can
      reduce avoidable malarial deaths substantially. Microscopy remains the gold
      standard in the diagnosis of malaria. However, rapid molecular diagnostic tests
      (RmDT) are becoming increasingly important and will, most likely, be the
      diagnostic techniques of choice in the next years. METHODS: In this study, a
      rapid and reliable nucleic acid extraction procedure from human blood and
      malarial parasites using microwave irradiation as a promising platform is
      described. In addition, a tailored loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 
      methodology that utilizes hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and Bst 2.0 DNA polymerases 
      in molecular detection of malarial parasites is described. RESULTS: Following
      microwave irradiation for DNA isolation, conventional PCR assays were able to
      detect up to five malaria parasites/mul. The LAMP methodology described here was 
      capable to detect as low as one Plasmodium falciparum parasite/mul after DNA
      extraction by microwave irradiation. A turnover time of 45 minutes from nucleic
      acid extraction to final visual read-out was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The described
      procedure offers a cheap, simple and fast method of molecular detection of
      malaria parasites. This test can easily be performed in basic laboratories. The
      methodology has been validated as a proof of concept and has specifically be
      developed for use at low-resource settings. Such RmDTs may aid health providers
      to make timely therapeutic interventions in malaria endemic regions.

AB  - Here, we report a case of a Bulgarian patient with imported falciparum malaria
      that manifested 6 days after his arrival in Bulgaria, which was complicated by
      bloody diarrhea 2 days later. Blood smear revealed high parasitemia, with annular
      forms and gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, RNA of the
      Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus was detected in the blood sample by 
      real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and nested RT-PCR. The obtained sequence
      was found to be clustered within the Europe 1 lineage close to the other
      Bulgarian strains. Notably, the two infectious diseases may appear with many
      similar symptoms that are difficult to distinguish.

TI  - Hemozoin induces hepatic inflammation in mice and is differentially associated
      with liver pathology depending on the Plasmodium strain.
PG  - e113519
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0113519 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a global disease that clinically affects more than two hundred million
      people annually. Despite the availability of effective antimalarials, mortality
      rates associated with severe complications are high. Hepatopathy is frequently
      observed in patients with severe malarial disease and its pathogenesis is poorly 
      understood. Previously, we observed high amounts of hemozoin or malaria pigment
      in livers from infected mice. In this study, we investigated whether hemozoin is 
      associated with liver injury in different mouse malaria models. C57BL/6J mice
      infected with the rodent parasites Plasmodium berghei ANKA, P. berghei NK65 or P.
      chabaudi AS had elevated serum liver enzymes without severe histological changes 
      in the liver, in line with the observations in most patients. Furthermore, liver 
      enzymes were significantly higher in serum of P. chabaudi AS-infected mice
      compared to mice infected with the P. berghei parasite strains and a strong
      positive correlation was found between hepatic hemozoin levels, hepatocyte damage
      and inflammation in the liver with P. chabaudi AS. The observed liver injury was 
      only marginally influenced by the genetic background of the host, since similar
      serum liver enzyme levels were measured in infected C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice.
      Intravenous injection of P. falciparum-derived hemozoin in malaria-free C57BL/6J 
      mice induced inflammatory gene transcription in the liver, suggesting that
      hemozoin may be involved in the pathogenesis of malaria hepatopathy by inducing
      inflammation.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism and amino acid sequence variation in Plasmodium falciparum
      GLURP R2 repeat region in Assam, India, at an interval of five years.
PG  - 450
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-450 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The R2 repeat region of GLURP has been reported as a good genetic
      marker for Plasmodium falciparum genotyping. Proper knowledge of the extent and
      nature of P. falciparum genetic diversity using highly immunogenic R2 repeat
      region in malaria-endemic areas is a crucial element to understand various
      aspects related to immunity acquisition and disease pathogenesis. METHODS:
      Population diversity of P. falciparum GLURP and amino acid sequence repeats in
      GLURP R2 region was studied in malaria-endemic Assam state, northeast India and
      compared at an interval of five years during 2005 (Group-A) and 2011 (Group-B).
      RESULTS: Of the 66 samples, a total of 55 samples showed positive PCR bands for
      GLURP R2 region and altogether ten types of alleles with size ranging from 501 bp
      to 1,050 bp (50 bp bin) were observed and coded as genotypes I-X. In Group-A (n =
      29), 24 samples were found infected with single, four with double and one with
      triple P. falciparum genotype, while in Group-B (n = 26), single genotype was
      found in 23 samples, double in two samples and triple in one sample. Genotype IV 
      showed significant increase (p = 0.002) during 2011 (Group-B). Genotypes I to V
      were more common in Group-B (62%), however genotypes VI to X were more frequently
      distributed in Group-A. The expected heterozygosity was found slightly higher in 
      Group-A (HE = 0.87) than Group-B (HE = 0.85), whereas multiplicity of infection
      (MOI) in Group-A (MOI = 1.21 +/- 0.49) and Group-B (MOI = 1.12 +/- 0.43) did not 
      display significant variation. The amino acid repeat sequence unit (AAU)
      DKNEKGQHEIVEVEEILPE (called 'a') was more frequent in the well-conserved part of 
      R2 repeat region. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first extensive study in
      India which has generated substantial data for understanding the type and
      distribution of naturally evolved genetic polymorphism at amino acid sequence
      level in GLURP R2 repeat region in P. falciparum. There was decrease in the PCR
      amplicon size as well as the number of AAU [amino acid repeat unit] in Group-B
      displaying the bottleneck effect. The present study described a new type of AAU
      'd' which varied from the other previous known AAUs.

TI  - Open-label, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial of artesunate-amodiaquine 
      versus artemether-lumefantrine fixed-dose combinations in children and adults
      with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Cote d'Ivoire.
PG  - 439
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-439 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of artemisinin resistance has raised concerns that the most
      potent anti-malarial drug may be under threat. Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are, respectively, the first- and second-line
      treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Cote d'Ivoire. Constant
      monitoring by National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) of drug efficacy is an
      important tool in establishing rational anti-malarial drug policies in Cote
      d'Ivoire. METHODS: In an open label, randomized controlled clinical trial,
      children and adults were randomized to receive AS-AQ or AL. Both drug regimens
      were given for three days, and follow-up was for 42 days. The primary endpoint
      was the 42-day cure rate and was defined as proportion of patients with
      PCR-corrected cure rate after 42 days of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 383
      patients who were attending the Anonkoua-koute (Abidjan), Petit Paris (Korhogo)
      and Libreville (Man) hospitals and presenting with symptomatic acute
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive AS-AQ (188) and AL
      (195). The intention-to-treat analysis showed effectiveness rates of 94.7% and
      96.4% for AS-AQ and AL, respectively on day 42. After adjustment for PCR, these
      rates were 96.8% and 99%, respectively. At day 42, in per-protocol analysis,
      Adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) PCR uncorrected was 97.8%
      and 97.4% for AS-AQ and AL, respectively. The PCR adjusted ACPR was 100% for each
      combination and both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
      shown the high efficacy of AS-AQ in patients of all ages with acute uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria and AS-AQ was non-inferior to AL. Continuous efficacy
      monitoring is recommended.

TI  - Safety and comparability of controlled human Plasmodium falciparum infection by
      mosquito bite in malaria-naive subjects at a new facility for sporozoite
      challenge.
PG  - e109654
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0109654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies which recapitulate 
      mosquito-borne infection are a critical tool to identify protective vaccine and
      drug candidates for advancement to field trials. In partnership with the Walter
      Reed Army Institute of Research, the CHMI model was established at the Seattle
      Biomedical Research Institute's Malaria Clinical Trials Center (MCTC). Activities
      and reagents at both centers were aligned to ensure comparability and continued
      safety of the model. To demonstrate successful implementation, CHMI was performed
      in six healthy malaria-naive volunteers. METHODS: All volunteers received NF54
      strain Plasmodium falciparum by the bite of five infected Anopheles stephensi
      mosquitoes under controlled conditions and were monitored for signs and symptoms 
      of malaria and for parasitemia by peripheral blood smear. Subjects were treated
      upon diagnosis with chloroquine by directly observed therapy. Immunological (T
      cell and antibody) and molecular diagnostic (real-time quantitative reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR]) assessments were also
      performed. RESULTS: All six volunteers developed patent parasitemia and clinical 
      malaria. No serious adverse events occurred during the study period or for six
      months post-infection. The mean prepatent period was 11.2 days (range 9-14 days),
      and geometric mean parasitemia upon diagnosis was 10.8 parasites/microL (range
      2-69) by microscopy. qRT-PCR detected parasites an average of 3.7 days (range 2-4
      days) earlier than blood smears. All volunteers developed antibodies to the
      blood-stage antigen merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1), which persisted up to
      six months. Humoral and cellular responses to pre-erythrocytic antigens
      circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and liver-stage antigen 1 (LSA-1) were limited.
      CONCLUSION: The CHMI model was safe, well tolerated and characterized by
      consistent prepatent periods, pre-symptomatic diagnosis in 3/6 subjects and
      adverse event profiles as reported at established centers. The MCTC can now
      evaluate candidates in the increasingly diverse vaccine and drug pipeline using
      the CHMI model. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01058226.

TI  - Comparison of detection methods to estimate asexual Plasmodium falciparum
      parasite prevalence and gametocyte carriage in a community survey in Tanzania.
PG  - 433

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of molecular techniques to detect malaria parasites has been 
      advocated to improve the accuracy of parasite prevalence estimates, especially in
      moderate to low endemic settings. Molecular work is time-consuming and costly,
      thus the effective gains of this technique need to be carefully evaluated. Light 
      microscopy (LM) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are commonly used to detect
      malaria infection in resource constrained areas, but their limited sensitivity
      results in underestimation of the proportion of people infected with Plasmodium
      falciparum. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of missed infections via a
      community survey in Tanzania, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P. 
      falciparum parasites and gametocytes. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty
      individuals of all ages from the Kilombero and Ulanga districts (Tanzania) were
      enrolled in a cross-sectional survey. Finger prick blood samples were collected
      for parasite detection by RDT, LM and molecular diagnosis using quantitative 18S 
      rRNA PCR and msp2 nPCR. Gametocytes were detected by LM and by amplifying
      transcripts of the gametocyte-specific marker pfs25. RESULTS: Results from all
      three diagnostic methods were available for a subset of 226 individuals.
      Prevalence of P. falciparum was 38% (86/226; 95% CI 31.9-44.4%) by qPCR, 15.9%
      (36/226; 95% CI 11.1-20.7%) by RDT and 5.8% (13/226; 95% CI 2.69- 8.81%) by LM.
      qPCR was positive for 72% (26/36) of the RDT-positive samples. Gametocyte
      prevalence was 10.6% (24/226) by pfs25-qRT-PCR and 1.2% by LM. CONCLUSIONS: LM
      showed the poorest performance, detecting only 15% of P. falciparum parasite
      carriers identified by PCR. Thus, LM is not a sufficiently accurate technique
      from which to inform policies and malaria control or elimination efforts. The
      diagnostic performance of RDT was superior to that of LM. However, it is also
      insufficient when precise prevalence data are needed for monitoring intervention 
      success or for determining point prevalence rates in countrywide surveillance.
      Detection of gametocytes by PCR was 10-times more sensitive than by LM. These
      findings support the need for molecular techniques to accurately estimate the
      human infectious reservoir and hence the transmission potential in a population.

TI  - Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum K13 propeller gene from Bangladesh
      (2009-2013).
PG  - 431
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a malaria hypo-endemic country sharing borders with
      India and Myanmar. Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) remains successful in
      Bangladesh. An increase of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites on the
      Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders is worrisome. K13 propeller gene
      (PF3D7_1343700 or PF13_0238) mutations have been linked to both in vitro
      artemisinin resistance and in vivo slow parasite clearance rates. This group
      undertook to evaluate if mutations seen in Cambodia have emerged in Bangladesh
      where ACT use is now standard for a decade. METHODS: Samples were obtained from
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria patients from Upazila health complexes
      (UHC) between 2009 and 2013 in seven endemic districts of Bangladesh. These
      districts included Khagrachari (Matiranga UHC), Rangamati (Rajasthali UHC), Cox's
      Bazar (Ramu and Ukhia UHC), Bandarban (Lama UHC), Mymensingh (Haluaghat UHC),
      Netrokona (Durgapur and Kalmakanda UHC), and Moulvibazar (Sreemangal and
      Kamalganj UHC). RESULTS: Out of 296 microscopically positive P. falciparum
      samples, 271 (91.6%) were confirmed as mono-infections by both real-time PCR and 
      nested PCR. The K13 propeller gene from 253 (93.4%) samples was sequenced
      bi-directionally. One non-synonymous mutation (A578S) was found in Bangladeshi
      clinical isolates. The A578S mutation was confirmed and lies adjacent to the
      C580Y mutation, the major mutation causing delayed parasite clearance in
      Cambodia. Based on computational modeling A578S should have a significant effect 
      on tertiary structure of the protein. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that P.
      falciparum in Bangladesh remains free of the C580Y mutation linked to delayed
      parasite clearance. However, the mutation A578S is present and based on
      structural analysis could affect K13 gene function. Further in vivo clinical
      studies are required to validate the effect of this mutation.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine on treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection in an area of high malaria transmission in
      Zambia.
PG  - 430
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance continues to be a leading threat to
      ongoing malaria control efforts and calls for continued monitoring of the
      efficacy of these drugs in order to inform national anti-malarial drug policy
      decision-making. This study assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL)(Coartem(R)) for the treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in two sentinel high malaria transmission districts
      in the Eastern Province of Zambia in persons aged six months and above, excluding
      women aged 12 to 18 years. METHODS: This was an observational cohort of 176
      symptomatic patients diagnosed with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      mono-infection. A World Health Organization (WHO)-standardized 28-day assessment 
      protocol was used to assess clinical and parasitological responses to directly
      observed AL treatment of uncomplicated malaria. DNA polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) analysis for molecular markers of AL resistance was conducted on positive
      blood samples and differentiated recrudescence from re-infections of the malaria 
      parasites. RESULTS: All patients (CI 97.6-100) had adequate clinical and
      parasitological responses to treatment with AL. At the time of enrolment, mean
      slide positivity among study participants was 71.8% and 55.2% in Katete and
      Chipata, respectively. From a mean parasite density of 55,087, 98% of the study
      participants presented with zero parasitaemia by day 3 of the study. Fever
      clearance occurred within 24 hours of treatment with AL. However mean parasite
      density declines were most dramatic in participants in the older age. No adverse 
      reactions to AL treatment were observed during the study. CONCLUSION: AL remains 
      a safe and efficacious drug for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in Zambia, endemic for malaria, with some provinces
      experiencing high transmission intensity. However, the delayed parasite clearance
      in younger patients calls for further sentinel and periodical monitoring of AL
      efficacy in different areas of the country.

TI  - High-resolution melting analysis reveals low Plasmodium parasitaemia infections
      among microscopically negative febrile patients in western Kenya.
PG  - 429
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-429 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are common tools for
      diagnosing malaria, but are deficient in detecting low Plasmodium parasitaemia. A
      novel molecular diagnostic tool (nPCR-HRM) that combines the sensitivity and
      specificity of nested PCR (nPCR) and direct PCR-high resolution melting analysis 
      (dPCR-HRM) was developed. To evaluate patterns of anti-malarial drug
      administration when no parasites are detected, nPCR-HRM was employed to screen
      blood samples for low parasitaemia from febrile patients without microscopically 
      detectable Plasmodium infections in a rural malaria-endemic setting. METHODS:
      Blood samples (n = 197) were collected in two islands of Lake Victoria, Kenya,
      from febrile patients without Plasmodium detectable by microscopy or RDTs. 18S
      rRNA gene sequences were amplified from extracted DNA by nPCR-HRM, nPCR, and
      dPCR-HRM to detect and differentiate Plasmodium parasites. The limits of
      detection (LoD) were compared using serial dilutions of the WHO International
      Standard for P. falciparum DNA. Data on administration of anti-malarials were
      collected to estimate prescription of anti-malarial drugs to patients with and
      without low parasitaemia Plasmodium infections. RESULTS: The coupled nPCR-HRM
      assay detected Plasmodium parasites with greater sensitivity (LoD = 236
      parasites/mL) than either nPCR (LoD = 4,700 parasites/mL) or dPCR-HRM (LoD =
      1,490 parasites/mL). Moreover, nPCR-HRM detected and differentiated
      low-parasitaemia infections in significantly greater proportions of patients than
      did either nPCR or dPCR-HRM (p-value <0.001). Among these low-parasitaemia
      infections, 67.7% of patients were treated with anti-malarials, whereas 81.5% of 
      patients not infected with Plasmodium parasites were treated with anti-malarials.
      CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced sensitivity of nPCR-HRM demonstrates limitations of
      differential febrile illness diagnostics in rural malaria endemic settings that
      confound epidemiological estimates of malaria, and lead to inadvertent
      misadministration of anti-malarial drugs. This is the first study that employs
      low-parasitaemia Plasmodium diagnostics to quantify the prescription of
      anti-malarial drugs to both non-malaria febrile patients and patients with
      low-parasitaemia Plasmodium infections. nPCR-HRM enhances low-parasitaemia
      malaria diagnosis and can potentially surmount the deficiencies of microscopy and
      RDT-based results in determining low-parasitaemia Plasmodium infection rates for 
      evaluating malaria elimination efforts. The findings highlight the need for
      improved differential diagnostics of febrile illness in remote malaria endemic
      regions.

      area with indistinct seasonal transitions.
PG  - 515-23
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S67252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The renewed malaria eradication efforts require an understanding of
      the seasonal patterns of frequency of polymorphic variants in order to focus
      limited funds productively. Although cross-sectional studies in holoendemic areas
      spanning a single year could be useful in describing parasite genotype status at 
      a given point, such information is inadequate in describing temporal trends in
      genotype polymorphisms. For Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Kisumu District
      Hospital, Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter gene
      (Pfcrt-K76T) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (PfMDR1-N86Y), were
      analyzed for polymorphisms and parasitemia changes in the 53 months from March
      2008 to August 2012. Observations were compared with prevailing climatic factors,
      including humidity, rainfall, and temperature. METHODS: Parasitemia (the
      percentage of infected red blood cells per total red blood cells) was established
      by microscopy for P. falciparum malaria-positive samples. P. falciparum DNA was
      extracted from whole blood using a Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. Single nucleotide
      polymorphism identification at positions Pfcrt-K76T and PfMDR1-N86Y was performed
      using real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or sequencing. Data on climatic
      variables were obtained from http://www.tutiempo.net/en/. RESULTS: A total of 895
      field isolates from 2008 (n=169), 2009 (n=161), 2010 (n=216), 2011 (n=223), and
      2012 (n=126) showed large variations in monthly frequency of PfMDR1-N86Y and
      Pfcrt-K76T as the mutant genotypes decreased from 68.4%+/-15% and 38.1%+/-13% to 
      29.8%+/-18% and 13.3%+/-9%, respectively. The mean percentage of parasitemia was 
      2.61%+/-1.01% (coefficient of variation 115.86%; n=895). There was no correlation
      between genotype or parasitemia and climatic factors. CONCLUSION: This study
      shows variability in the frequency of Pfcrt-K76T and PfMDR1-N86Y polymorphisms
      during the study period, bringing into focus the role of cross-sectional studies 
      in describing temporal genotype trends. The lack of correlation between genotypes
      and climatic changes, especially precipitation, emphasizes the cost of investment
      in genotype change.

TI  - Host candidate gene polymorphisms and associated clearance of P. falciparum
      amodiaquine and fansidar resistance mutants in children less than 5 years in
      Cameroon.
PG  - 323-33
LID - 10.1179/2047773214Y.0000000159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this post-hoc analysis, we determined the influence of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms in host candidate immune genes on the outcome of drug
      resistant malaria in Cameroon. METHODS: Human DNA from 760 patients from a
      previous clinical trial was subjected to mass spectrometry-based single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Allele frequencies of candidate immune 
      genes were calculated for 62 SNPs on 17 human chromosomes for their possible
      involvement in clearance of drug-resistant parasites with the triple mutations of
      pfcrt76T, pfmdr86Y, and pfmdr1246Y (TY) and pfdhfr51I, pfdhfr59R, pfdhfr108N, and
      pfdhps437G (IRNG) which were determined by dotblot or PCR-restriction analysis.
      Differences in SNP frequencies and association analysis were carried out by
      comparing Chi-square odds ratios (ORs) and stratified by Mantel-Haenzel
      statistics. An adjusted P value (OR) <0.0008 was considered significant. RESULTS:
      Post-treatment drug failure rates were amodiaquine (36.4%);
      sulpadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine combination (15.4%); and
      sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (18.1%). SNPs in IL22, IL-4R1, and CD36 appeared to
      have been associated with clearance of resistant parasites [p = 0.017, OR (C
      allele):1.44, 95% CI (OR): 1.06-1.95]; [P = 0.014, OR = 1.31, 95% CI (OR):
      1.07-1.83]; [P = 5.78x10(-5), OR = 0.27, 95%CI (OR): 0.13-0.54], respectively,
      with high fever (>39 degrees C for 48 hours) [IL-22, P = 0.01, OR = 1.5, 95% CI
      (OR): 1.8-2.1] and also in high frequency among the Fulani participants [P =
      0.006, OR = 1.83, 95% CI (OR): 1.11-3.08)]. The CD36-1264 null allele was
      completely absent in the northern population. CONCLUSION: Independent association
      of SNPs in IL22 and IL-4 with clearance of amodiaquine- and
      sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine-resistant parasites did not reach statistical
      significance, but may suggest that not all drug-resistant mutants are adversely
      affected by the same immune-mediated mechanisms of clearance.

AB  - In this study, three molecular assays (real-time multiplex polymerase chain
      reaction [PCR], merozoite surface antigen gene [MSP]-multiplex PCR, and the
      PlasmoNex Multiplex PCR Kit) have been developed for diagnosis of Plasmodium
      species. In total, 52 microscopy-positive and 20 malaria-negative samples were
      used in this study. We found that real-time multiplex PCR was the most sensitive 
      for detecting P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. The MSP-multiplex PCR assay and the 
      PlasmoNex Multiplex PCR Kit were equally sensitive for diagnosing P. knowlesi
      infection, whereas the PlasmoNex Multiplex PCR Kit and real-time multiplex PCR
      showed similar sensitivity for detecting P. vivax. The three molecular assays
      displayed 100% specificity for detecting malaria samples. We observed no
      significant differences between MSP-multiplex PCR and the PlasmoNex multiplex PCR
      kit (McNemar's test: P = 0.1489). However, significant differences were observed 
      comparing real-time multiplex PCR with the PlasmoNex Multiplex PCR Kit (McNemar's
      test: P = 0.0044) or real-time multiplex PCR with MSP-multiplex PCR (McNemar's
      test: P = 0.0012).

TI  - Genotyping of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum in wild caught
      Anopheles minimus mosquitoes in a malaria endemic area of Assam, India.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - We validated the feasibility of using Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria
      parasite, DNA present in wild caught vector mosquitoes for the characterization
      of chloroquine resistance status. House frequenting mosquitoes belonging to
      Anopheles minimus complex were collected from human dwellings in a malaria
      endemic area of Assam, Northeast India and DNA was extracted from the head-thorax
      region of individual mosquitoes. Anopheles minimus complex mosquitoes were
      identified to species level and screened for the presence of Plasmodium sp. using
      molecular tools. Nested PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping of P. falciparum 
      based on K76T mutation in the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene.
      Three of the 27 wild caught An. minimus mosquitoes were harbouring P. falciparum 
      sporozoites (positivity 11.1%) and all 3 were had 76T mutation in the pfcrt gene,
      indicating chloroquine resistance. The approach of characterizing antimalarial
      resistance of malaria parasite in vector mosquitoes can potentially be used as a 
      surveillance tool for monitoring transmission of antimalarial drug resistant
      parasite strains in the community.

TI  - Immune characterization of Plasmodium falciparum parasites with a shared genetic 
      signature in a region of decreasing transmission.
PG  - 276-85
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01979-14 [doi]
AB  - As the intensity of malaria transmission has declined, Plasmodium falciparum
      parasite populations have displayed decreased clonal diversity resulting from the
      emergence of many parasites with common genetic signatures (CGS). We have
      monitored such CGS parasite clusters from 2006 to 2013 in Thies, Senegal, using
      the molecular barcode. The first, and one of the largest observed clusters of CGS
      parasites, was present in 24% of clinical isolates in 2008, declined to 3.4% of
      clinical isolates in 2009, and then disappeared. To begin to explore the
      relationship between the immune responses of the population and the emergence and
      decline of specific parasite genotypes, we have determined whether antibodies to 
      CGS parasites correlate with their prevalence. We measured (i) antibodies capable
      of inhibiting parasite growth in culture and (ii) antibodies recognizing the
      surfaces of infected erythrocytes (RBCs). IgG obtained from volunteers in 2009
      showed increased reactivity to the surfaces of CGS-parasitized erythrocytes over 
      IgG from 2008. Since P. falciparum EMP-1 (PfEMP-1) is a major variant surface
      antigen, we used var Ups quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and
      sequencing with degenerate DBL1alpha domain primers to characterize the var genes
      expressed by CGS parasites after short-term in vitro culture. CGS parasites show 
      upregulation of UpsA var genes and 2-cysteine-containing PfEMP-1 molecules and
      express the same dominant var transcript. Our work indicates that the CGS
      parasites in this cluster express similar var genes, more than would be expected 
      by chance in the population, and that there is year-to-year variation in immune
      recognition of surface antigens on CGS parasite-infected erythrocytes. This study
      lays the groundwork for detailed investigations of the mechanisms driving the
      expansion or contraction of specific parasite clones in the population.

TI  - Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children in Zaire and Uige Provinces,
      angola.
PG  - 437-43
LID - 10.1128/AAC.04181-14 [doi]
AB  - The development of resistance to antimalarials is a major challenge for global
      malaria control. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, the newest class of
      antimalarials, are used worldwide but there have been reports of artemisinin
      resistance in Southeast Asia. In February through May 2013, we conducted
      open-label, nonrandomized therapeutic efficacy studies of artemether-lumefantrine
      (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in Zaire and Uige Provinces in
      northern Angola. The parasitological and clinical responses to treatment in
      children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection were measured
      over 28 days, and the main outcome was a PCR-corrected adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR) proportion on day 28. Parasites from treatment
      failures were analyzed for the presence of putative molecular markers of
      resistance to lumefantrine and artemisinins, including the recently identified
      mutations in the K13 propeller gene. In the 320 children finishing the study, 25 
      treatment failures were observed: 24 in the AL arms and 1 in the DP arm. The
      PCR-corrected ACPR proportions on day 28 for AL were 88% (95% confidence interval
      [CI], 78 to 95%) in Zaire and 97% (91 to 100%) in Uige. For DP, the proportions
      were 100% (95 to 100%) in Zaire, and 100% (96 to 100%) in Uige. None of the
      treatment failures had molecular evidence of artemisinin resistance. In contrast,
      91% of AL late-treatment failures had markers associated with lumefantrine
      resistance on the day of failure. The absence of molecular markers for
      artemisinin resistance and the observed efficacies of both drug combinations
      suggest no evidence of artemisinin resistance in northern Angola. There is
      evidence of increased lumefantrine resistance in Zaire, which should continue to 
      be monitored.

      primer extension and lateral flow immunoassay.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1128/AAC.03395-14 [doi]
AB  - The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to some antimalarial drugs is linked to
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Currently, there are no methods for the
      identification of resistant parasites that are sufficiently simple, cheap, and
      fast enough to be performed at point-of-care, i.e., in local hospitals where
      drugs are prescribed. Primer extension methods (PEXT) were developed to identify 
      4 SNPs in P. falciparum positioned at amino acids 86, 184, and 1246 of the P.
      falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene (pfmdr1) and amino acid 76 of the
      chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt). The PEXT products were
      visualized by a nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (NALFIA) with carbon
      nanoparticles as the detection labels. PCR-PEXT-NALFIAs showed good correlation
      to the reference methods, quantitative PCR (qPCR) or direct amplicon sequence
      analysis, in an initial open-label evaluation with 17 field samples. The tests
      were further evaluated in a blind study design in a set of 150 patient isolates. 
      High specificities of 98 to 100% were found for all 4 PCR-PEXT genotyping assays.
      The sensitivities ranged from 75% to 100% when all PEXT-positive tests were
      considered. A number of samples with a low parasite density were successfully
      characterized by the reference methods but failed to generate a result in the
      PCR-PEXT-NALFIA, particularly those samples with microscopy-negative subpatent
      infections. This proof-of principle study validates the use of PCR-PEXT-NALFIA
      for the detection of resistance-associated mutations in P. falciparum,
      particularly for microscopy-positive infections. Although it requires a standard 
      thermal cycler, the procedure is cheap and rapid and thus a potentially valuable 
      tool for point-of-care detection in developing countries.

TI  - Cytochrome P450 single nucleotide polymorphisms in an indigenous Tanzanian
      population: a concern about the metabolism of artemisinin-based combinations.
PG  - 420
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combinations currently recommended for treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many countries of sub-Saharan
      Africa are substrates of CYP enzymes. The cytochrome enzyme system is responsible
      for metabolism of about 80-90% of clinically used drugs. It is, therefore,
      important to obtain the pharmacogenetics of the population in the region with
      respect to these combinations and thereby enable practitioners to predict
      treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to detect and determine allelic
      frequencies of CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2B6*6 variant
      alleles in a Tanzanian indigenous population. METHODS: Genomic DNA extraction
      from blood obtained from 256 participants who escorted patients at Karume Health 
      Centre in Mwanza Tanzania, was carried out using the Gene JET Genomic DNA
      purification kit (Thermo Scientific). Genotyping for the cytochrome P450 variant 
      alleles was performed using predesigned primers. Amplification was done by PCR
      while differentiation between alleles was done by restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) (for CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3) and sequencing (for CYP2B6*6,
      CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A4*1B). RESULTS: CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B and
      CYP2B6*6 variant allelic frequencies were found to be 19,10,16,78 and 36%
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of CYP2C8*2, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B and
      CYP2B6*6 mutations in a Tanzanian population/subjects are common. The impact of
      these point mutations on the metabolism of anti-malarial drugs, particularly
      artemisinin-based combinations, and their potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs)
      needs to be further evaluated.

TI  - Evaluation of the accuracy of the EasyTest malaria Pf/Pan Ag, a rapid diagnostic 
      test, in Uganda.
PG  - 501-5
LID - 10.3347/kjp.2014.52.5.501 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been widely used for malaria 
      detection, primarily because of their simple operation, fast results, and
      straightforward interpretation. The Asan EasyTest Malaria Pf/Pan Ag is one of the
      most commonly used malaria RDTs in several countries, including Korea and India. 
      In this study, we tested the diagnostic performance of this RDT in Uganda to
      evaluate its usefulness for field diagnosis of malaria in this country.
      Microscopic and PCR analyses, and the Asan EasyTest Malaria Pf/Pan Ag rapid
      diagnostic test, were performed on blood samples from 185 individuals with
      suspected malaria in several villages in Uganda. Compared to the microscopic
      analysis, the sensitivity of the RDT to detect malaria infection was 95.8% and
      83.3% for Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum, respectively. Although the
      diagnostic sensitivity of the RDT decreased when parasitemia was </=500
      parasites/microl, it showed 96.8% sensitivity (98.4% for P. falciparum and 93.8% 
      for non-P. falciparum) in blood samples with parasitemia >/=100 parasites/microl.
      The specificity of the RDT was 97.3% for P. falciparum and 97.3% for non-P.
      falciparum. These results collectively suggest that the accuracy of the Asan
      EasyTest Malaria Pf/Pan Ag makes it an effective point-of-care diagnostic tool
      for malaria in Uganda.

      multidrug resistant malaria parasites in anopheles vectors.

AB  - The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) malaria caused by
      Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax have become increasingly important in
      the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). MDR malaria is the heritable and hypermutable
      property of human malarial parasite populations that can decrease in vitro and in
      vivo susceptibility to proven antimalarial drugs as they exhibit dose-dependent
      drug resistance and delayed parasite clearance time in treated patients. MDR
      malaria risk situations reflect consequences of the national policy and strategy 
      as this influences the ongoing national-level or subnational-level implementation
      of malaria control strategies in endemic GMS countries. Based on our experience
      along with current literature review, the design of ecotope-based entomological
      surveillance (EES) and molecular xenomonitoring of MDR falciparum and vivax
      malaria parasites in Anopheles vectors is proposed to monitor infection pockets
      in transmission control areas of forest and forest fringe-related malaria, so as 
      to bridge malaria landscape ecology (ecotope and ecotone) and epidemiology.
      Malaria ecotope and ecotone are confined to a malaria transmission area
      geographically associated with the infestation of Anopheles vectors and
      particular environments to which human activities are related. This enables the
      EES to encompass mosquito collection and identification, salivary gland DNA
      extraction, Plasmodium- and species-specific identification, molecular
      marker-based PCR detection methods for putative drug resistance genes, and data
      management. The EES establishes strong evidence of Anopheles vectors carrying MDR
      P. vivax in infection pockets epidemiologically linked with other data obtained
      during which a course of follow-up treatment of the notified P. vivax patients
      receiving the first-line treatment was conducted. For regional and global
      perspectives, the EES would augment the epidemiological surveillance and
      monitoring of MDR falciparum and vivax malaria parasites in hotspots or suspected
      areas established in most endemic GMS countries implementing the National Malaria
      Control Programs, in addition to what is guided by the World Health Organization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Drug resistance against Plasmodium falciparum has been recognized as
      the crucial obstacle to curbing mortality and morbidity from malaria. To
      investigate the distribution and pattern of multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) gene 
      polymorphisms in P. falciparum, isolates collected from the malaria high-endemic 
      Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 217
      patients with P. falciparum malaria during rainy season in 2012 on Bioko Island. 
      These samples were extracted using Chelex to obtain parasite DNA. Nest-polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were employed to detect mutations (N86Y,
      E130K, Y184F, S1034C, N1042D, V1109I, and D1246Y) and haplotypes in pfmdr1 gene. 
      RESULTS: A total of 151 samples were successfully detected for pfmdr1 mutations
      from the 217 patients. Pfmdr1 mutations were found in 91.39% (138/151) P.
      falciparum isolates. However, no mutation at 130 and 1109 was identified from
      these samples. Four haplotypes coding 86, 184, 1034, 1,042, and 1,246 were found 
      including NYSND, YYSND, NFSND, and YFSND, which accounted for 8.61% (13/151),
      2.65% (4/151), 29.80% (45/151), and 58.94% (89/151), respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our results exhibited hypersensitivity to lumefantrine (LU) and mefloquine (MQ)
      and resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) in P. falciparum isolates
      from Bioko Island. This information will be useful for anti-malarial drug policy 
      in Equatorial Guinea.

TI  - [Large trophozoites in blood smear of falciparum malaria: one case report].
PG  - 355-6
AB  - This paper reports one case of atypical falciparum malaria imported from Africa, 
      whose blood smear contains many large trophozoites, with punctiform or massive
      brown pigment granules, the body shape of the plasmodium is similar to that of
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. After the gene detection by PCR, the case 
      was diagnosed as falciparum malaria. As large trophozoites were rarely seen in
      the peripheral blood of non-severe falciparum malaria cases, much attention
      should be paid to the identification of Plasmodium falciparum and other plasmodia
      in microscopic examinations.

      falciparum malaria.
PG  - 1128-33
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu590 [doi]
AB  - In malaria-endemic areas, Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia is common in
      apparently healthy children and severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in
      patients with incidental parasitemia. We assessed whether the plasma Plasmodium
      falciparum DNA concentration is a useful datum for distinguishing uncomplicated
      from severe malaria in African children and Asian adults. P. falciparum DNA
      concentrations were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 224 
      African children (111 with uncomplicated malaria and 113 with severe malaria) and
      211 Asian adults (100 with uncomplicated malaria and 111 with severe malaria)
      presenting with acute falciparum malaria. The diagnostic accuracy of plasma P.
      falciparum DNA concentrations in identifying severe malaria was 0.834 for
      children and 0.788 for adults, similar to that of plasma P. falciparum HRP2
      levels and substantially superior to that of parasite densities (P < .0001). The 
      diagnostic accuracy of plasma P. falciparum DNA concentrations plus plasma P.
      falciparum HRP2 concentrations was significantly greater than that of plasma P.
      falciparum HRP2 concentrations alone (0.904 for children [P = .004] and 0.847 for
      adults [P = .003]). Quantitative real-time PCR measurement of parasite DNA in
      plasma is a useful method for diagnosing severe falciparum malaria on fresh or
      archived plasma samples.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of ChAd63-MVA vectored vaccines expressing
      circumsporozoite protein and ME-TRAP against controlled human malaria infection
      in malaria-naive individuals.
PG  - 1076-86
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circumsporozoite protein (CS) is the antigenic target for RTS,S, the 
      most advanced malaria vaccine to date. Heterologous prime-boost with the viral
      vectors simian adenovirus 63 (ChAd63)-modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is the
      most potent inducer of T-cells in humans, demonstrating significant efficacy when
      expressing the preerythrocytic antigen insert multiple
      epitope-thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP). We hypothesized that
      ChAd63-MVA containing CS may result in a significant clinical protective
      efficacy. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, 2-site, partially randomized
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study 
      to compare the clinical efficacy of ChAd63-MVA CS with ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP.
      RESULTS: One of 15 vaccinees (7%) receiving ChAd63-MVA CS and 2 of 15 (13%)
      receiving ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP achieved sterile protection after CHMI. Three of 15 
      vaccinees (20%) receiving ChAd63-MVA CS and 5 of 15 (33%) receiving ChAd63-MVA
      ME-TRAP demonstrated a delay in time to treatment, compared with unvaccinated
      controls. In quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, ChAd63-MVA CS was
      estimated to reduce the liver parasite burden by 69%-79%, compared with 79%-84%
      for ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP. CONCLUSIONS: ChAd63-MVA CS does reduce the liver parasite
      burden, but ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP remains the most promising antigenic insert for a 
      vectored liver-stage vaccine. Detailed analyses of parasite kinetics may allow
      detection of smaller but biologically important differences in vaccine efficacy
      that can influence future vaccine development. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION:

TI  - High levels of asymptomatic and subpatent Plasmodium falciparum parasite carriage
      at health facilities in an area of heterogeneous malaria transmission intensity
      in the Kenyan highlands.

AB  - In endemic settings, health facility surveys provide a convenient approach to
      estimating malaria transmission intensity. Typically, testing for malaria at
      facilities is performed on symptomatic attendees, but asymptomatic infections
      comprise a considerable proportion of the parasite reservoir. We sampled
      individuals attending five health facilities in the western Kenyan highlands.
      Malaria prevalence by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 8.6-32.9% in the health
      facilities. Of all polymerase chain reaction-positive participants, 46.4% (95%
      confidence interval [95% CI] = 42.6-50.2%) of participants had infections that
      were RDT-negative and asymptomatic, and 55.9% of those infections consisted of
      multiple parasite clones as assessed by merozoite surface protein-2 genotyping.
      Subpatent infections were more common in individuals reporting the use of
      non-artemisinin-based antimalarials in the 2 weeks preceding the survey (odds
      ratio = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.04-5.92) compared with individuals not reporting
      previous use of antimalarials. We observed a large and genetically complex pool
      of subpatent parasitemia in the Kenya highlands that must be considered in
      malaria interventions.

TI  - Prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminthiasis, prevalence of malaria
      and nutritional status of school going children in honduras.
PG  - e3248
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many small studies have been done in Honduras estimating
      soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence but a country-wide study was last
      done in 2005. The country has the highest burden of malaria among all Central
      American countries. The present study was done to estimate country-wide STH
      prevalence and intensity, malaria prevalence and nutritional status in school
      going children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional study was conducted
      following PAHO/WHO guidelines to select a sample of school going children of 3rd 
      to 5th grades, representative of ecological regions in the country. A survey
      questionnaire was filled; anthropometric measurements, stool sample for STH and
      blood sample for malaria were taken. Kato-Katz method was used for STH prevalence
      and intensity and rapid diagnostic tests, microscopy, and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) were used for malaria parasite detection. A total of 2554 students
      were studied of which 43.5% had one or more STH. Trichuriasis was the most
      prevalent (34%) followed by ascariasis (22.3%) and hookworm (0.9%). Ecological
      regions II (59.7%) and VI (55.6%) in the north had the highest STH prevalence
      rates while IV had the lowest (10.6%). Prevalence of one or more high intensity
      STH was low (1.6%). Plasmodium vivax was detected by PCR in only 5 students
      (0.2%), all of which belonged to the same municipality; no P. falciparum
      infection was detected. The majority of children (83%) had normal body mass index
      for their respective age but a significant proportion were overweight (10.42%)
      and obese (4.35%). CONCLUSIONS: Biannual deworming campaigns would be necessary
      in ecological regions II and VI, where STH prevalence is >50%. High prevalence of
      obesity in school going children is a worrying trend and portends of future
      increase in obesity related diseases. Malaria prevalence, both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic, was low and provides evidence for Honduras to embark on elimination
      of the disease.

TI  - Co-infections of malaria and geohelminthiasis in two rural communities of
      Nkassomo and Vian in the Mfou health district, Cameroon.
PG  - e3236
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human co-infection with malaria and helmimths is ubiquitous
      throughout Africa. Nevertheless, its public health significance on malaria
      severity remains poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To contribute
      to a better understanding of epidemiology and control of this co-infection in
      Cameroon, a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the prevalence of
      concomitant intestinal geohelminthiasis and malaria, and to evaluate its
      association with malaria and anaemia in Nkassomo and Vian. Finger prick blood
      specimens from a total of 263 participants aged 1-95 years were collected for
      malaria microscopy, assessment of haemoglobin levels, and molecular
      identification of Plasmodium species by PCR. Fresh stool specimens were also
      collected for the identification and quantification of geohelminths by the
      Kato-Katz method. The prevalence of malaria, geohelminths, and co-infections were
      77.2%, 28.6%, and 22.1%, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria
      parasite species identified with mean parasite density of 111 (40; 18,800)
      parasites/microl of blood. The geohelminths found were Ascaris lumbricoides
      (21.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (10.8%), with mean parasite densities of 243 (24;
      3,552) and 36 (24; 96) eggs/gram of faeces, respectively. Co-infections of A.
      lumbricoides and P. falciparum were the most frequent and correlated positively. 
      While no significant difference was observed on the prevalences of single and
      co-infections between the two localities, there was a significant difference in
      the density of A. lumbricoides infection between the two localities. The overall 
      prevalence of anaemia was 42%, with individuals co-infected with T. trichiura and
      P. falciparum (60%) being the most at risk. While the prevalence of malaria and
      anaemia were inversely related to age, children aged 5-14 years were more
      susceptible to geohelminthiasis and their co-infections with malaria.
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Co-existence of geohelminths and malaria parasites in
      Nkassomo and Vian enhances the occurrence of co-infections, and consequently,
      increases the risk for anaemia.

PG  - 833-40
LID - 10.1038/nrmicro3364 [doi]
AB  - Most Plasmodium falciparum infections that are detected in community surveys are 
      characterized by low-density parasitaemia and the absence of clinical symptoms.
      Molecular diagnostics have shown that this asymptomatic parasitic reservoir is
      more widespread than previously thought, even in low-endemic areas. In this
      Opinion article, we describe the detectability of asymptomatic malaria infections
      and the relevance of submicroscopic infections for parasite transmission to
      mosquitoes and for community interventions that aim at reducing transmission. We 
      argue that wider deployment of molecular diagnostic tools is needed to provide
      adequate insight into the epidemiology of malaria and infection dynamics to aid
      elimination efforts.

TI  - Detection of mixed infection level of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax 
      by SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR in North Gondar, north-west Ethiopia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is caused by five Plasmodium species and transmitted by
      anopheline mosquitoes. It occurs in single and mixed infections. Mixed infection 
      easily leads to misdiagnosis. Accurate detection of malaria species is vital.
      Therefore, the study was conducted to determine the level of mixed infection and 
      misdiagnosis of malaria species in the study area using SYBR Green I-based real
      time PCR. METHODS: The study was conducted in seven health centres from North
      Gondar, north-west Ethiopia. The data of all febrile patients, who attended the
      outpatient department for malaria diagnosis, from October to December 2013, was
      recorded. Dried blood spots were prepared from 168 positive samples for molecular
      re-evaluation. Parasite DNA was extracted using a commercial kit and Plasmodium
      species were re-evaluated with SYBR Green I-based real time PCR to detect mixed
      infections and misdiagnosed mono-infections. RESULTS: Among 7343 patients who
      were diagnosed for malaria in six study sites within the second quarter of the
      Ethiopian fiscal year (2013) 1802 (24.54%) were positive for malaria parasite.
      Out of this, 1,216 (67.48%) Plasmodium falciparum, 553 (30.68%) Plasmodium vivax 
      and 33 (1.8%) mixed infections of both species were recorded. The result showed
      high prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax, but very low prevalence of mixed
      infections. Among 168 samples collected on dried blood spot 7 (4.17%) were P.
      vivax, 158 (94.05%) were P. falciparum and 3 (1.80%) were mixed infections of
      both species. After re-evaluation 10 (5.95%) P. vivax, 112 (66.67%) P.
      falciparum, 21 (12.50%) P. falciparum + P. vivax mixed infection, and 17 (10.12%)
      Plasmodium ovale positive rate was recorded. The re-evaluation showed high level 
      of mixed infection, and misdiagnosis of P. ovale and P. vivax. CONCLUSIONS: The
      result shows that P. falciparum prevalence is higher than P. vivax in the study
      area. The results, obtained from SYBR Green I-based real time PCR, indicated that
      the diagnosis efficiency of microscopy is very low for species-specific and mixed
      infection detection. Therefore, real time PCR-based species diagnosis should be
      applied for clinical diagnosis and quality control purposes in order to prevent
      the advent of drug resistant strains due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess the clinical significance of
      conventional and PCR-based molecular diagnosis in patients with imported malaria 
      in Serbia. METHODS: Giemsa microscopy, the rapid diagnostic test, and
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to detect Plasmodium species in 109
      whole-blood samples from patients after their return from malaria endemic areas, 
      including those clinically suspected for malaria (n=97) and healthy travelers
      (n=12) examined as part of epidemiological surveillance. RESULTS: A total of 45
      patients were diagnosed with malaria: 42 (93.3%) by microscopy and three (6.7%)
      additional ones by qPCR. The agreement between the results of species-specific
      qPCR and microscopy was 73.3%; it was as high as 90.6% for Plasmodium falciparum 
      infections. Follow-up analysis demonstrated persistence of Plasmodium sp DNA for 
      a mean 6 days after the disappearance of parasitemia on microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Due to its sensitivity and specificity, qPCR is a helpful method complementary to
      microscopy, particularly in cases of low parasitemia. In addition, it is superior
      to microscopy for species identification.

TI  - Plasmodium knowlesi malaria during pregnancy.
PG  - 1104-10
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu562 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is the commonest cause of malaria in Malaysia,
      but little is known regarding infection during pregnancy. METHODS: To investigate
      comparative risk and consequences of knowlesi malaria during pregnancy, we
      reviewed (1) Sabah Health Department malaria-notification records created during 
      2012-2013, (2) prospectively collected data from all females with polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed malaria who were admitted to a Sabah tertiary care
      referral hospital during 2011-2014, and (3) malaria microscopy and clinical data 
      recorded at a Sabah tertiary care women and children's hospital during 2010-2014.
      RESULTS: During 2012-2013, 774 females with microscopy-diagnosed malaria were
      notified, including 252 (33%), 172 (20%), 333 (43%), and 17 (2%) with Plasmodium 
      falciparum infection, Plasmodium vivax infection, Plasmodium malariae/Plasmodium 
      knowlesi infection, and mixed infection, respectively. Among females aged 15-45
      years, pregnancy was reported in 18 of 124 (14.5%), 9 of 93 (9.7%), and 4 of 151 
      (2.6%) P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae/P. knowlesi notifications
      respectively (P = .002). Three females with knowlesi malaria were confirmed as
      pregnant: 2 had moderate anemia, and 1 delivered a preterm low-birth-weight
      infant. There were 17, 7, and 0 pregnant women with falciparum, vivax, and
      knowlesi malaria, respectively, identified from the 2 referral hospitals.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although P. knowlesi is the commonest malaria species among females 
      in Sabah, P. knowlesi infection is relatively rare during pregnancy. It may
      however be associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Plasmodium prevalence and artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria in Preah
      Vihear Province, Cambodia: a cross-sectional population-based study.
PG  - 394
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensified efforts are urgently needed to contain and eliminate
      artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong subregion.
      Medecins Sans Frontieres plans to support the Ministry of Health in eliminating
      P. falciparum in an area with artemisinin resistance in the north-east of
      Cambodia. As a first step, the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. and the presence of 
      mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were evaluated in two districts 
      of Preah Vihear Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study using
      a two-stage cluster sampling was conducted in the rural districts of Chhaeb and
      Chey Saen, from September to October 2013. In each district, 30 clusters of 10
      households were randomly selected. In total, blood samples were collected for
      1,275 participants in Chhaeb and 1,224 in Chey Saen. Prevalence of Plasmodium
      spp. was assessed by PCR on dried blood spots. Plasmodium falciparum positive
      samples were screened for mutations in the K13-propeller domain gene
      (PF3D7_1343700). RESULT: The prevalence of Plasmodium spp. was estimated at 1.49%
      (95% CI 0.71-3.11%) in Chhaeb and 2.61% (95% CI 1.45-4.66%) in Chey Saen.
      Twenty-seven samples were positive for P. falciparum, giving a prevalence of
      0.16% (95% CI 0.04-0.65) in Chhaeb and 2.04% (95% CI 1.04-3.99%) in Chey Saen.
      Only 4.0% of the participants testing positive presented with fever or history of
      fever. K13-propeller domain mutant type alleles (C580Y and Y493H) were found,
      only in Chey Saen district, in seven out of 11 P. falciparum positive samples
      with enough genetic material to allow testing. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence
      of P. falciparum was low in both districts but parasites presenting mutations in 
      the K13-propeller domain gene, strongly associated with artemisinin-resistance,
      are circulating in Chey Saen.The prevalence might be underestimated because of
      the absentees - mainly forest workers - and the workers of private companies who 
      were not included in the study. These results confirm the need to urgently
      develop and implement targeted interventions to contain and eliminate P.
      falciparum malaria in this district before it spreads to other areas.

PG  - 393
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As public health efforts seek to eradicate malaria, there has been an
      emphasis on eliminating low-density parasite reservoirs in asymptomatic carriers.
      As such, diagnosing submicroscopic Plasmodium infections using PCR-based
      techniques has become important not only in clinical trials of malaria vaccines
      and therapeutics, but also in active malaria surveillance campaigns. However,
      PCR-based quantitative assays that rely on nucleic acid extracted from dried
      blood spots (DBS) have demonstrated lower sensitivity than assays that use
      cryopreserved whole blood as source material. METHODS: The density of Plasmodium 
      falciparum asexual parasites was quantified using genomic DNA extracted from
      dried blood spots (DBS) and the sensitivity of two approaches was compared:
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the P. falciparum 18S ribosomal RNA
      gene, either with an initial conventional PCR amplification prior to qPCR (nested
      qPCR), or without an initial amplification (qPCR only). Parasite densities
      determined by nested qPCR, qPCR only, and light microscopy were compared.
      RESULTS: Nested qPCR results in 10-fold higher sensitivity (0.5 parasites/mul)
      when compared to qPCR only (five parasites/ul). Among microscopy-positive
      samples, parasite densities calculated by nested qPCR correlated strongly with
      microscopy for both asymptomatic (Pearson's r=0.58, P<0.001) and symptomatic
      (Pearson's r=0.70, P<0.0001) P. falciparum infections. CONCLUSION: Nested qPCR
      improves the sensitivity for the detection of P. falciparum blood-stage infection
      from clinical DBS samples. This approach may be useful for active malaria
      surveillance in areas where submicroscopic asymptomatic infections are prevalent.

TI  - Changing epidemiology of malaria in Sabah, Malaysia: increasing incidence of
      Plasmodium knowlesi.
PG  - 390
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While Malaysia has had great success in controlling Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, notifications of Plasmodium malariae and the
      microscopically near-identical Plasmodium knowlesi increased substantially over
      the past decade. However, whether this represents microscopic misdiagnosis or
      increased recognition of P. knowlesi has remained uncertain. METHODS: To describe
      the changing epidemiology of malaria in Sabah, in particular the increasing
      incidence of P. knowlesi, a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken
      involving a review of Department of Health malaria notification data from
      2012-2013, extending a previous review of these data from 1992-2011. In addition,
      malaria PCR and microscopy data from the State Public Health Laboratory were
      reviewed to estimate the accuracy of the microscopy-based notification data.
      RESULTS: Notifications of P. malariae/P. knowlesi increased from 703 in 2011 to
      815 in 2012 and 996 in 2013. Notifications of P. vivax and P. falciparum
      decreased from 605 and 628, respectively, in 2011, to 297 and 263 in 2013. In
      2013, P. malariae/P. knowlesi accounted for 62% of all malaria notifications
      compared to 35% in 2011. Among 1,082 P. malariae/P. knowlesi blood slides
      referred for PCR testing during 2011-2013, there were 924 (85%) P. knowlesi
      mono-infections, 30 (2.8%) P. falciparum, 43 (4.0%) P. vivax, seven (0.6%) P.
      malariae, six (0.6%) mixed infections, 31 (2.9%) positive only for Plasmodium
      genus, and 41 (3.8%) Plasmodium-negative. Plasmodium knowlesi mono-infection
      accounted for 32/156 (21%) and 33/87 (38%) blood slides diagnosed by microscopy
      as P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Twenty-six malaria deaths were
      reported during 2010-2013, including 12 with 'P. malariae/P. knowlesi' (all
      adults), 12 with P. falciparum (seven adults), and two adults with P. vivax.
      CONCLUSIONS: Notifications of P. malariae/P. knowlesi in Sabah are increasing,
      with this trend likely reflecting a true increase in incidence of P. knowlesi and
      presenting a major threat to malaria control and elimination in Malaysia. With
      the decline of P. falciparum and P. vivax, control programmes need to incorporate
      measures to protect against P. knowlesi, with further research required to
      determine effective interventions.

TI  - Spatial clustering and risk factors of malaria infections in Ratanakiri Province,
      Cambodia.
PG  - 387
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria incidence worldwide has steadily declined over the past
      decades. Consequently, increasingly more countries will proceed from control to
      elimination. The malaria distribution in low incidence settings appears patchy,
      and local transmission hotspots are a continuous source of infection. In this
      study, species-specific clusters and associated risk factors were identified
      based on malaria prevalence data collected in the north-east of Cambodia. In
      addition, Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity, population structure and gene 
      flows were studied. METHOD: In 2012, blood samples from 5793 randomly selected
      individuals living in 117 villages were collected from Ratanakiri province,
      Cambodia. Malariometric data of each participant were simultaneously accumulated 
      using a standard questionnaire. A two-step PCR allowed for species-specific
      detection of malaria parasites, and SNP-genotyping of P. falciparum was
      performed. SaTScan was used to determine species-specific areas of elevated risk 
      to infection, and univariate and multivariate risk analyses were carried out.
      RESULT: PCR diagnosis found 368 positive individuals (6.4%) for malaria
      parasites, of which 22% contained mixed species infections. The occurrence of
      these co-infections was more frequent than expected. Specific areas with elevated
      risk of infection were detected for all Plasmodium species. The clusters for
      Falciparum, Vivax and Ovale malaria appeared in the north of the province along
      the main river, while the cluster for Malariae malaria was situated elsewhere.
      The relative risk to be a malaria parasite carrier within clusters along the
      river was twice that outside the area. The main risk factor associated with three
      out of four malaria species was overnight stay in the plot hut, a human behaviour
      associated with indigenous farming. Haplotypes did not show clear geographical
      population structure, but pairwise Fst value comparison indicated higher parasite
      flow along the river. DISCUSSION: Spatial aggregation of malaria parasite
      carriers, and the identification of malaria species-specific risk factors provide
      key insights in malaria epidemiology in low transmission settings, which can
      guide targeted supplementary interventions. Consequently, future malaria
      programmes in the province should implement additional specific policies
      targeting households staying overnight at their farms outside the village, in
      addition to migrants and forest workers.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy with
      artesunate-amodiaquine-methylene blue for falciparum malaria in children: a
      randomized controlled trial in Burkina Faso.
PG  - 689-97
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methylene blue (MB) has been shown to be safe and effective against
      falciparum malaria in Africa and to have pronounced gametocytocidal properties.
      METHODS: Three days of treatment with artesunate (AS)-amodiaquine (AQ) combined
      with MB was compared with AS-AQ treatment in a randomized controlled phase IIb
      study; the study included 221 children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso. The primary end point was gametocyte
      prevalence during follow-up, as determined by microscopy and real-time
      quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA). RESULTS: The
      gametocyte prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum at baseline was 3.6% (microscopy) 
      and 97% (QT-NASBA). It was significantly lower in the AS-AQ-MB than in the AS-AQ 
      group on day 7 of follow-up (microscopy, 1.2% vs 8.9% [P < .05]; QT-NASBA, 36.7% 
      vs 63.3% [P < .001]). Hemoglobin values were significantly lower in the AS-AQ-MB 
      group than in the AS-AQ group at days 2 and 7 of follow-up. Vomiting of the study
      medication occurred significantly more frequently in the AS-AQ-MB group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MB with an artemisinin-based combination therapy 
      has been confirmed to be effective against the gametocytes of P. falciparum.
      MB-based combinations need to be compared with primaquine-based combinations,
      preferably using MB in an improved pediatric formulation. Clinical Trials
      Registration: NCT01407887.

TI  - High prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum pfcrt K76T mutation in children with
      sickle cell disease at a tertiary hospital in north-western Tanzania.
PG  - 256-60
AB  - The high prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) and trait in Sub-Saharan Africa 
      coincides with the distribution of Plasmodiumfalciparum malaria. Due to prolonged
      heavy use of chloroquine (CQ) as an antimalarial, drug resistance has developed. 
      Many countries including Tanzania abandoned the use of CQ for uncomplicated
      malaria, except its use as prophylaxis in patients with sickle cell disease. This
      study investigated the prevalence of malaria in SCD patients and mutations
      associated with CQ resistance. Children diagnosed with sickle cell disease
      attending both outpatient clinic and those admitted at Bugando Medical Centre in 
      northwestern Tanzania were screened for malaria using thick blood smear. A dried 
      blood spot on Whatman filter paper was also taken for polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Among 123 known patients with
      sickle cell disease, the prevalence of malaria by blood smear microscopy was 3.2%
      and by PCR was 13.8%. The prevalence of K76T mutation among the patients was
      81.3%. The majority of the patients (72.4%) were using chloroquine prophylaxis.
      In conclusion, the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia among children with sickle 
      cell disease attending BMC is low (3.2%) by microscopy but several children
      maintain sub patent infection detectable by PCR. The prevalence of chloroquine
      resistant P falciparum in these children was higher than that previously seen in 
      normal population in Tanzania. We recommend special attention to be paid to
      patients with sickle cell disease while studying the dynamics of drug resistant
      parasites.

TI  - Improved detection of malaria cases in island settings of Vanuatu and Kenya by
      PCR that targets the Plasmodium mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase III (cox3)
      gene.

AB  - Detection of sub-microscopic parasitemia is crucial for all malaria elimination
      programs. PCR-based methods have proven to be sensitive, but two rounds of
      amplification (nested PCR) are often needed to detect the presence of Plasmodium 
      DNA. To simplify the detection process, we designed a nested PCR method whereby
      only the primary PCR is required for the detection of the four major human
      Plasmodium species. Primers designed for the detection of the fifth species,
      Plasmodium knowlesi, were not included in this study due to the absence of
      appropriate field samples. Compared to the standard 18S rDNA PCR method, our
      cytochrome c oxidase III (cox3) method detected 10-50% more cases while
      maintaining high sensitivities (1.00) for all four Plasmodium species in our
      samples from Vanuatu (n=77) and Kenya (n=76). Improvement in detection efficiency
      was more substantial for samples with sub-microscopic parasitemia (54%) than
      those with observable parasitemia (10-16%). Our method will contribute to
      improved malaria surveillance in low endemicity settings.

TI  - Alternatively spliced transcripts and novel pseudogenes of the Plasmodium
      falciparum resistance-associated locus pfcrt detected in East African malaria
      patients.
PG  - 116-23
LID - 10.1093/jac/dku358 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Polymorphisms in the lysosomal transporter encoded by the pfcrt gene 
      directly impact on Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to aminoquinolines. The
      Lys76Thr mutation is the critical change conferring chloroquine resistance in
      vitro and in vivo, but always occurs with additional non-synonymous changes in
      the pfcrt coding sequence. We sought to better describe pfcrt polymorphisms
      distal to codon 76. METHODS: Small-volume samples (</= 500 muL) of
      parasite-infected blood collected directly from malaria patients presenting for
      treatment in Sudan and Tanzania were immediately preserved for RNA extraction.
      The pfcrt locus was amplified from cDNA preparations by nested PCR and sequenced 
      directly to derive full-length mRNA sequences. RESULTS: In one of two sites in
      Sudan, two patients were found with an unorthodox spliced form of pfcrt mRNA in
      which two exons were skipped, but it was not possible to test for the presence of
      the putative protein products of these aberrant transcripts. Genomic DNA
      sequencing from dried blood spots collected in parallel confirmed the presence of
      spliced pfcrt pseudogenes in a minority of parasite isolates. Full-length cDNA
      from conventionally spliced mRNA molecules in all study sites demonstrated the
      existence of a variety of pfcrt haplotypes in East Africa, and thus provides
      evidence of intragenic recombination. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pseudogenes,
      although unlikely to have any direct public health impact, may confound results
      obtained from simple genotyping methods that consider only codon 76 and the
      adjacent residues of pfcrt.

TI  - A prospective study on adult patients of severe malaria caused by Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and mixed infection from Bikaner, northwest India.
PG  - 200-10
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Description of severe vivax malaria and mixed species
      infection requires good clinical study. The present study was undertaken to
      evalute the characteristics of severe malaria patients in Bikaner, northwest
      India. METHODS: This prospective study included 539 admitted adult patients of
      severe malaria (Plasmodium falciparum 274, P. vivax 221, and mixed infection of
      Pv + Pf 44). The diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The
      categorization of severe malaria was done strictly as per WHO criteria. RESULTS: 
      The distribution of severe manifestation was similar in severe vivax, falciparum 
      and mixed infections except more cases of thrombocytopenia in P. vivax (p=0.030) 
      and in mixed infection (p=0.004). The risk of developing severe malaria was
      greatest in patients of mixed infection [53.01% (44/83)] in comparison to
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria [49.37% (274/555), RR= 1.135; p=0.616] and P. vivax
      malaria [45.38% (221/ 487), RR = 1.299, p=0.243]. Hepatic dysfunction was the
      commonest pernicious syndrome [P. falciparum 50% (137/274), P. vivax 43.89%
      (97/221), and mixed infections 54.55% (24/44)]. Multiorgan dysfunction was
      present in 40.26% (217/539) patients, the risk was greatest in mixed infection
      [90.90% (40/44)] in comparison to P. falciparum monoinfection [37.59% (103/274), 
      RR = 12.238; p=0.0001] or P. vivax monoinfection [33.48% (74/ 221), RR = 13.25;
      p=0.0001]. The risk of mortality in severe malaria was 6.31% (34/539) in which
      mixed infection had greater risk [9.09% (4/44)] in comparison to P. falciparum
      [7.30% (20/274); OR = 1.270 (CI 0.347-4.217); p=0.757] or P. vivax [4.52%
      (10/221); 0R 2.110 (CI 0.527-7.826); p=0.260]. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:
      Severe vivax or falciparum malaria had almost similar features and prognosis
      including mortality. Risk of developing severe malaria, multiorgan dysfunction
      and mortality was more in patients of mixed infection in comparison to P.
      falciparum or P. vivax monoinfection. A multicentric study on larger number of
      patients requires further confirmation.

TI  - Pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1 86Y allele frequency in Plasmodium falciparum isolates and
      use of self-medication in a rural area of Gabon.
PG  - 729-34
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/tru147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies showed that chloroquine resistance may revert to sensitivity 
      after its withdrawal mainly detected by a significant decrease of Plasmodium
      falciparum pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1 86Y alleles. Besides, self-medication is
      considered as a key factor of antimalarial drug resistance expansion. Thus, pfcrt
      76T and pfmdr1 86Y allele frequency and its relationship with antimalarial drug
      self-medication was analyzed in P. falciparum isolates collected in Gabon.
      METHODS: Samples were collected from febrile children screened for P. falciparum 
      infection in 2005 and 2008 at the regional hospital of Oyem. Self-use of
      antimalarial drugs before the day of consultation was recorded. Polymorphic
      codons 76 and 86 of pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS:
      The frequency of pfcrt 76T mutant allele was greater than 70.0% in 2005 and 2008.
      Wild type isolates were 1.7-fold more prevalent in 2008. The prevalence of pfmdr1
      86Y mutant allele was comparable between 2005 and 2008 (p=0.1); the proportion of
      wild type allele reached 20.5% in 2008. The frequency of wild type allele pfcrt
      K76 or pfmdr1 N86 was higher among patients without anti-malarial drug
      self-medication compared to those who used it. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of the
      frequency of P. falciparum wild type allele pfcrt 76K and pfmdr1 86N was observed
      within a short period after chloroquine withdrawal. The proportion of mutant
      genotypes is still high, mainly among patients using self-medication with
      antimalarial drugs.

TI  - Nested-PCR and a new ELISA-based NovaLisa test kit for malaria diagnosis in an
      endemic area of Thailand.
PG  - 377-81
LID - 10.3347/kjp.2014.52.4.377 [doi]
AB  - Microscopy is considered as the gold standard for malaria diagnosis although its 
      wide application is limited by the requirement of highly experienced
      microscopists. PCR and serological tests provide efficient diagnostic performance
      and have been applied for malaria diagnosis and research. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the diagnostic performance of nested PCR and a recently
      developed an ELISA-based new rapid diagnosis test (RDT), NovaLisa test kit, for
      diagnosis of malaria infection, using microscopic method as the gold standard.
      The performance of nested-PCR as a malaria diagnostic tool is excellent with
      respect to its high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ability to
      discriminate Plasmodium species. The sensitivity and specificity of nested-PCR
      compared with the microscopic method for detection of Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax, and P. falciparum/P. vivax mixed infection were 71.4 vs 100%,
      100 vs 98.7%, and 100 vs 95.0%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of 
      the ELISA-based NovaLisa test kit compared with the microscopic method for
      detection of Plasmodium genus were 89.0 vs 91.6%, respectively. NovaLisa test kit
      provided comparable diagnostic performance. Its relatively low cost, simplicity, 
      and rapidity enables large scale field application.

TI  - Efficacy of artemisinin-based combination treatments of uncomplicated falciparum 
      malaria in under-five-year-old Nigerian children.
PG  - 925-35
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0248 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of 3-day regimens of artemether-lumefantrine and
      artesunate-amodiaquine were evaluated in 747 children < 5 years of age with
      uncomplicated malaria from six geographical areas of Nigeria. Fever clearance was
      significantly faster (P = 0.006) and the proportion of children with parasitemia 
      1 day after treatment began was significantly lower (P = 0.016) in
      artesunate-amodiaquine-compared with artemether-lumefantrine-treated children.
      Parasite clearance times were similar with both treatments. Overall efficacy was 
      96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.5-97.6%), and was similar for both
      regimens. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected parasitologic cure rates on Day 28 
      were 96.9% (95% CI 93.9-98.2%) and 98.3% (95% CI 96.1-99.3%) for
      artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine, respectively. Gametocyte
      carriage post treatment was significantly lower than pretreatment (P < 0.0001).
      In anemic children, mean time to recovery from anemia was 10 days (95% CI
      9.04-10.9) and was similar for both regimens. Both treatments were well tolerated
      and are safe and efficacious treatments of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      young Nigerian children.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in North-Eastern Tanzania.
PG  - 376

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends that regular efficacy
      monitoring should be undertaken by all malaria endemic countries that have
      deployed artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). Although ACT is still efficacious
      for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance has been reported 
      in South East Asia suggesting that surveillance needs to be intensified by all
      malaria endemic countries. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria in Muheza district of north-eastern Tanzania, an area where the
      transmission has significantly declined in recent years. METHODS: Eighty eight
      children (aged 6 months to 10 years) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were
      recruited into the study. The patients were treated with standard doses of AL and
      followed up for 28 days. The primary end point was parasitological cure on day 28
      while the secondary end points included: improvement in haemoglobin levels and
      occurrence, and severity of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 163 febrile
      patients were screened, out of which 88 patients (56 under-fives and 32 aged >/= 
      5 years) were enrolled and 79 (89.8%) completed the 28 days of follow-up. There
      were no cases of early treatment failure whilst 40 (78.4%) under-fives and
      21(75.0%) older children had adequate clinical and parasitological response
      (ACPR) before PCR correction. Late clinical failure was seen in 5.6% (n=51) and
      3.6% (n=28) of the under-fives and older children respectively; while 15.7% and
      21.6% had late parasitological failure in the two groups respectively. After PCR 
      correction, ACPR was 100% in both groups. Reported adverse events included cough 
      (49.7%), fever (20.2%), abdominal pain (10.1%), diarrhoea (1.3%), headache (1.3%)
      and skin rashes (1.3%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that AL was safe,
      well-tolerated and efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
      Since Muheza has historically been a hotspot of drug resistance (e.g.
      pyrimethamine, chloroquine, and SP), surveillance needs to be continued to detect
      future changes in parasite sensitivity to ACT.

      resistance: a survey over four decades under different treatment policies in
      Brazil.
PG  - 372
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial resistance in Plasmodium falciparum remains an obstacle
      for malaria control. Resistance-associated genes were analysed in Brazilian
      samples over four decades to evaluate the impact of different treatment regimens 
      on the parasite genetic profile. METHODS: Samples were collected on filter paper 
      from patients infected in the Amazon region from 1984 to 2011. DNA was extracted 
      with Chelex(R) 100 and monoinfection confirmed by PCR. SNPs in the pfcrt, pfmdr1,
      pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were assessed by PCR-RFLP. The pfmdr1 copy number was
      estimated using real time quantitative PCR with SYBR(R) Green. Parasite response 
      was assessed ex vivo with seven concentrations of each anti-malarial. Patients
      were treated according to Brazilian guidelines: quinine plus tetracycline or
      mefloquine in period 1 and ACT in period 2. RESULTS: All 96 samples presented the
      pfcrt 76T mutant throughout the assessed periods. In addition, all isolates
      showed ex vivo chloroquine resistance. The pfmdr1 86Y was detected in 1.5% of
      samples in period 1, and in 25% in period 2. All samples presented the pfmdr1
      1246Y. The analysis of pfmdr1 copy number showed amplification in 37.3% in period
      1 and in 42% in period 2. Mutations in pfdhfr were shown as follows: 51I in all
      samples in period 1 and in 81.2% in period 2; 59R in 6.4% in period 2. The pfdhfr
      108N and the pfdhps 437G were seen in all samples along time; the pfdhps 540E in 
      93.7% in period 1 and in 75% in period 2. CONCLUSIONS: The 76T mutation
      associated to chloroquine resistance is still present in the parasite population,
      although this anti-malarial was withdrawn from the chemotherapy of P. falciparum 
      in Brazil in the mid-1980s. All isolates assayed ex vivo for chloroquine showed
      resistant phenotype and 76T. No association was observed between pfmdr1 mutations
      and resistance to quinine, mefloquine and artemisinin derivatives. Additionally, 
      the pfdhfr 108N mutation was detected in all samples throughout the evaluated
      periods, demonstrating fixation of the mutant allele in the parasite population. 
      Changes in Brazilian national guidelines for the malaria chemotherapy in the last
      27 years yielded a discreet genetic impact in the parasite population.

TI  - Asymptomatic malaria in refugees living in a non-endemic South African city.
PG  - e107693
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0107693 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic malaria infection in refugees is both a threat to the
      lives of the individuals and the public in the host country. Although South
      Africa has been experiencing an unprecedented influx of refugees since 1994, data
      on malaria infection among refugees is lacking. Such information is critical
      since South Africa is among the countries that have planned to eliminate malaria.
      The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of asymptomatic malaria
      infection among a refugee population living in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province, 
      South Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A survey was conducted on adult refugee
      participants who attended a faith-based facility offering social services in a
      city of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The participants were screened for 
      the presence of malaria using rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy. Demographic 
      data for the participants were obtained using a closed ended questionnaire. Data 
      was obtained for 303 participants consisting of 51.5% females and 47.5% males,
      ranging from 19 to 64 years old. More than 95% of them originated from
      sub-Saharan African countries. Two hundred and ninety participants provided a
      blood sample for screening of malaria. Of these, 3.8% tested positive for rapid
      diagnostic test and 5.9% for microscopy. The majority of malaria infections were 
      due to Plasmodium falciparum. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the presence of
      asymptomatic malaria infections among a refugee population residing in a city of 
      KwaZulu-Natal province that is not endemic for malaria. The results have
      important implications for both public health and malaria control in South
      Africa, particularly since the country has decided to eliminate malaria by 2018. 
      To achieve this goal, South Africa needs to expand research, surveillance and
      elimination activities to include non-endemic areas, particularly with high
      refugee populations. We further recommend use of powerful diagnostic tests such
      as PCR for these interventions.

TI  - Delayed parasite clearance after treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients in central Vietnam.
PG  - 7049-55
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02746-14 [doi]
AB  - Reduced susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum toward artemisinin derivatives
      has been reported from the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar borders. Following
      increasing reports from central Vietnam of delayed parasite clearance after
      treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), the current first-line
      treatment, we carried out a study on the efficacy of this treatment. Between
      September 2012 and February 2013, we conducted a 42-day in vivo and in vitro
      efficacy study in Quang Nam Province. Treatment was directly observed, and blood 
      samples were collected twice daily until parasite clearance. In addition,
      genotyping, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and in vitro sensitivity testing of isolates
      was performed. The primary endpoints were parasite clearance rate and time. The
      secondary endpoints included PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates, qPCR
      clearance profiles, in vitro sensitivity results (for chloroquine,
      dihydroartemisinin, and piperaquine), and genotyping for mutations in the Kelch
      13 propeller domain. Out of 672 screened patients, 95 were recruited and 89
      available for primary endpoint analyses. The median parasite clearance time (PCT)
      was 61.7 h (interquartile range [IQR], 47.6 to 83.2 h), and the median parasite
      clearance rate had a slope half-life of 6.2 h (IQR, 4.4 to 7.5 h). The
      PCR-corrected efficacy rates were estimated at 100% at day 28 and 97.7% (95%
      confidence interval, 91.2% to 99.4%) at day 42. At day 3, the P. falciparum
      prevalence by qPCR was 2.5 times higher than that by microscopy. The 50%
      inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of isolates with delayed clearance times (>/=
      72 h) were significantly higher than those with normal clearance times for all
      three drugs. Delayed parasite clearance (PCT, >/= 72 h) was significantly higher 
      among day 0 samples carrying the 543 mutant allele (47.8%) than those carrying
      the wild-type allele (1.8%; P = 0.048). In central Vietnam, the efficacy of
      DHA-PPQ is still satisfactory, but the parasite clearance time and rate are
      indicative of emerging artemisinin resistance. (This study has been registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01775592.).

AB  - The universally conserved kinase-associated endopeptidase 1 (Kae1) protein family
      has established roles in N(6)-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine tRNA modification,
      transcriptional regulation, and telomere homeostasis. These functions are
      performed in complex with a conserved core of protein binding partners. Herein we
      describe the localization, essentiality, and protein-protein interactions for
      Kae1 in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We found that the
      parasite expresses one Kae1 protein in the cytoplasm and a second protein in the 
      apicoplast, a chloroplast remnant organelle involved in fatty acid, heme, and
      isoprenoid biosynthesis. To analyze the protein interaction networks for both
      Kae1 pathways, we developed a new proteomic cross-validation approach. This
      strategy compares immunoprecipitation-MS data sets across different cellular
      compartments to enrich for biologically relevant protein interactions. Our
      results show that cytoplasmic Kae1 forms a complex with Bud32 and Cgi121 as in
      other organisms, whereas apicoplast Kae1 makes novel interactions with multiple
      proteins in the apicoplast. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoprecipitation studies
      indicate that apicoplast Kae1 and its partners interact specifically with the
      apicoplast ribosomes and with proteins involved in ribosome function. Together,
      these data indicate an expanded, apicoplast-specific role for Kae1 in the
      parasite.

AB  - The four main Plasmodium species that cause human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale, are transmitted
      between humans by mosquito vectors belonging to the genus Anopheles. It has
      recently become evident that Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite that typically
      infects forest macaque monkeys, can be transmitted by anophelines to cause
      malaria in humans in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium knowlesi infections are
      frequently misdiagnosed microscopically as P. malariae. Direct human to human
      transmission of P. knowlesi by anophelines has not yet been established to occur 
      in nature. Knowlesi malaria must therefore be presently considered a zoonotic
      disease. Polymerase chain reaction is now the definitive method for
      differentiating P. knowlesi from P. malariae and other human malaria parasites.
      The origin of P. falciparum and P. vivax in African apes are examples of ancient 
      zoonoses that may be continuing at the present time with at least P. vivax, and
      possibly P. malariae and P. ovale. Other non-human primate malaria species, e.g.,
      Plasmodium cynomolgi in Southeast Asia and Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium 
      simium in South America, can be transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors further
      emphasizing the potential for continuing zoonoses. The potential for zoonosis is 
      influenced by human habitation and behavior as well as the adaptive capabilities 
      of parasites and vectors. There is insufficient knowledge of the bionomics of
      Anopheles vector populations relevant to the cross-species transfer of malaria
      parasites and the real extent of malaria zoonoses. Appropriate strategies, based 
      on more research, need to be developed for the prevention, diagnosis, and
      treatment of zoonotic malaria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate 4 combinations of mutations responsible for
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in a rural community of
      Burkina Faso, a malaria endemic country. METHODS: Two hundred individuals in a
      rural community were genotyped for the mutations A376G, G202A, A542T, G680T and
      T968C using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism assays and polymerase chain
      reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of the G6PD deficiency was 9.5% in the study population. It was
      significantly higher in men compared to women (14.3% vs 6.0%, P=0.049). The
      202A/376G G6PD A- was the only deficient variant detected. Plasmodium falciparum 
      asymptomatic parasitaemia was significantly higher among the G6PD-non-deficient
      persons compared to the G6PD-deficient (P<0.001). The asymptomatic parasitaemia
      was also significantly higher among G6PD non-deficient compared to
      G6PD-heterozygous females (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the G6PD
      A- variant associated with protection against asymptomatic malaria in Burkina
      Faso is probably the most common deficient variant.

PG  - 598-602

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic diversity at the msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes of
      Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolates from 3 endemic areas in Thailand: 
      Tak, Kanchanaburi and Ranong provinces. METHODS: A total of 144 P. falciparum
      isolates collected prior to treatment during January, 2012 to June, 2013 were
      genotyped. DNA was extracted; allele frequency and diversity of msp-1, msp-2, and
      glurp genes were investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: P.
      falciparum isolates in this study had high rate of multiple genotypes infection
      (96.5%) with an overall mean multiplicity of infection of 3.21. The distribution 
      of allelic families of msp-1 was significantly different among isolates from Tak,
      Kanchanaburi, and Ranong but not for the msp-2. K1 and MAD20 were the predominant
      allelic families at the msp-1 gene, whereas alleles belonging to 3D7 were more
      frequent at the msp-2 gene. The glurp gene had the least diverse alleles.
      Population structure of P. falciparum isolates from Tak and Ranong was quite
      similar as revealed by the presence of similar proportions of MAD20 and K1
      alleles at msp-1 loci, 3D7 and FC27 alleles at msp-2 loci as well as comparable
      mean MOI. Isolates from Kanchanaburi had different structures; the most prevalent
      alleles were K1 and RO33. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that P. falciparum
      isolates from Tak and Ranong provinces had similar allelic pattern of msp-1 and
      msp-2 and diversity but different from Kanchanaburi isolates. These allelic
      variant profiles are valuable baseline data for future epidemiological study of
      malaria transmission and for continued monitoring of polymorphisms associated
      with antimalarial drug resistance in these areas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum (P.
      falciparum) using msp-1 and msp-2 as antigenic markers. METHODS: Parasite DNA was
      extracted from 100 blood samples collected from P. falciparum-positive patients
      confirmed by microscopy, and followed by PCR-genotyping targeting the msp-1
      (block2) and msp-2 (block 3) allelic families. RESULTS: All the families of msp-1
      (K1, MAD20 and R033) and msp-2 (FC27 and 3D7) locus were observed. Results
      revealed that K1 (60/100) was the most predominant genotype of msp-1 allelic
      family followed by the genotypes of MAD20 (50/100) and R033 (45/100). In the
      msp-2 locus, FC27 genotype (62/100) showed higher frequency than 3D7 genotype
      (55/100). The allelic families were detected either alone or in combination with 
      other families. However, no R033/MAD20 combination was observed. Multiplicity of 
      infection (MOI) with msp-1 was higher in the locality of Ikorodu (1.50) than in
      Lekki (1.39). However, MOI with msp-2 was lower in the locality of Ikorodu (1.14)
      than in Lekki (1.76). There was no significant difference in the mean MOI between
      the two study areas (P=0.427). CONCLUSIONS: The observation of limited diversity 
      of malaria parasites may imply that the use of antigenic markers as genotyping
      tools for distinguishing recrudescence and re-infections with P. falciparum
      during drug trials is subjective.

      gambiae populations to Plasmodium falciparum: a hindrance for vector control.
PG  - 340
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of generalization of insecticide resistance, the
      hypothesis that insecticide resistance has a positive impact on the capacity of
      mosquitoes to transmit malaria constitutes a hindrance for malaria elimination.
      The aim of this study was to investigated populations of Anopheles coluzzii and
      Anopheles gambiae S molecular form to assess whether different genotypes at the
      kdr locus are responsible for different susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum
      infection. METHODS: F3 progeny of An. gambiae s.l. collected in Dielmo were
      infected by direct membrane feeding with P. falciparum gametocyte-containing
      blood sampled from volunteer patients. The presence of oocysts was determined by 
      light microscopy after seven days, and the presence of sporozoites by ELISA after
      14 days. Mosquito species and molecular forms were identified by PCR. Generalized
      linear models were performed using the R software to test the effect of
      explanatory variables including the genotype at the kdr locus on infection rate
      and density. RESULTS: The odds of being infected with oocysts and sporozoites
      were greater in RS and RR groups than in SS groups (chi2 = 42.8, df = 1, P(>chi2)
      = 6.1e-11). The density of infection was also dependent on genotype, with RR and 
      RS genotypes showing denser infection than SS genotypes. Pairwise comparisons of 
      oocyst number and absorbance indicated sometime a small betwen species (i.e.
      between An. gambiae S form, and An. coluzzii), but the effect of genotype was
      much more important. CONCLUSION: The presence of the resistance allele at the kdr
      locus increases susceptibility to Plasmodium not only at the oocyst stage but
      also at the sporozoite stage in non-genetically modified wild mosquitoes. These
      results have significant implications and should be taken into account in the
      development of strategies for malaria control.

TI  - Epidemiology of disappearing Plasmodium vivax malaria: a case study in rural
      Amazonia.
PG  - e3109
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New frontier settlements across the Amazon Basin pose a major
      challenge for malaria elimination in Brazil. Here we describe the epidemiology of
      malaria during the early phases of occupation of farming settlements in
      Remansinho area, Brazilian Amazonia. We examine the relative contribution of
      low-density and asymptomatic parasitemias to the overall Plasmodium vivax burden 
      over a period of declining transmission and discuss potential hurdles for malaria
      elimination in Remansinho and similar settings. METHODS: Eight community-wide
      cross-sectional surveys, involving 584 subjects, were carried out in Remansinho
      over 3 years and complemented by active and passive surveillance of febrile
      illnesses between the surveys. We used quantitative PCR to detect low-density
      asexual parasitemias and gametocytemias missed by conventional microscopy.
      Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression models were used to characterize
      independent risk factors for P. vivax infection and disease. PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: P. vivax prevalence decreased from 23.8% (March-April 2010)
      to 3.0% (April-May 2013), with no P. falciparum infections diagnosed after
      March-April 2011. Although migrants from malaria-free areas were at increased
      risk of malaria, their odds of having P. vivax infection and disease decreased by
      2-3% with each year of residence in Amazonia. Several findings indicate that
      low-density and asymptomatic P. vivax parasitemias may complicate residual
      malaria elimination in Remansinho: (a) the proportion of subpatent infections
      (i.e. missed by microscopy) increased from 43.8% to 73.1% as P. vivax
      transmission declined; (b) most (56.6%) P. vivax infections were asymptomatic and
      32.8% of them were both subpatent and asymptomatic; (c) asymptomatic parasite
      carriers accounted for 54.4% of the total P. vivax biomass in the host
      population; (d) over 90% subpatent and asymptomatic P. vivax had PCR-detectable
      gametocytemias; and (e) few (17.0%) asymptomatic and subpatent P. vivax
      infections that were left untreated progressed to clinical disease over 6 weeks
      of follow-up and became detectable by routine malaria surveillance.

TI  - Immunochromatographic antigen testing alone is sufficient to identify
      asymptomatic refugees at risk of severe malaria presenting to a single health

AB  - Current screening guidelines for malaria in new refugees include a combination of
      thick and thin film examination and immunochromatographic antigen test (ICT).
      However, as the prevalence of malaria in our population has decreased due to
      changing refugee demographics, we sought to determine if an ICT alone can
      reliably exclude malaria in our asymptomatic refugee population.A retrospective
      analysis was conducted of all investigations for malaria performed from 1 August 
      2011 to 31 July 2013, including thick and thin blood film examination, BinaxNOW
      ICT, and external morphological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) validation
      where applicable.Malaria was diagnosed in 45 of 1248 (3.6%) patients
      investigated, all of whom were symptomatic and the majority (71.1%) returned
      travellers. All 599 asymptomatic refugees screened were negative. Overall, 42 of 
      45 malaria cases were detected by the ICT; sensitivity 93.3% (95% CI 80.7-98.3%) 
      and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.8% (99.2-99.9%). All 21 cases of
      Plasmodium falciparum and 20 of 22 cases of Plasmodium vivax were detected,
      giving a sensitivity of 100% (80.8-100%) and 90.9% (69.4-98.4%) respectively. Too
      few cases of Plasmodium malariae and no cases of Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium
      knowlesi were diagnosed for adequate assessment to be carried out.These data
      suggest that full malaria screening in all asymptomatic refugees with the
      combination of thick and thin blood films and rapid antigen test may not be
      warranted. Alternative screening approaches should be considered, including the
      use of ICT alone, or limiting screening of asymptomatic refugees to only those
      originating from countries with high incidence of malaria.

AB  - Malaria remains one of the world's most common infectious diseases, being
      responsible for more deaths than any other communicable disease except
      tuberculosis. There is strong evidence that tumour necrosis factor alpha and
      interleukin-1beta are important contributors to the systemic disease caused by
      the infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Circulating levels of TNFalpha are
      increased after infection, as a consequence of stimulation of
      monocyte-macrophages by infected red blood cells or parasite products, as shown
      in vitro for the malaria pigment haemozoin. TNFalpha in turn enhances the
      synthesis of metalloproteinase-9 in monocytes and macrophages.
      Metalloproteinase-9 acts on the extracellular matrix but also on non-traditional 
      substrates, including precursors of inflammatory cytokines, which are
      proteolytically activated and contribute to the amplification of the inflammatory
      response. The aim of the present work was to establish whether artemisinin and
      its derivatives artemisone, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin possess
      immuno-modulatory properties. In particular, it is necessary to evaluate their
      effects on mRNA levels and secretion of MMP-9 by the human monocytic cell line
      (THP-1 cells) stimulated by hemozoin or TNFalpha. 5muM of each derivative,
      although not artemisinin itself, induced significantly inhibited TNFalpha
      production. Artesunate, artemisone and DHA antagonized haemozoin-induced MMP-9
      secretion by 25%, 24% and 50%, respectively. mRNA levels were also depressed by
      14%, 20% and 27%, respectively, thus reflecting in part the effect observed on
      protein production. The derivatives significantly inhibited both TNFalpha-induced
      MMP-9 secretion and mRNA levels to a greater extent than haemozoin itself. Both
      haemozoin and TNFalpha increased NF-kappaB driven transcription by 11 and 7.7
      fold, respectively. Artesunate, artemisone and DHA inhibited haemozoin-induced
      NF-kappaB driven transcription by 28%, 34%, and 49%, respectively. Similarly the 
      derivatives, but not artemisinin, prevented TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB driven
      transcription by 47-51%. The study indicates that artemisinins may attenuate the 
      inflammatory potential of monocytes in vivo. Thus, in addition to direct
      anti-parasitic activities, the beneficial clinical effects of artemisinins for
      the treatment of malaria include the apparent ability to attenuate the
      inflammatory response, thus limiting the risk of progression to the more severe
      form of the disease, including the onset of cerebral malaria.

TI  - Allelic Forms of Merozoite Surface Protein-3 in Plasmodium falciparum Isolates
      From Southeast of Iran.
PG  - e9829
LID - 10.5812/jjm.9829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity has provided Plasmodium falciparum with the
      potential capacity of avoiding the immune response, and possibly supported the
      natural selection of drug or vaccine-resistant parasites. Merozoite surface
      protein-3 (MSP-3) has been used to develop vaccines and investigate the genetic
      diversity regarding P. falciparum malaria in Iran. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of
      this study was to analyze the polymorphic antigen MSP-3 genes across southeast of
      Iran among four different districts, to identify the differences in the allele
      frequency and genetic diversity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nested polymerase chain
      reaction amplification was used to determine polymorphisms of N-terminal region
      of the MSP-3 gene. A total of 85 microscopically positive P. falciparum infected 
      individuals from southeast of Iran were included in this study. RESULTS: Of the
      85 confirmed P. falciparum samples obtained from four different districts, 72
      were successfully scored for MSP-3.The MSP-3 allele classes (K1 and 3D7 types)
      showed comparable prevalence in all districts. Overall frequencies of K1 and 3D7 
      allele classes were 94.5 % for both. CONCLUSIONS: Since no study has yet looked
      at the extent of P. falciparum MSP-3 in this geographic region, these data can be
      helpful to support development of a vaccine based on MSP-3 against malaria. There
      should be a comparative analysis in different seasonal peaks to indicate the
      allelic polymorphism of MSP-3 over a period.

TI  - Persistently high estimates of late night, indoor exposure to malaria vectors
      despite high coverage of insecticide treated nets.
PG  - 380
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been speculated that widespread and sustained use of
      insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) for over 10 years in Asembo, western Kenya,
      may have selected for changes in the location (indoor versus outdoor) and time
      (from late night to earlier in the evening) of biting of the predominant species 
      of human malaria vectors (Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto,
      and Anopheles arabiensis). METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected by human landing
      catches over a six week period in June and July, 2011, indoors and outdoors from 
      17 h to 07 h, in 75 villages in Asembo, western Kenya. Collections were separated
      by hour of the night, and mosquitoes were identified to species and tested for
      sporozoite infection with Plasmodium falciparum. A subset was dissected to
      determine parity. Human behavior (time going to bed and rising, time spent
      indoors and outdoors) was quantified by cross-sectional survey. Data from past
      studies of a similar design and in nearby settings, but conducted before the ITN 
      scale up commenced in the early 2000s, were compared with those from the present 
      study. RESULTS: Of 1,960 Anopheles mosquitoes collected in 2011, 1,267 (64.6%)
      were morphologically identified as An. funestus, 663 (33.8%) as An. gambiae sensu
      lato (An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis combined), and 30 (1.5%) as other
      anophelines. Of the 663 An. gambiae s.l. collected, 385 were successfully tested 
      by PCR among which 235 (61.0%) were identified as An. gambiae s.s. while 150
      (39.0%) were identified as An. arabiensis. Compared with data collected before
      the scale-up of ITNs, daily entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) were
      consistently lower for An. gambiae s.l. (indoor EIR = 0.432 in 1985-1988, 0.458
      in 1989-1990, 0.023 in 2011), and An. arabiensis specifically (indoor EIR = 0.532
      in 1989-1990, 0.039 in 2009, 0.006 in 2011) but not An. funestus (indoor EIR =
      0.029 in 1985-1988, 0.147 in 1989-1990, 0.010 in 2009 and 0.103 in 2011).
      Sporozoite rates were lowest in 2009 but rose again in 2011. Compared with data
      collected before the scale-up of ITNs, An. arabiensis and An. funestus were more 
      likely to bite outdoors and/or early in the evening (p < 0.001 for all
      comparisons). However, when estimates of human exposure that would occur indoors 
      (pii) or while asleep (pis) in the absence of an ITN were generated based on
      human behavioral patterns, the changes were modest with >90% of exposure of
      non-ITN users to mosquito bites occurring while people were indoors in all years.
      The proportion of bites occurring among non-ITN users while they were asleep was 
      >/=90% for all species except for An. arabiensis. For this species, 97% of bites 
      occurred while people were asleep in 1989-1990 while in 2009 and 2011, 80% and
      84% of bites occurred while people were asleep for those not using ITNs. Assuming
      ITNs prevent a theoretical maximum of 93.7% of bites, it was estimated that
      64-77% of bites would have occurred among persons using nets while they were
      asleep in 1989-1990, while 20-52% of bites would have occurred among persons
      using nets while they were asleep in 2009 and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: This study found
      no evidence to support the contention that populations of Anopheles vectors of
      malaria in Asembo, western Kenya, are exhibiting departures from the well-known
      pattern of late night, indoor biting characteristic of these typically highly
      anthropophilic species. While outdoor, early evening transmission likely does
      occur in western Kenya, the majority of transmission still occurs indoors, late
      at night. Therefore, malaria control interventions such as ITNs that aim to
      reduce indoor biting by mosquitoes should continue to be prioritized.

AB  - The frequency of mutations in pfCRT and DHFR/DHPS genes of Plasmodium falciparum 
      associated with resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was
      evaluated in 83 strains from the districts of Esmeralda and Machala, located on
      the borders of Ecuador-Peru and Ecuador-Colombia in 2002. Polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR), conventional and its variants, was used. Mutations in the pfCRT
      gene were found in more than 90% of the samples from Esmeralda and Machala. For
      the DHFR gene, 90% of the strains were mutant samples from Esmeralda, 3 were
      double mutations and 1 was a triple mutation. In Machala, 25% were simple mutant 
      forms and 75% mixed mutant forms (wild forms/mutant). In conclusion, resistance
      to chloroquine has been fixed in strains carrying K76T pfCRT mutation, whereas
      genetic imprinting for resistance to pyrimethamine is evolving, particularly in
      the district of Esmeralda.

TI  - Comparison of three methods for detection of gametocytes in Melanesian children
      treated for uncomplicated malaria.
PG  - 319
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gametocytes are the transmission stages of Plasmodium parasites, the 
      causative agents of malaria. As their density in the human host is typically low,
      they are often undetected by conventional light microscopy. Furthermore,
      application of RNA-based molecular detection methods for gametocyte detection
      remains challenging in remote field settings. In the present study, a detailed
      comparison of three methods, namely light microscopy, magnetic fractionation and 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax gametocytes was conducted. METHODS: Peripheral
      blood samples from 70 children aged 0.5 to five years with uncomplicated malaria 
      who were treated with either artemether-lumefantrine or artemisinin-naphthoquine 
      were collected from two health facilities on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.
      The samples were taken prior to treatment (day 0) and at pre-specified intervals 
      during follow-up. Gametocytes were measured in each sample by three methods: i)
      light microscopy (LM), ii) quantitative magnetic fractionation (MF) and, iii)
      reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR). Data were analysed using censored linear
      regression and Bland and Altman techniques. RESULTS: MF and RTPCR were similarly 
      sensitive and specific, and both were superior to LM. Overall, there were
      approximately 20% gametocyte-positive samples by LM, whereas gametocyte
      positivity by MF and RTPCR were both more than two-fold this level. In the subset
      of samples collected prior to treatment, 29% of children were positive by LM, and
      85% were gametocyte positive by MF and RTPCR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The
      present study represents the first direct comparison of standard LM, MF and RTPCR
      for gametocyte detection in field isolates. It provides strong evidence that MF
      is superior to LM and can be used to detect gametocytaemic patients under field
      conditions with similar sensitivity and specificity as RTPCR.

TI  - In vivo efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children: a multisite,
      open-label, two-cohort, clinical trial in Mozambique.
PG  - 309
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mozambique adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for
      the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the year 2006,
      and since 2009 artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ)
      have been proposed as alternative first-line treatments. A multicentre study was 
      conducted in five sites across the country to assess the in vivo efficacy and
      tolerability of these two drugs. METHODS: Children aged six to 59 months with
      uncomplicated malaria were recruited between June 2011 and January 2012 in five
      sites across Mozambique (Montepuez, Dondo, Tete, Chokwe, and Manhica), and
      treated with AL or ASAQ in a non-randomized study. Follow-up was organized
      following standard WHO recommendations for in vivo studies, and included daily
      visits during the three-day-long supervised treatment course, followed by weekly 
      visits up to day 28. The study primary outcome was the day 28 PCR-corrected early
      treatment failure (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF), late parasitological
      failure (LPF), and adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). PCR was
      performed centrally for all cases of recurrent parasitaemia from day 7 onwards to
      distinguish recrudescence from re-infection. RESULTS: Four-hundred and
      thirty-nine (AL cohort; five sites) and 261 (ASAQ cohort, three sites) children
      were recruited to the study. Day 28 PCR-corrected efficacy for AL was 96.0%
      (335/339; 95% CI: 93.4-97.8), while for ASAQ it was 99.6% (232/233; 95% CI:
      97.6-99.9). The majority of recurring parasitaemia cases throughout follow-up
      were shown to be re-infections by PCR. Both drugs were well tolerated, with the
      most frequent adverse event being vomiting (AL 4.5% [20/439]; ASAQ 9.6% [25/261])
      and no significant events deemed related to the study drugs. CONCLUSION: This
      study confirms that both AL and ASAQ remain highly efficacious and well tolerated
      for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Mozambican children. Studies such
      as these should be replicated regularly in the selected surveillance sentinel
      sites to continuously monitor the efficacy of these drugs and to rapidly detect
      any potential signs of declining efficacy to ACT, the mainstay of malaria
      treatment.

      states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India.
PG  - e103848
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0103848 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is not
      clearly understood. However, CQ resistance has been shown to be associated with
      point mutations in Pfcrt and Pfmdr1. These genes encode for digestive vacuole
      transmembrane proteins Pfcrt and Pgh1, respectively. The present study was
      carried out to analyze the association of Pfcrt-K76T and Pfmdr1-N86Y mutations
      with CQ resistance in Northeast Indian P. falciparum isolates. 115 P. falciparum 
      isolates were subjected to in vitro CQ sensitivity testing and PCR-RFLP analysis 
      for the Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T mutations. 100 isolates of P. falciparum were 
      found to be resistant to CQ by the in vitro susceptibility test (geometric mean
      EC50 2.21 microM/L blood) while 15 were found to be CQ sensitive (geometric mean 
      EC50 0.32 microM/L blood). All the CQ resistant isolates showed the presence of
      Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt mutations. CQ sensitive isolates were negative for these
      mutations. Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the alleles at
      these two loci (Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T). The results indicate that
      Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T mutations can be used as molecular markers to identify
      CQ resistance in P. falciparum. The result necessitates the evaluation of CQ in
      vivo therapeutic efficacy in endemic areas for more effective malaria control
      strategies.

TI  - Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) accurately detects malaria DNA from
      filter paper blood samples of low density parasitaemias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides an opportunity
      for improved, field-friendly detection of malaria infections in endemic areas.
      However data on the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP for active case detection,
      particularly low-density parasitaemias, are lacking. We therefore evaluated the
      performance of a new LAMP kit compared with PCR using DNA from filter paper blood
      spots. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Samples from 865 fever patients and 465 asymptomatic
      individuals collected in Zanzibar were analysed for Pan (all species) and Pf (P. 
      falciparum) DNA with the Loopamp MALARIA Pan/Pf kit. Samples were amplified at 65
      degrees C for 40 minutes in a real-time turbidimeter and results were compared
      with nested PCR. Samples with discordant results between LAMP and nested PCR were
      analysed with real-time PCR. The real-time PCR corrected nested PCR result was
      defined as gold standard. Among the 117 (13.5%) PCR detected P. falciparum
      infections from fever patients (mean parasite density 7491/microL, range
      6-782,400) 115, 115 and 111 were positive by Pan-LAMP, Pf-LAMP and nested PCR,
      respectively. The sensitivities were 98.3% (95%CI 94-99.8) for both Pan and
      Pf-LAMP. Among the 54 (11.6%) PCR positive samples from asymptomatic individuals 
      (mean parasite density 10/microL, range 0-4972) Pf-LAMP had a sensitivity of
      92.7% (95%CI 80.1-98.5) for detection of the 41 P. falciparum infections.
      Pan-LAMP had sensitivities of 97% (95%CI 84.2-99.9) and 76.9% (95%CI 46.2-95) for
      detection of P. falciparum and P. malariae, respectively. The specificities for
      both Pan and Pf-LAMP were 100% (95%CI 99.1-100) in both study groups. CONCLUSION:
      Both components of the Loopamp MALARIA Pan/Pf detection kit revealed high
      diagnostic accuracy for parasite detection among fever patients and importantly
      also among asymptomatic individuals of low parasite densities from minute blood
      volumes preserved on filter paper. These data support LAMPs potential role for
      improved detection of low-density malaria infections in pre-elimination settings.

TI  - Antibody recognition of Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells by
      symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the Brazilian Amazon.
PG  - 598-601
LID - S0074-02762014005040027 [pii]
AB  - In the Amazon Region, there is a virtual absence of severe malaria and few fatal 
      cases of naturally occurring Plasmodium falciparum infections; this presents an
      intriguing and underexplored area of research. In addition to the rapid access of
      infected persons to effective treatment, one cause of this phenomenon might be
      the recognition of cytoadherent variant proteins on the infected red blood cell
      (IRBC) surface, including the var gene encoded P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
      protein 1. In order to establish a link between cytoadherence, IRBC surface
      antibody recognition and the presence or absence of malaria symptoms, we
      phenotype-selected four Amazonian P. falciparum isolates and the laboratory
      strain 3D7 for their cytoadherence to CD36 and ICAM1 expressed on CHO cells. We
      then mapped the dominantly expressed var transcripts and tested whether
      antibodies from symptomatic or asymptomatic infections showed a differential
      recognition of the IRBC surface. As controls, the 3D7 lineages expressing severe 
      disease-associated phenotypes were used. We showed that there was no profound
      difference between the frequency and intensity of antibody recognition of the
      IRBC-exposed P. falciparum proteins in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic infections.
      The 3D7 lineages, which expressed severe malaria-associated phenotypes, were
      strongly recognised by most, but not all plasmas, meaning that the recognition of
      these phenotypes is frequent in asymptomatic carriers, but is not necessarily a
      prerequisite to staying free of symptoms.

TI  - Prevalence of pfmdr1 alleles associated with artemether-lumefantrine
      tolerance/resistance in Maputo before and after the implementation of
      artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 300
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mozambique implemented artemisinin-based combinations therapy (ACT)
      using artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated 
      malaria in 2009. AL remains highly efficacious, but widespread use may soon
      facilitate emergence of artemisinin tolerance/resistance. The prevalence of
      pfmdr1 different alleles in Maputo and Mozambique is not known, either after or
      before the introduction of ACT. Pfmdr1 molecular markers related to Plasmodium
      falciparum susceptibility were analysed before and after transition to ACT.
      METHODS: A first group of samples was collected between June 2003 and June 2005
      and a second group in the period between March 2010 and March 2012. Three alleles
      were analysed by PCR-RFLP: N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y, in the pfmdr1 gene. RESULTS:
      Alleles N86, 184F and D1246 increased from 19.5, 19.6 and 74.4% in 2003-2005 to
      73.2, 22.7 and 96.7% in 2010-2012, respectively. After implementation of ACT
      (2010-2012), pfmdr1 haplotypes, either two- and three-codon basis, were generally
      less diverse than before the implementation of ACT (2003-2005). The prevalence of
      haplotypes N86-184Y, N86-D1246 and 184Y-D1246 increased from 12,2, 27.3 and 71.7%
      in 2003-2005 to 59.4, 84.3 and 78.6% in 2010-2012. The three-codon basis
      haplotypes NFD and NYD also increased significantly during the same period.
      CONCLUSION: The alleles N86 and 184 F and the triple haplotype N86-184 F-D1246
      showed a significantly increased prevalence after introduction of ACT.

TI  - Molecular evidence of Plasmodium vivax mono and mixed malaria parasite infections
      in Duffy-negative native Cameroonians.
PG  - e103262
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0103262 [doi]
AB  - The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is known to be majorly endemic to Asian and
      Latin American countries with no or very few reports of Africans infected with
      this parasite. Since the human Duffy antigens act as receptors for P. vivax to
      invade human RBCs and Africans are generally Duffy-negative, non-endemicity of P.
      vivax in Africa has been attributed to this fact. However, recent reports
      describing P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative Africans from West and Central
      parts of Africa have been surfaced including a recent report on P. vivax
      infection in native Cameroonians. In order to know if Cameroonians living in the 
      southern regions are also susceptible to P. vivax infection, we collected
      finger-prick blood samples from 485 malarial symptomatic patients in five
      locations and followed PCR diagnostic assays with DNA sequencing of the 18S
      ribosomal RNA gene. Out of the 201 malaria positive cases detected, 193 were pure
      P. falciparum, six pure P. vivax and two mixed parasite infections (P. falciparum
      + P. vivax). The eight P. vivax infected samples (six single + two mixed) were
      further subjected to DNA sequencing of the P. vivax multidrug resistance 1
      (pvmdr1) and the P.vivax circumsporozoite (pvcsp) genes. Alignment of the eight
      Cameroonian pvmdr1 sequences with the reference sequence showed high sequence
      similarities, reconfirming P. vivax infection in all the eight patients. DNA
      sequencing of the pvcsp gene indicated all the eight P. vivax to be of VK247
      type. Interestingly, DNA sequencing of a part of the human Duffy gene covering
      the promoter region in the eight P. vivax-infected Cameroonians to identify the
      T-33C mutation revealed all these patients as Duffy-negative. The results provide
      evidence of single P. vivax as well as mixed malaria parasite infection in native
      Cameroonians and add knowledge to the growing evidences of P. vivax infection in 
      Duffy-negative Africans.

TI  - In depth annotation of the Anopheles gambiae mosquito midgut transcriptome.
PG  - 636
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-15-636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome sequencing of Anopheles gambiae was completed more than ten
      years ago and has accelerated research on malaria transmission. However,
      annotation needs to be refined and verified experimentally, as most predicted
      transcripts have been identified by comparative analysis with genomes from other 
      species. The mosquito midgut-the first organ to interact with Plasmodium
      parasites-mounts effective antiplasmodial responses that limit parasite survival 
      and disease transmission. High-throughput Illumina sequencing of the midgut
      transcriptome was used to identify new genes and transcripts, contributing to the
      refinement of An. gambiae genome annotation. RESULTS: We sequenced ~223 million
      reads from An. gambiae midgut cDNA libraries generated from susceptible (G3) and 
      refractory (L35) mosquito strains. Mosquitoes were infected with either
      Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium falciparum, and midguts were collected after the
      first or second Plasmodium infection. In total, 22,889 unique midgut transcript
      models were generated from both An. gambiae strain sequences combined, and 76%
      are potentially novel. Of these novel transcripts, 49.5% aligned with annotated
      genes and appear to be isoforms or pre-mRNAs of reference transcripts, while
      50.5% mapped to regions between annotated genes and represent novel intergenic
      transcripts (NITs). Predicted models were validated for midgut expression using
      qRT-PCR and microarray analysis, and novel isoforms were confirmed by sequencing 
      predicted intron-exon boundaries. Coding potential analysis revealed that 43% of 
      total midgut transcripts appear to be long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and
      functional annotation of NITs showed that 68% had no homology to current
      databases from other species. Reads were also analyzed using de novo assembly and
      predicted transcripts compared with genome mapping-based models. Finally, variant
      analysis of G3 and L35 midgut transcripts detected 160,742 variants with respect 
      to the An. gambiae PEST genome, and 74% were new variants. Intergenic transcripts
      had a higher frequency of variation compared with non-intergenic transcripts.
      CONCLUSION: This in-depth Illumina sequencing and assembly of the An. gambiae
      midgut transcriptome doubled the number of known transcripts and tripled the
      number of variants known in this mosquito species. It also revealed existence of 
      a large number of lncRNA and opens new possibilities for investigating the
      biological function of many newly discovered transcripts.

TI  - Double mutation in the pfmdr1 gene is associated with emergence of
      chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Eastern India.
PG  - 5909-15
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02762-14 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries,
      including India. This study elucidates the cause of chloroquine treatment failure
      (for Plasmodium falciparum infection) before the introduction of artemisinin
      combination therapy. One hundred twenty-six patients were randomized to
      chloroquine treatment, and the therapeutic efficacy was monitored from days 1 to 
      28. An in vitro susceptibility test was performed with all isolates. Parasitic
      DNA was isolated, followed by PCR and restriction digestion of different codons
      of the pfcrt gene (codons 72 to 76) and the pfmdr1 gene (N86Y, Y184F, S1034C,
      N1042D, and D1246Y). Finally, sequencing was done to confirm the mutations.
      Forty-three (34.13%) early treatment failure cases and 16 (12.69%) late treatment
      failure cases were observed after chloroquine treatment. In vitro chloroquine
      resistance was found in 103 isolates (81.75%). Twenty-six (60.47%) early
      treatment failure cases and 6 (37.5%) late treatment failure cases were
      associated with the CVMNK-YYSNY allele (the underlined amino acids are those that
      were mutated). Moreover, the CVIEK-YYSNY allele was found in 8 early treatment
      failure (18.60%) and 2 late treatment failure (12.5%) cases. The presence of the 
      wild-type pfcrt (CVMNK) and pfmdr1 (YYSNY) double mutant allele in
      chloroquine-nonresponsive cases was quite uncommon. In vivo chloroquine treatment
      failure and in vitro chloroquine resistance were strongly correlated with the
      CVMNK-YYSNY and CVIEK-YYSNY haplotypes (P < 0.01).

PG  - 289
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-289 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood group O protects African children against severe malaria and
      has reached high prevalence in malarious regions. However, its role in malaria in
      pregnancy is ambiguous. In 839 delivering Ghanaian women, associations of ABO
      blood groups with Plasmodium falciparum infection were examined. METHODS:
      Plasmodium falciparum infection was diagnosed in placental blood samples by
      microscopy and PCR assays. Present or past infection was defined as the detection
      of parasitaemia or haemozoin by microscopy, or a positive PCR result. Blood
      groups were inferred from genotyping rs8176719 (indicating the O allele) and
      rs8176746/rs8176747 (distinguishing the B allele from the A allele). RESULTS: The
      majority of women had blood group O (55.4%); present or past P. falciparum
      infection was seen in 62.3% of all women. Among multiparae, the blood groups had 
      no influence on P. falciparum infection. In contrast, primiparae with blood group
      O had significantly less present or past infection than women with non-O blood
      groups (61.5 vs 76.2%, P = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, the odds of present 
      or past placental P. falciparum infection were reduced by 45% in blood group O
      primiparae (aOR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33-0.94]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows 
      a clear protective effect of blood group O against malaria in primiparae. This
      accords with findings in severe malaria and in vitro results. The data underline 
      the relevance of host genetic protection among primiparae, i.e. the high-risk
      group for malaria in pregnancy, and contribute to the understanding of high O
      allele frequencies in Africa.

      human malaria infection trials at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.
PG  - 288
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has allowed for precise 
      quantification of parasites in the prepatent period and greatly improved the
      reproducibility and statistical power of controlled human malaria infection
      (CHMI) trials. Parasitological data presented here are from non-immunized,
      control-challenged subjects who participated in two CHMI trials conducted at the 
      Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). METHODS: Standardized sporozoite 
      challenge was achieved through the bite of five Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes
      infected with the 3D7clone of the NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Blood
      smears were scored positive when two unambiguous parasites were found. Analysis
      of parasitological PCR data was performed on log-transformed data using an
      independent sample t-test when comparing the two studies. The multiplication rate
      of blood-stage parasites was estimated using the linear model. RESULTS: On
      average, parasites were detected 4.91 days (95% CI = 4.190 to 5.627) before
      smears. The earliest parasites were detected within 120 hours (5.01 days) after
      challenge. Parasite densities showed consistent cyclic patterns of blood-stage
      parasite growth in all volunteers. The parasite multiplication rates for both
      studies was 8.18 (95% CI = 6.162 to 10.20). Data showed that at low parasite
      densities, a combination of sequestration and stochastic effects of low copy
      number DNA may impact qPCR detection and the parasite detection limit.
      CONCLUSION: Smear positive is an endpoint which antimalarial rescue is imperative
      whereas early detection of parasitological data by qPCR can allow for better
      anticipation of the endpoint. This would allow for early treatment to reduce
      clinical illness and risk for study participants. To use qPCR as the primary
      endpoint in CHMI trials, an algorithm of two positives by qPCR where one of the
      positives must have parasite density of at least 2 parasites/muL is proposed.

      India.
PG  - 284
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in India has
      historically travelled from northeast India along the Myanmar border. The
      treatment policy for P. falciparum in the region was, therefore, changed from
      chloroquine to artesunate (AS) plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in selected
      areas in 2005 and in 2008 it became the first-line treatment. Recognizing that
      resistance to the partner drug can limit the useful life of this combination
      therapy, routine in vivo and molecular monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy 
      through sentinel sites was initiated in 2009. METHODS: Between May and October
      2012, 190 subjects with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled in
      therapeutic efficacy studies in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, and
      Mizoram. Clinical and parasitological assessments were conducted over 42 days of 
      follow-up. Multivariate analysis was used to determine risk factors associated
      with treatment failure. Genotyping was done to distinguish re-infection from
      recrudescence as well as to determine the prevalence of molecular markers of
      antifolate resistance among isolates. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients completed 
      42 days of follow-up at three sites. The crude and PCR-corrected Kaplan-Meier
      survival estimates of AS + SP were 60.8% (95% CI: 48.0-71.4) and 76.6% (95% CI:
      64.1-85.2) in Gomati, Tripura; 74.6% (95% CI: 62.0-83.6) and 81.7% (95% CI:
      69.4-89.5) in Lunglei, Mizoram; and, 59.5% (95% CI: 42.0-73.2) and 82.3% (95% CI:
      64.6-91.6) in Changlang, Arunachal Pradesh. Most patients with P. falciparum
      cleared parasitaemia within 24 hours of treatment, but eight, including three
      patients who failed treatment, remained parasitaemic on day 3. Risk factors
      associated with treatment failure included age < five years, fever at the time of
      enrolment and AS under dosing. No adverse events were reported. Presence of dhfr 
      plus dhps quintuple mutation was observed predominantly in treatment failure
      samples. CONCLUSION: AS + SP treatment failure was widespread in northeast India 
      and exceeded the threshold for changing drug policy. Based on these results, in
      January 2013 the expert committee of the National Vector Borne Disease Control
      Programme formulated the first subnational drug policy for India and selected
      artemether plus lumefantrine as the new first-line treatment in the northeast.
      Continued monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy is essential for effective
      malaria control.

      and recommendations for accurate reporting.
PG  - 283
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-283 [doi]
AB  - Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a critical role in malaria case
      management, surveillance and case investigations. Test performance is largely
      determined by design and quality characteristics, such as detection sensitivity, 
      specificity, and thermal stability. However, parasite characteristics such as
      variable or absent expression of antigens targeted by RDTs can also affect RDT
      performance. Plasmodium falciparum parasites lacking the PfHRP2 protein, the most
      common target antigen for detection of P. falciparum, have been reported in some 
      regions. Therefore, accurately mapping the presence and prevalence of P.
      falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 would be an important step so that RDTs
      targeting alternative antigens, or microscopy, can be preferentially selected for
      use in such regions. Herein the available evidence and molecular basis for
      identifying malaria parasites lacking PfHRP2 is reviewed, and a set of
      recommended procedures to apply for future investigations for parasites lacking
      PfHRP2, is proposed.

AB  - Malaria is largely a preventable and curable disease. However, a delay or an
      inappropriate treatment can result in serious adverse outcomes for patient.
      Rapid, simple and cost-effective diagnostic tests that can be easily adapted and 
      rapidly scaled-up at the field or community levels are needed. In this study,
      accelerated detection methods for the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium
      vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase were developed based on
      the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. The developed methods
      included the use of species-specific biotinylated primers to amplify LAMP
      amplicons, which were then hybridized to specific FITC-labeled DNA probes and
      visualized on a chromatographic lateral flow dipstick (LFD). The total LAMP-LFD
      assay time was approximately 1.5h. The LAMP-LFD assays showed similar detection
      limit to conventional PCR assay when performed on plasmid DNA carrying the
      malaria dhfr-ts genes. The LAMP-LFD showed 10 folds higher detection limit than
      PCR when performed on genomic DNA samples from Pf and Pv parasites. The dhfr-ts
      LAMP-LFD assays also have the advantages of reduced assay time and easy format
      for interpretation of results.

AB  - Present study reports the prevalence and distribution of pfcrt K76T and mdr1 N86Y
      mutations in malaria endemic areas of Sonitpur district of Assam. Out of 163
      individuals tested for malaria, 67 (SPR = 41.1 %) were detected positive for
      malaria infection using rapid detection kit in the field and PCR assay in the
      laboratory. Nested PCR-RFLP assay was used to amplify pfcrt K76T and mdr1 N86Y
      genes flanking the K76T and N86Y mutations. P. falciparum was most abundant
      (91.04 %) among the three Plasmodium species reported and its prevalence was
      significantly higher as compared to P. vivax and P. malariae (chi(2) = 150.76; p 
      </= 0.0001; df = 2). Malaria was equally distributed among all the age groups and
      both the sexes. Hemoglobin contents in severe anaemic patients had a significant 
      linear decreasing trend among patients with the increase in age (chi(2) = 4.33; p
      = 0.03), whereas non severe anaemic patients exhibited significant linear
      increasing trend among the patients with the increase in age (chi(2) = 18.38; p
      </= 0.0001). Pfcrt K76T mutation was recorded in 44 (72.13 %) isolates, whereas
      mdr1 N86Y mutation could be detected in 28 (41.79 %) isolates only. Only 32.7 %
      of the samples had both pfcrt K76T and mdr N86Y mutations. Number of pfcrt K76T
      mutant isolates was significantly higher than the wild type. However no
      significant difference was observed among the number of isolates with mdr1 N86Y
      mutant and wild isolates.

      Anopheles mosquitoes.

AB  - The Toll and IMD pathways are known to be induced upon Plasmodium berghei and
      Plasmodium falciparum infection, respectively. It is unclear how Plasmodium or
      other pathogens in the blood meal and their invasion of the midgut epithelium
      would trigger the innate immune responses in immune cells, in particular
      hemocytes. Gap junctions, which can mediate both cell-to-cell and
      cell-to-extracellular communication, may participate in this signal transduction.
      This study examined whether innexins, gap junction proteins in insects, are
      involved in anti-Plasmodium responses in Anopheles gambiae. Inhibitor studies
      using carbenoxolone indicated that blocking innexons resulted in an increase in
      Plasmodium oocyst number and infection prevalence. This was accompanied by a
      decline in TEP1 levels in carbenoxolone-treated mosquitoes. Innexin AGAP001476
      mRNA levels in midguts were induced during Plasmodium infection and a knockdown
      of AGAP001476, but not AGAP006241, caused an induction in oocyst number.
      Silencing AGAP001476 caused a concurrent increase in vitellogenin levels, a TEP1 
      inhibitor, in addition to a reduced level of TEP1-LRIM1-APL1C complex in
      hemolymph. Both vitellogenin and TEP1 are regulated by Cactus under the Toll
      pathway. Simultaneous knockdown of cactus and AGAP001476 failed to reverse the
      near refractoriness induced by the knockdown of cactus, suggesting that the
      AGAP001476-mediated anti-Plasmodium response is Cactus-dependent. These data
      demonstrate a critical role for innexin AGAP001476 in mediating innate immune
      responses against Plasmodium through Toll pathway in mosquitoes.

AB  - The most severe form of malaria is cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium
      falciparum. Standard malaria diagnosis is Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear
      but false negative findings are always reported. Moreover, mixed infections are
      underestimated by routine microscopy. Many methods have been developed to
      overcome these disadvantages and the most specific and sensitive is molecular
      diagnosis. Specific malaria genes are amplified by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and many post-PCR methods have been created. We developed a gold fabricated
      quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as a post-PCR method of malaria diagnosis. In
      this work a cheaper silver fabricated QCM was developed to identify both single
      and mixed infection of P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The biotinylated
      malaria probe was immobilized on silver surface via specific avidin-biotin
      interaction. The target DNA fragment of 18s rRNA gene was amplified and
      hybridized with a QCM immobilized probe. Mass changes due to DNA hybridization
      were indicated by changes of quartz resonance frequencies. Validation showed that
      malaria silver QCM had high diagnostic potency. Evaluation of suspected 67
      febrile blood samples from malaria endemic area demonstrated that the malaria
      silver QCM could identify both false negative and misdiagnosis cases of routine
      microscopy. The analysis cost of malaria silver QCM was $1/sample and analysis
      time was 30 min after blood collection. The malaria silver QCM is stable at
      tropical temperature for up to 6 months. Thus, it can be transported to be used
      in a remote endemic area. Thus, the malaria silver QCM is accurate, precise,
      rapid, cheap, and field applicable.

      naturally exposed to malaria.

AB  - Malaria remains one of the most prevalent and lethal human infectious diseases
      worldwide. A comprehensive characterization of antibody responses to blood stage 
      malaria is essential to support the development of future vaccines,
      sero-diagnostic tests, and sero-surveillance methods. We constructed a proteome
      array containing 4441 recombinant proteins expressed by the blood stages of the
      two most common human malaria parasites, P. falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv),
      and used this array to screen sera of Papua New Guinea children infected with Pf,
      Pv, or both (Pf/Pv) that were either symptomatic (febrile), or asymptomatic but
      had parasitemia detectable via microscopy or PCR. We hypothesized that
      asymptomatic children would develop antigen-specific antibody profiles associated
      with antidisease immunity, as compared with symptomatic children. The sera from
      these children recognized hundreds of the arrayed recombinant Pf and Pv proteins.
      In general, responses in asymptomatic children were highest in those with high
      parasitemia, suggesting that antibody levels are associated with parasite burden.
      In contrast, symptomatic children carried fewer antibodies than asymptomatic
      children with infections detectable by microscopy, particularly in Pv and Pf/Pv
      groups, suggesting that antibody production may be impaired during symptomatic
      infections. We used machine-learning algorithms to investigate the relationship
      between antibody responses and symptoms, and we identified antibody responses to 
      sets of Plasmodium proteins that could predict clinical status of the donors.
      Several of these antibody responses were identified by multiple comparisons,
      including those against members of the serine enriched repeat antigen family and 
      merozoite protein 4. Interestingly, both P. falciparum serine enriched repeat
      antigen-5 and merozoite protein 4 have been previously investigated for use in
      vaccines. This machine learning approach, never previously applied to proteome
      arrays, can be used to generate a list of potential seroprotective and/or
      diagnostic antigens candidates that can be further evaluated in longitudinal
      studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to limitation of conventional malaria diagnostics, including
      microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA), alternative accurate diagnostics have been demanded for
      improvement of sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: Serially diluted Plasmodium 
      LDH antigens, Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells (RBC) derived 
      from in vitro culture or patient's samples were used for evaluation of the
      performance of fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA). Microscopic
      examination was used to determine parasite density and the performance of FLISA
      was compared to ELISA. Finally, sensitivity and specificity of FLISA was
      determined by human specimens infected with P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax,
      Toxoplasma gondii, and amoebae. RESULTS: As a result of FLISA, the fluorescent
      intensity was highly correlated with antigen amount and FLISA was more sensitive 
      than ELISA. FLISA detected at least 0.01 ng/ml of pLDH antigen, which showed
      1,000-fold higher sensitivity than ELISA. In vitro-cultured P. falciparum was
      detected up to 20 parasite number/muL in FLISA but 5120 parasite number/muLin
      sandwich ELISA. In vitro P. falciparum-infected RBC number was highly correlated 
      with fluorescent intensity (R2 = 0.979), showing that FLISA was reliable for
      detection of P. falciparum and available for quantification of parasite numbers. 
      Furthermore, eighteen patient samples infected with P. falciparum (n = 9) and P. 
      vivax (n = 9) showed 100% of sensitivity (18/18). FLISA showed 96.3% of
      specificity (26/27) because one sample of patient blood infected with T. gondii
      gave a false positive reactivity among healthy donors (n = 9), T. gondii-infected
      patients (n = 9), and amoeba-infected patients (n = 9). CONCLUSION: FLISA has a
      keen and high performance to detect malaria antigen, suggesting a potential assay
      as malaria immunodiagnostic.

      and their relation to disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human malaria is still a burden in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces 
      in south-central Vietnam that border Cambodia. Several Anopheles species that
      transmit human malarial Plasmodium may also transmit Wuchereria bancrofti, the
      nematode that causes Bancroftian lymphatic filariasis. The objective of this
      study was to investigate the role of Anopheles species in the transmission of
      these two pathogens in the two highly malaria endemic provinces of Vietnam.
      METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces
      in November and December of 2010 and 2011. Human landing catches, paired
      collections on human and buffalo, and resting captures were made with mouth
      aspirators. Collections were also made with light traps. Morphological and
      PCR-based methods were used to identify the species. Real-time PCR was used to
      detect Plasmodium species and W. bancrofti in individual mosquitoes. RESULTS:
      Twenty-four Anopheles species were identified among 797 captured mosquitoes.
      Anopheles dirus was found in both provinces and was the predominant species in
      Binh Phuoc Province; An. maculatus was the most prevalent species in Dak Nong
      Province. Anopheles minimus was collected only in Binh Phuoc Province. Some
      specimens of An. minimus and An. pampanai were misidentified based on morphology.
      Four specimens of An. scanloni were identified, and this is the first report of
      this species of the Dirus Complex in Vietnam. Two females, one An. dirus and one 
      An. pampanai, collected in Binh Phuoc Province were infected with P. vivax, for
      an overall infection rate of 0.41% (2/486): 0.28% for An. dirus (1/361) and 20%
      for An. pampanai (1/5). No mosquitoes were found to be infected with P.
      falciparum, P. knowlesi or W. bancrofti in either province. CONCLUSION: A
      diversity of Anopheles species occurs in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces of
      Vietnam, several of which are considered to be actual and potential vectors of
      malarial protozoa and microfilariae. It is highly likely that two of the species,
      An. dirus and An. pampanai, are active in malaria transmission based on the
      detection of P. vivax in females of these species. This is the first report of
      An. scanloni in Vietnam.

      multidrug resistance protein-1 gene polymorphisms in Tanzania.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to anti-malarials is a major public health problem
      worldwide. After deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) there 
      have been reports of reduced sensitivity to ACT by malaria parasites in
      South-East Asia. In Tanzania, artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is the recommended
      first-line drug in treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This study surveyed the
      distribution of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein-1 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased parasite tolerance to
      ALu, in Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 687 Plasmodium falciparum positive dried
      blood spots on filter paper and rapid diagnostic test strips collected by finger 
      pricks from patients attending health facilities in six regions of Tanzania
      mainland between June 2010 and August 2011 were used. Polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used
      to detect Pfmdr1 SNPs N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y. RESULTS: There were variations in
      the distribution of Pfmdr1 polymorphisms among regions. Tanga region had
      exceptionally high prevalence of mutant alleles, while Mbeya had the highest
      prevalence of wild type alleles. The haplotype YFY was exclusively most prevalent
      in Tanga (29.6%) whereas the NYD haplotype was the most prevalent in all other
      regions. Excluding Tanga and Mbeya, four, most common Pfmdr1 haplotypes did not
      vary between the remaining four regions (chi(2) = 2.3, p = 0.512). The NFD
      haplotype was the second most prevalent haplotype in all regions, ranging from
      17% - 26%. CONCLUSION: This is the first country-wide survey on Pfmdr1 mutations 
      associated with ACT resistance. Distribution of individual Pfmdr1 mutations at
      codons 86, 184 and 1246 varies throughout Tanzanian regions. There is a general
      homogeneity in distribution of common Pfmdr1 haplotypes reflecting strict
      implementation of ALu policy in Tanzania with overall prevalence of NFD haplotype
      ranging from 17 to 26% among other haplotypes. With continuation of ALu as
      first-line drug this haplotype is expected to keep rising, thus there is need for
      continued pharmacovigilance studies to monitor any delayed parasite clearance by 
      the drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests play a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of 
      malaria where microscopy or polymerase chain reaction are not immediately
      available. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 39 year old traveler to
      Canada who presented with fever, headache, and abdominal pain after visiting
      friends and relatives in India. While in India, the individual was not ill and
      had no signs or symptoms of malaria. Laboratory testing upon his return to Canada
      identified a false positive malaria rapid diagnostic (BinaxNOW(R) malaria) result
      for P. falciparum with coincident Salmonella Typhi bacteraemia without rheumatoid
      or autoimmune factors. Rapid diagnostic test false positivity for malaria
      coincided with the presence or absence of Salmonella Typhi in the blood.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that Salmonella Typhi infection may
      result in a false positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. The mechanism of this
      cross-reactivity is not clear.

PG  - 5528-36
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02682-14 [doi]
AB  - An open-label, randomized controlled trial was carried out in 2011-2012 in the
      Democratic Republic of the Congo to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of the artemisinin-based combination treatments dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine,
      amodiaquine-artesunate, and artemether-lumefantrine. Six hundred eighty-four
      children aged 3 to 59 months with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      were randomly allocated to each study arm. Children were hospitalized for 3 days,
      given supervised treatment, and followed up weekly for 42 days. All regimens were
      well tolerated and rapidly effective. The median parasitemia clearance half-life 
      was 2.2 h, and half-lives were similar between arms (P=0.19). The PCR-uncorrected
      cure rates by day 42 were 73.0% for amodiaquine-artesunate, 70.2% for
      artemether-lumefantrine, and 86.3% for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (P=0.001). 
      Early treatment failure occurred in three patients (0.5%), one in each arm. The
      PCR-corrected cure rates were 93.4% for amodiaquine-artesunate, 92.7% for
      artemether-lumefantrine, and 94.3% for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (P=0.78).
      The last provided a longer posttreatment prophylactic effect than did the other
      two treatments. The day 7 plasma concentration of piperaquine was below 30 ng/ml 
      in 47% of the children treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and the day 7
      lumefantrine concentration was below 280 ng/ml in 37.0% of children who received 
      artemether-lumefantrine. Thus, although cure rates were all satisfactory, they
      could be improved by increasing the dose. (This study has been registered with

TI  - Quantification of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 in cerebrospinal

AB  - A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for cerebral malaria (CM) has not been
      validated. We examined the detection, semiquantification, and clinical use of the
      Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) as a parasite antigen
      biomarker for CM. The PfHRP-2 was detected in archival CSF samples from CM
      patients from Tanzania both by a newly developed sensitive and specific
      immuno-polymerase chain reaction (72 of 73) and by rapid diagnostic tests (62 of 
      73). The geometric mean PfHRP-2 CSF concentration was 8.76 ng/mL with no
      differences in those who survived (9.2 ng/mL), those who died (11.1 ng/mL), and
      those with neurologic sequelae (10.8 ng/mL). All aparasitemic endemic and
      nonendemic control samples had undetectable CSF PfHRP-2. In a separate group of
      11 matched plasma and CSF cerebral malaria patient samples, the ratio of plasma
      to CSF PfHRP-2 was 175. The CSF PfHRP-2 reflects elevated plasma PfHRP-2 rather
      than elevated CM-specific CSF ratios, falling short of a validated biomarker.

TI  - Use of proscribed chloroquine is associated with an increased risk of pfcrt T76
      mutation in some parts of Ghana.
PG  - 246
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After years of disuse of chloroquine (CQ) as first-line anti-malarial
      drug in Ghana, reports from molecular studies conducted in parts of the country
      indicate varying prevalence of T76 mutation in the pfcrt gene. This situation has
      several health implications, one being that mutations that confer resistance to
      CQ have been reported to show substantial cross-resistance to other anti-malarial
      drugs. It is important to identify some of the factors contributing to the
      continuous presence of CQ resistance markers in the country. This study
      determined the prevalence of T76 mutation in pfcrt gene of Plasmodium falciparum 
      isolates collected from selected areas of the Central region of Ghana and
      correlated with the level of CQ use in these areas. METHODS: Plasmodium
      falciparum DNA was extracted from collected blood-blot filter paper samples in
      the study sites. The prevalence of T76 point mutation in pfcrt gene was assessed 
      using nested PCR followed by RFLP. CQ from pharmacy and chemical shops was
      obtained using mystery buying method. The extent of CQ use by the participants
      was determined by measuring the level of the drug in their urine samples using
      the Saker-Solomon method. RESULTS: Of the 214 P. falciparum isolates analysed,
      71.9% were found to have T76 mutation of pfcrt gene. The study revealed that
      14.49% of community pharmacies and chemical shops had stocks of CQ for sale while
      16.9% of the participants had CQ in their urine samples. There is five times more
      risks of becoming infected with CQ resistant strain for staying in an area where 
      CQ is stocked for sale [RR = 0.20, p < 0.0001] and thirteen times more risks of
      having CQ-resistant mutant from those who still use CQ than non-users [OR = 0.08,
      p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that high variation in the
      prevalence of T76 mutations of P. falciparum is linked with the level of CQ
      stocking and usage within study area.

TI  - Effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      during pregnancy on placental malaria, maternal anaemia and birthweight in areas 
      with high and low malaria transmission intensity in Tanzania.
PG  - 1048-56
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12349 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of IPTp in two areas with different
      malaria transmission intensities. METHODS: Prospective observational study
      recruiting pregnant women in two health facilities in areas with high and low
      malaria transmission intensities. A structured questionnaire was used for
      interview. Maternal clinic cards and medical logs were assessed to determine drug
      intake. Placental parasitaemia was screened using both light microscopy and
      real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Of 350 pregnant women were recruited and
      screened for placental parasitaemia, 175 from each area. Prevalence of placental 
      parasitaemia was 16.6% (CI 11.4-22.9) in the high transmission area and 2.3% (CI 
      0.6-5.7) in the low transmission area. Being primigravida and residing in a high 
      transmission area were significant risk factors for placental malaria (OR 2.4; CI
      1.1-5.0; P = 0.025) and (OR 9.4; CI 3.2-27.7; P < 0.001), respectively. IPTp was 
      associated with a lower risk of placental malaria (OR 0.3; CI 0.1-1.0; P =
      0.044); the effect was more pronounced in the high transmission area (OR 0.2; CI 
      0.06-0.7; P = 0.015) than in the low transmission area (OR 0.4; CI 0.04-4.5; P = 
      0.478). IPTp use was not associated with reduced risk of maternal anaemia or low 
      birthweight, regardless of transmission intensity. The number needed to treat
      (NNT) was four (CI 2-6) women in the high transmission area and 33 (20-50) in the
      low transmission area to prevent one case of placental malaria. CONCLUSION: IPTp 
      may have an effect on lowering the risk of placental malaria in areas of high
      transmission, but this effect did not translate into a benefit on risks of
      maternal anaemia or low birthweight. The NNT needs to be considered, and weighted
      against that of other protective measures, eventually targeting areas which are
      above a certain threshold of malaria transmission to maximise the benefit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imported malaria is a major threat to neighboring malaria-eliminating
      countries such as P.R. China and is difficult to monitor. A molecular survey of
      febrile patients with a history of traveling abroad along the Myanmar-China
      endemic border areas from January 2008 to August 2012 was carried out. The rates 
      of infection with species of Plasmodium and compliance of microscopy diagnosis
      with nested PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) results were calculated. RESULTS:
      Plasmodium genus-specific nested PCR confirmed that 384 cases were positive.
      Further species-specific nested PCR showed that the rate of Plasmodium vivax
      infection was 55% (213/384); that of Plasmodium falciparum was 21% (81/384) and
      17% (67/384) of cases were co-infection cases of P. vivax and P. falciparum; the 
      remaining 6% (23/384) of cases were caused by other species, such as Plasmodium
      ovale, P. malaria, P. knowlesi or mixed infections of Plasmodium. In total there 
      was 13% (50/384) false microscopy diagnosis including 6% (22/384) error in
      species diagnosis and 7% (28/384) undiagnosed cases in co-infection or low
      parasitemia malaria cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that there are
      considerable numbers of malaria cases in the China-Myanmar endemic border areas
      that remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed by microscopy, especially in low-level
      and/or complex co-infection cases. It is urgent to develop accurate rapid
      diagnostic tests and apply PCR confirmation for efficient surveillance.

AB  - Control and eradication of malaria is hindered by the acquisition of drug
      resistance by Plasmodium species. This has necessitated a persistent search for
      novel drugs and more efficient targets. Plasmodium species specific lactate
      dehydrogenase is one of the potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets, because
      of its indispensable role in endoerythrocytic stage of the parasite. A target
      molecule that is highly conserved in the parasite population can be more
      effectively used in diagnostics and therapeutics, hence, in the present study
      polymorphism in PfLDH (Plasmodiumfalciparum specific LDH) and PvLDH
      (Plasmodiumvivax specific LDH) genes was analyzed using PCR-single strand
      confirmation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. Forty-six P. falciparum and 
      thirty-five P. vivax samples were screened from different states of India. Our
      findings have revealed presence of a single PfLDH genotype and six PvLDH
      genotypes among the studied samples. Interestingly, along with synonymous
      substitutions, nonsynonymous substitutions were reported to be present for the
      first time in the PvLDH genotypes. Further, through amino acid sequence alignment
      and homology modeling studies we observed that the catalytic residues were
      conserved in all PvLDH genotypes and the nonsynonymous substitutions have not
      altered the enzyme structure significantly. Evolutionary genetics studies have
      confirmed that PfLDH and PvLDH loci are under strong purifying selection.
      Phylogenetic analysis of the pLDH gene sequences revealed that P. falciparum
      compared to P. vivax, has recent origin. The study therefore supports PfLDH and
      PvLDH as suitable therapeutic and diagnostic targets as well as phylogenetic
      markers to understand the genealogy of malaria species.

AB  - The role of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      transmission among infants early in life remain elusive. We hypothesized that
      infection with malaria during pregnancy could cause EBV reactivation leading to
      high EBV load in circulation, which could subsequently enhance early age of EBV
      infection. Pregnant women in Kisumu, where P. falciparum malaria is holoendemic, 
      were actively followed monthly through antenatal visits (up to 4 per mother) and 
      delivery. Using real-time quantitative (Q)-PCR, we quantified and compared EBV
      and P. falciparum DNA levels in the blood of pregnant women with and without P.
      falciparum malaria. Pregnant women that had malaria detected during pregnancy
      were more likely to have detectable EBV DNA than pregnant women who had no
      evidence of malaria infection during pregnancy (64 vs. 36 %, p = 0.01). EBV load 
      as analyzed by quantifying area under the longitudinal observation curve (AUC)
      was significantly higher in pregnant women with P. falciparum malaria than in
      women without evidence of malaria infection (p = 0.01) regardless of gestational 
      age of pregnancy. Increase in malaria load correlated with increase in EBV load
      (p < 0.0001). EBV load was higher in third trimester (p = 0.04) than first and
      second trimester of pregnancy independent of known infections. Significantly
      higher frequency and elevated EBV loads were found in pregnant women with malaria
      than in women without evidence of P. falciparum infection during pregnancy. The
      loss of control of EBV latency following P. falciparum infection during pregnancy
      and subsequent increase in EBV load in circulation could contribute to enhanced
      shedding of EBV in maternal saliva and breast milk postpartum, but further
      studies are needed.

TI  - Prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and its association
      with Plasmodium falciparum infection among children in Iganga distric in Uganda.
PG  - 372
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-7-372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a metabolic enzyme
      involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, its especially important in red blood 
      cell metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked
      recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of G6PD.
      About 400 million people worldwide have a deficiency of this enzyme. The
      remarkable geographic correlation of G6PD deficiency distribution with historical
      endemicity patterns of malaria has led to suggestions that the two could be
      linked. Some studies have concluded that G6PD deficiency confers resistance to
      malaria. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, and determine
      its relationship with prevalence and incidence of P. falciparum infection among
      children in Uganda. METHODS: This was longitudinal study involving 245 children, 
      135 were actively followed up for 12 months. G6PD status was assessed for using
      PCR-RFLP method. A thick smear was done to determine presence of plasmodium
      trophozoites and parasite densities. RESULTS: A total of 245 children between 6
      months and 9 years were recruited. Of these 46.5% were males. Overall prevalence 
      for the X-linked G6PD A- mutation was; 79.59% wild type, 12.65% heterozygous and 
      7.76% homozygous or hemizygous. Among the males 14% were hemizygous. At baseline,
      40.8% had asymptomatic P falciparum infection. There was no statistically
      significant difference in prevalence and incidence rates of malaria infection
      among the different G6PD genotypes with prevalence among heterozygous,
      homozygous, and wild type being 29%, 42.6% and 43% respectively (p = 0.11) and
      incidence among heterozygous and wild type being 0.56 and 0.52 episodes/year (p =
      0.5). The heterozygous G6PD A- females had a lower parasite density compared to
      the wild type (2505 vs 941 parasites/muL; P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that 20.41% of the population in this part of Uganda carry the G6PD
      A-mutation, within the range of 15-32% seen in other parts of Africa. P.
      falciparum infection incidence and prevalence rates are similar among the G6PD
      genotypes though, once infected, P. falciparum parasite densities are lowest
      among G6PD A- heterozygous females. This suggests differences in P. falciparum
      infection rates and severity of disease could be mediated by differences in
      parasite densities among the different G6PD genotypes.

AB  - Clonally variant protein expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
      generates phenotypic variability and allows isogenic populations to adapt to
      environmental changes encountered during blood stage infection. The underlying
      regulatory mechanisms are best studied for the major virulence factor P.
      falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 is encoded by the
      multicopy var gene family and only a single variant is expressed in individual
      parasites, a concept known as mutual exclusion or singular gene choice. var gene 
      activation occurs in situ and is achieved through the escape of one locus from
      epigenetic silencing. Singular gene choice is controlled at the level of
      transcription initiation and var 5' upstream (ups) sequences harbour regulatory
      information essential for mutually exclusive transcription as well as for the
      trans-generational inheritance of the var activity profile. An additional level
      of control has recently been identified for the var2csa gene, where an mRNA
      element in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) is involved in the reversible
      inhibition of translation of var2csa transcripts. Here, we extend the knowledge
      on post-transcriptional var gene regulation to the common upsC type. We
      identified a 5' UTR sequence that inhibits translation of upsC-derived mRNAs.
      Importantly, this 5' UTR element efficiently inhibits translation even in the
      context of a heterologous upstream region. Further, we found var 5' UTRs to be
      significantly enriched in uAUGs which are known to impair the efficiency of
      protein translation in other eukaryotes. Our findings suggest that regulation at 
      the post-transcriptional level is a common feature in the control of PfEMP1
      expression in P. falciparum.

AB  - Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are a group of natural killer
      cell receptors (NKRs) that regulate NK-cell-mediated production of interferon
      gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to infection. These receptors have recently been
      suggested to influence the severity of clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      infection. We examined the KIR locus in relation to malaria in children from
      southwest Nigeria. Sequence specific priming (SSP)-PCR was used to detect the KIR
      genes. The presence or absence of fifteen different KIR genes was determined in
      each individual and the proportions compared across 3 clinical groups;
      asymptomatic malaria, uncomplicated clinical malaria and severe clinical malaria.
      The genes KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3 and KIR2DS5 were present in a significantly higher
      proportion of individuals in the asymptomatic control group than in the malaria
      cases. Furthermore, KIR2DS3 and KIR2DS5 were present in a higher proportion of
      uncomplicated malaria cases than severe malaria cases. Carriage c-AB2 genotype
      (which comprises all centromeric KIR genes including KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3 and
      KIR2DS5) decreases with severity of the disease suggesting that the KIR AB
      profile might be associated with protection from severe malaria infection in this
      population in Nigeria.

TI  - Pfcrt mutant haplotypes may not correspond with chloroquine resistance.
PG  - 768-73
LID - 10.3855/jidc.3398 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is associated with 
      mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes. The frequency distribution of pfcrt K76T and
      pfmdr1 N86Y mutations and their association with chloroquine susceptibility was
      studied in an endemic area along the Indo-Bangladesh border. METHODOLOGY: A
      single-arm prospective study of clinical and parasitological responses in P.
      falciparum malaria patients to chloroquine was conducted in vivo. PCR-RFLP assay 
      was used to detect pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y mutations in P. falciparum. The PCR
      products of pfcrt gene were sequenced, translated and aligned for haplotyping.
      RESULTS: Out of 63 cases, 44 (69.8%) responded adequately to chloroquine
      treatment. Pfcrt K76T mutation was recorded in 100% of the treatment failure
      cases, whereas pfmdr1 N86Y mutation was found in 52.6% of the cases only. Early
      treatment failure (84.2%) occurred more frequently than late treatment failure
      (15.8%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the probability estimate for 
      treatment success after 7 and 15 days was 0.84 (95% CI = 0.72-0.92) and 0.70 (95%
      CI = 0.57-0.80), respectively. Sequence analysis of 72 to 76 pfcrt gene codons
      revealed the presence of two mutant (CVMNT, CVIET) and two wild (CVMNK, CVIEK)
      haplotypes. The mutant CVIET haplotype was predominantly distributed (42.1%).
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mutations in pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y genes is not
      sufficient to explain the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine to P. falciparum.
      Study suggests that pfcrt K76T mutant haplotypes are widely distributed and are
      spreading diligently, which needs to be taken into account in devising an
      antimalarial policy.

TI  - Efficacy of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment of
      malaria in pregnancy, Mansa, Zambia.
PG  - 227
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) decreases adverse effects of malaria during
      pregnancy. Zambia implemented its IPTp-SP programme in 2003. Emergence of
      SP-resistant Plasmodium falciparum threatens this strategy. The quintuple mutant 
      haplotype (substitutions in N51I, C59R, S108N in dhfr and A437G and K540E in dhps
      genes), is associated with SP treatment failure in non-pregnant patients with
      malaria. This study examined efficacy of IPTp-SP and presence of the quintuple
      mutant among pregnant women in Mansa, Zambia. METHODS: In Mansa, an area with
      high malaria transmission, HIV-negative pregnant women presenting to two
      antenatal clinics for the 1st dose of IPTp-SP with asymptomatic parasitaemia were
      enrolled and microscopy for parasitaemia was done weekly for five weeks. Outcomes
      were parasitological failure and adequate parasitological response (no
      parasitaemia during follow-up). Polymerase chain reaction assays were employed to
      distinguish recrudescence from reinfection, and identify molecular markers of SP 
      resistance. Survival analysis included those who had reinfection and incomplete
      follow-up (missed at least one follow-up). RESULTS: Of the 109 women included in 
      the study, 58 (53%) completed all follow-up, 34 (31%) had incomplete follow-up,
      and 17 (16%) were lost to follow-up after day 0. Of those who had complete
      follow-up, 15 (26%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [16-38]) had parasitological
      failure. For the 92 women included in the survival analysis, median age was 20
      years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-22), median gestational age was 22 weeks (IQR
      range 20-24), and 57% were primigravid. There was no difference in time to
      failure in primigravid versus multigravid women. Of the 84 women with complete
      haplotype data for the aforementioned loci of the dhfr and dhps genes, 53 (63%,
      95% CI [50-70]) had quintuple mutants (two with an additional mutation in A581G
      of dhps). Among women with complete follow-up and quintuple mutants, 22% had
      parasitological failure versus 0% without (p = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: While
      underpowered, this study found 26% failure rates of SP given the moderate
      prevalence of the quintuple mutant haplotype. Despite the presence of resistance,
      SP retained some efficacy in clearing parasites in pregnant women, and may remain
      a viable option for IPTp in Zambia.

LID - 10.1093/trstmh/tru084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies comparing multiple methods for DNA extraction from dried 
      blood spots (DBS) on filter paper for PCR targeting the Plasmodium genome have
      been done. METHODS: Frequently-used methods for DNA extraction from DBS using
      Chelex-100, InstaGene Matrix, QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and TE buffer were compared on 
      a dilution series of a standardized Plasmodium falciparum positive sample. The
      two DNA extraction methods resulting in the lowest limits of detection were
      compared by testing both on 31 P. falciparum positive samples collected under
      field conditions and stored for 4 years. RESULTS: The Chelex-100, InstaGene
      Matrix and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit methods performed similarly, resulting in the
      detection of 0.5 to 2 parasites per microliter (p/microl). The same 13 clinical
      samples (13/31; 42%) were positive using both DNA extraction methods with the
      lowest limits of detection. CONCLUSIONS: Simple and low-cost methods can be
      sensitive and useful in extracting DNA from DBS. Poor results on stored clinical 
      DBS indicate that further studies on the impact of storage duration and
      conditions, and choice of filter paper should be performed.

      non-endemic region: implications for blood transfusion and malaria epidemiology.
PG  - 224
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, malaria is endemic in the Amazon River basin and
      non-endemic in the extra-Amazon region, which includes areas of Sao Paulo state. 
      In this state, a number of autochthonous cases of malaria occur annually, and the
      prevalence of subclinical infection is unknown. Asymptomatic infections may
      remain undetected, maintaining transmission of the pathogen, including by blood
      transfusion. In these report it has been described subclinical Plasmodium
      infection in blood donors from a blood transfusion centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, representative samples of blood were
      obtained from 1,108 healthy blood donors at the Fundacao Pro-Sangue Hemocentro de
      Sao Paulo, the main blood transfusion centre in Sao Paulo. Malaria exposure was
      defined by the home region (exposed: forest region; non-exposed: non-forest
      region). Real-time PCR was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax. Subclinical malaria cases were geo-referenced. RESULTS: Eighty-four
      (7.41%) blood donors tested positive for Plasmodium; 57 of these were infected by
      P. falciparum, 25 by P. vivax, and 2 by both. The prevalence of P. falciparum and
      P. vivax was 5.14 and 2.26, respectively. The overall prevalence ratio (PR) was
      3.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03, 5.13); P. falciparum PR was 16.11 (95%
      CI 5.87, 44.21) and P. vivax PR was 0.47 (95% CI 0.2, 1.12). Plasmodium
      falciparum subclinical malaria infection in the Atlantic Forest domain was
      present in the mountain regions while P. vivax infection was observed in cities
      from forest-surrounded areas. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Plasmodium in healthy 
      blood donors from a region known as non-endemic, which is important in the
      context of transfusion biosafety, was described. Infected recipients may become
      asymptomatic carriers and a reservoir for parasites, maintaining their
      transmission. Furthermore, P. falciparum PR was positively associated with the
      forest environment, and P. vivax was associated with forest fragmentation.

TI  - Anopheles ziemanni a locally important malaria vector in Ndop health district,
      north west region of Cameroon.
PG  - 262
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission in Cameroon is mediated by a plethora of vectors
      that are heterogeneously distributed across the country depending on the biotope.
      To effectively guide malaria control operations, regular update on the role of
      local Anopheles species is essential. Therefore, an entomological survey was
      conducted between August 2010 and May 2011 to evaluate the role of the local
      anopheline population in malaria transmission in three villages of the Ndop
      health district in the northwest region of Cameroon where malaria is holoendemic,
      as a means to acquiring evidence based data for improved vector intervention.
      METHODS: Mosquitoes were sampled both indoor and outdoor for four consecutive
      nights in each locality during each month of survey. Sampling was done by the
      human landing catch method on volunteers. Anopheles species were identified
      morphologically and their ovaries randomly dissected for parity determination.
      Infection with Plasmodium falciparum was detected by Circumsporozoite protein
      ELISA. Members of An. gambiae complex were further identified to molecular level 
      by PCR and RFLP PCR. RESULTS: An. ziemanni was the main malaria vector and
      whether outdoor or indoor. The man biting rate for the vectors ranged from 6.75
      to 8.29 bites per person per night (b/p/n). The entomological inoculation rate
      for this vector species was 0.0278 infectious bites per person per night (ib/p/n)
      in Mbapishi, 0.034 ib/p/n in Mbafuh, and 0.063 ib/p/n in Backyit. These were by
      far greater than that for An. gambiae. No difference was observed in the parity
      rate of these two vectors. PCR analysis revealed the presence of only An.
      colluzzi (M- form). CONCLUSIONS: An. ziemanni is an important local malaria
      vector in Ndop health district. The findings provide useful baseline information 
      on the anopheles species composition, their distribution and role in malaria
      transmission that would guide the implementation of integrated vector management 
      strategies in the locality.

TI  - Status of allele frequency and diversity of Plasmodium falciparum msp1, msp2 and 
      glurp before implementation of an artemisinin-based combined therapy in
      Northwestern Colombia.
PG  - 208-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The status of msp1, msp2 and glurp allele frequency and the
      diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in Northwestern Colombia before the
      implementation of an artemisinin-combined therapy have been explored only by a
      few authors and in a relatively small number of samples from this highly endemic 
      region. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of msp1, msp2, and glurp alleles and
      the diversity of P. falciparum in two Colombian regions before the use of an
      artemisinin-combined therapy. METHODS: This study was part of a major
      anti-malarial efficacy trial designed as a random, clinically-controlled study
      for which 224 subjects were recruited. Region 2 of msp1 and msp2 (central region)
      were amplified by a nested PCR; glurp (region R2) was amplified by a semi-nested 
      PCR. RESULTS: For msp1, five genotypes were observed, representing the K1, MAD20,
      and RO33 allelic families. All samples corresponded to a MAD20 150 bp allele. For
      msp2 (IC family), two alleles were detected and for glurp, eight were observed. A
      total 33 haplotypes were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of glurpcan be used to
      successfully genotype parasite populations in the new studies in Colombia aimed
      at exploring Plasmodium spp population dynamics. In addition, analysis of msp1
      and msp2 can also be of value for comparisons with past studies, but not when the
      objective is to study parasites obtained from the same patient in a reduced
      period of time; for instance, during treatment efficacy studies.

TI  - Placental malaria is rare among Zanzibari pregnant women who did not receive
      intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy.
PG  - 367-73
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0586 [doi]
AB  - Zanzibar has transitioned from malaria control to the pre-elimination phase, and 
      the continued need for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) 
      has been questioned. We conducted a prospective observational study to estimate
      placental malaria positivity rate among women who did not receive IPTp with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. A convenience sample of pregnant women was enrolled
      from six clinics on the day of delivery from August of 2011 to September of 2012.
      Dried placental blood spot specimens were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR); 9 of 1,349 specimens (0.7%; precision estimate = 0.2-1.1%) were
      PCR-positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Placental infection was detected on both 
      Pemba (N = 3) and Unguja (N = 6). Placental malaria positivity in Zanzibar was
      low, even in the absence of IPTp. It may be reasonable for the Ministry of Health
      to consider discontinuing IPTp, intensifying surveillance efforts, and promoting 
      insecticide-treated nets and effective case management of malaria in pregnancy.

      from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-191 [doi]
AB  - The association between severe malaria and Plasmodium vivax species is
      contentious. On the Thai-Myanmar border, all pregnant women are followed
      systematically with active weekly malaria screening. Over a 27-year period of
      providing antenatal care, 48,983 have been prospectively followed until pregnancy
      outcome (miscarriage or delivery) and 4,298 women have had P. vivax detected at
      least once. Reported here is the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst
      these women. The initial patient presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5%
      parasitaemia) in a term, multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral
      artesunate and mefloquine treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48
      hours. The patient appeared well, was ambulatory and due to be discharged but
      became unwell with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring
      ventilation three days (67 hours) into treatment. Despite induction and delivery 
      of a stillborn foetus, ventilatory requirements increased and the patient died on
      day 7. The patient had a low body mass index. Sensitive detection with nested PCR
      confirmed only the presence of P. vivax species and concomitant infections such
      as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were also ruled out. The
      contemporaneous treatment of acute uncomplicated P. vivax and the onset of ARDS
      on day 3 in this patient implies a possible but unconfirmed association with
      death in this patient. Assuming this death was caused by P. vivax, the risk of
      ARDS-related maternal mortality in this setting did not differ significantly
      between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax (0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) versus 0.23 
      per 1,000 (1/4,298), contrary to the increased risk of maternal mortality from P.
      falciparum compared to P. vivax, 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 
      (1/4,298), P = 0.003.

TI  - Molecular typing reveals substantial Plasmodium vivax infection in asymptomatic
      adults in a rural area of Cameroon.
PG  - 170
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in Cameroon is due to infections by Plasmodium falciparum
      and, to a lesser extent, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale, but rarely
      Plasmodium vivax. A recent report suggested "Plasmodium vivax-like" infections
      around the study area that remained unconfirmed. Therefore, molecular and
      antigenic typing was used to investigate the prevalence of P. vivax and Duffy in 
      asymptomatic adults resident in Bolifamba. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
      conducted from July 2008 to October 2009. The status of all parasite species was 
      determined by nested PCR in 269 blood samples collected. The P. falciparum and P.
      vivax anti-MSP/CSP antibody status of each subject was also determined
      qualitatively by a rapid card assay. Parasite DNA was extracted from a sample
      infected with three parasite species, purified and sequenced. The Duffy antigen
      status of 12 subjects infected with P. vivax was also determined by sequencing.
      In silico web-based tools were used to analyse sequence data for similarities and
      matches to reference sequences in public DNA databases. RESULTS: The overall
      malaria parasite prevalence in 269 individuals was 32.3% (87) as determined by
      PCR. Remarkably, 14.9% (13/87) of infections were caused either exclusively or
      concomitantly by P. vivax, established both by PCR and microscopic examination of
      blood smears, in individuals both positive (50%, 6/12) and negative (50%, 6/12)
      for the Duffy receptor. A triple infection by P. falciparum, P. vivax and P.
      malariae, was detected in one infected individual. Anti-MSP/CSP antibodies were
      detected in 72.1% (194/269) of samples, indicating high and continuous exposure
      to infection through mosquito bites. DISCUSSION: These data provide the first
      molecular evidence of P. vivax in Duffy positive and negative Cameroonians and
      suggest that there may be a significant prevalence of P. vivax infection than
      expected in the study area. Whether the P. vivax cases were imported or due to
      expansion of a founder effect was not investigated. Notwithstanding, the presence
      of P. vivax may complicate control efforts if these parasites become hypnozoitic 
      or latent as the liver stage. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that P.
      vivax is endemic to the south-west region of Cameroon and should be taken into
      account when designing malaria control strategies.

TI  - High proportion of knowlesi malaria in recent malaria cases in Malaysia.
PG  - 168
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian parasite that has been recognized as 
      the fifth species causing human malaria. Naturally-acquired P. knowlesi infection
      is widespread among human populations in Southeast Asia. The aim of this
      epidemiological study was to determine the incidence and distribution of malaria 
      parasites, with a particular focus on human P. knowlesi infection in Malaysia.
      METHODS: A total of 457 microscopically confirmed, malaria-positive blood samples
      were collected from 22 state and main district hospitals in Malaysia between
      September 2012 and December 2013. Nested PCR assay targeting the 18S rRNA gene
      was used to determine the infecting Plasmodium species. RESULTS: A total of 453
      samples were positive for Plasmodium species by using nested PCR assay.
      Plasmodium knowlesi was identified in 256 (56.5%) samples, followed by 133
      (29.4%) cases of Plasmodium vivax, 49 (10.8%) cases of Plasmodium falciparum, two
      (0.4%) cases of Plasmodium ovale and one (0.2%) case of Plasmodium malariae.
      Twelve mixed infections were detected, including P. knowlesi/P. vivax (n = 10),
      P. knowlesi/P. falciparum (n = 1), and P. falciparum/P. vivax (n = 1). Notably,
      P. knowlesi (Included mixed infections involving P. knowlesi (P. knowlesi/P.
      vivax and P. knowlesi /P. falciparum)) showed the highest proportion in Sabah
      (84/115 cases, prevalence of 73.0%), Sarawak (83/120, 69.2%), Kelantan (42/56,
      75.0%), Pahang (24/25, 96.0%), Johor (7/9, 77.8%), and Terengganu (4/5, 80.0%,). 
      In contrast, the rates of P. knowlesi infection in Selangor and Negeri Sembilan
      were found to be 16.2% (18/111 cases) and 50.0% (5/10 cases), respectively.
      Sample of P. knowlesi was not obtained from Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Perak, Pulau
      Pinang, and Perlis during the study period, while a microscopically-positive
      sample from Kedah was negative by PCR. CONCLUSION: In addition to Sabah and
      Sarawak, which have been known for high prevalence of P. knowlesi infection, the 
      findings from this study highlight the widespread distribution of P. knowlesi in 
      many Peninsular Malaysia states.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of mefloquine, administered as a fixed-dose
      combination of artesunate-mefloquine in Indian patients for the treatment of
      acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 187
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed-dose combinations of artemisinin combination therapy are
      strongly recommended to facilitate drug administration and compliance. New
      fixed-dose combinations must nevertheless be evaluated in relevant populations in
      terms of efficacy and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: A single-arm, open-label,
      clinical trial was performed in Indian patients with acute uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria to investigate the efficacy and the
      pharmacokinetics of mefloquine when combined with artesunate in a fixed-dose
      combination (400/200 mg of mefloquine base/artesunate). The pharmacokinetic
      analysis was performed using a population approach. RESULTS: Seventy-seven
      patients were included in the study. Mefloquine pharmacokinetics obeys a
      two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. Mean parameter
      estimates (% inter-individual variability) were as follows: 0.16 h(-1) (75%) for 
      the absorption rate constant, 1.13 L/h (30%) for the apparent plasma clearance,
      271 L (21%) for the apparent central distribution volume, 344 L (54%) for the
      apparent peripheral distribution volume, and 1.43 L/h for the apparent
      distribution clearance. These values were consistent with the pharmacokinetic
      results described in Thai patients. No significant covariate was found for
      clearance. Body weight explained the inter-individual variability of the apparent
      central and peripheral distribution volumes. The PCR-adjusted efficacy of the
      treatment was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant covariate explaining the
      inter-individual variability of mefloquine clearance, combined with the excellent
      efficacy, supports the use of the standard 200/400 mg of artesunate-mefloquine
      fixed-dose combination in Indian patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN70618692.

TI  - Characterization of drug resistance associated genetic polymorphisms among
      Plasmodium falciparum field isolates in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2011, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (ASP), instead of
      chloroquine, has been recommended for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in
      India. In Ujjain, central India, with an annual parasite index <0.1, the
      prevalence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is unknown. In other parts of 
      India chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum is
      prevalent. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-malarial
      drug resistance-associated genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum collected in
      Ujjain in 2009 and 2010, prior to the introduction of ASP. METHODS: Blood samples
      from 87 patients with P. falciparum mono-infection verified by microscopy were
      collected on filter-paper at all nine major pathology laboratories in Ujjain
      city. Codons Pfcrt 72-76, pfmdr1 1034-1246, pfdhfr 16-185, pfdhps 436-632 and
      pfnhe1 ms4760 haplotypes were identified by sequencing. Pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1
      N86Y were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and pfmdr1 gene
      copy number by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
      resistance-associated pfdhfr 108 N and 59R alleles were found in 75/78 (96%) and 
      70/78 (90%) samples, respectively, and pfdhps 437G was found in 7/77 (9%)
      samples. Double mutant pfdhfr 59R + 108 N were found in 62/76 (82%) samples.
      Triple mutant pfdhfr 59R + 108 N and pfdhps 437G were found in 6/76 (8%) samples.
      Chloroquine-resistance-associated pfcrt 76 T was found in 82/87 (94%). The pfcrt 
      72-76 haplotypes found were: 80/84 (95%) SVMNT, 3/84 (4%) CVMNK and 1/84 (1%)
      CVMNT. Pfmdr1 N86 and 86Y were identified in 70/83 (84%) and 13/83 (16%) samples,
      respectively. Pfmdr1 S1034 + N1042 + D1246 were identified together in 70/72
      (97%) of successfully sequenced samples. One pfmdr1 gene copy was found in 74/75 
      (99%) successfully amplified samples. CONCLUSION: This is the first
      characterization of key anti-malarial drug resistance-associated genetic markers 
      among P. falciparum collected in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India. The results
      indicate that the efficacy of standard dose chloroquine at the time of the study 
      was likely to be poor, whereas ASP was likely to be efficacious, supporting the
      changed drug treatment policy. However, P. falciparum with reduced susceptibility
      to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is highly prevalent, highlighting the need for
      continuous surveillance of ASP efficacy in the study area.

TI  - A lab-on-chip for malaria diagnosis and surveillance.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Access to timely and accurate diagnostic tests has a significant
      impact in the management of diseases of global concern such as malaria. While
      molecular diagnostics satisfy this need effectively in developed countries,
      barriers in technology, reagent storage, cost and expertise have hampered the
      introduction of these methods in developing countries. In this study a simple,
      lab-on-chip PCR diagnostic was created for malaria that overcomes these
      challenges. METHODS: The platform consists of a disposable plastic chip and a
      low-cost, portable, real-time PCR machine. The chip contains a desiccated
      hydrogel with reagents needed for Plasmodium specific PCR. Chips can be stored at
      room temperature and used on demand by rehydrating the gel with unprocessed
      blood, avoiding the need for sample preparation. These chips were run on a
      custom-built instrument containing a Peltier element for thermal cycling and a
      laser/camera setup for amplicon detection. RESULTS: This diagnostic was capable
      of detecting all Plasmodium species with a limit of detection for Plasmodium
      falciparum of 2 parasites/muL of blood. This exceeds the sensitivity of
      microscopy, the current standard for diagnosis in the field, by ten to
      fifty-fold. In a blind panel of 188 patient samples from a hyper-endemic region
      of malaria transmission in Uganda, the diagnostic had high sensitivity (97.4%)
      and specificity (93.8%) versus conventional real-time PCR. The test also
      distinguished the two most prevalent malaria species in mixed infections, P.
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A second blind panel of 38 patient samples was
      tested on a streamlined instrument with LED-based excitation, achieving a
      sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      describe the development of a lab-on-chip PCR diagnostic from initial concept to 
      ready-for-manufacture design. This platform will be useful in front-line malaria 
      diagnosis, elimination programmes, and clinical trials. Furthermore, test chips
      can be adapted to detect other pathogens for a differential diagnosis in the
      field. The flexibility, reliability, and robustness of this technology hold much 
      promise for its use as a novel molecular diagnostic platform in developing
      countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nested PCR is considered a sensitive and specific method for
      detecting malaria parasites and is especially useful in epidemiological surveys. 
      However, the preparation of DNA templates for PCR is often time-consuming and
      costly. METHODS: A simplified PCR method was developed to directly use a small
      blood filter paper square (2 x 2 mm) as the DNA template after treatment with
      saponin. This filter paper-based nested PCR method (FP-PCR) was compared to
      microscopy and standard nested PCR with DNA extracted by using a Qiagen DNA mini 
      kit from filter paper blood spots of 204 febrile cases. The FP-PCR technique was 
      further applied to evaluate malaria infections in 1,708 participants from
      cross-sectional epidemiological surveys conducted in Myanmar and Thailand.
      RESULTS: The FP-PCR method had a detection limit of ~0.2 parasites/muL blood,
      estimated using cultured Plasmodium falciparum parasites. With 204 field samples,
      the sensitivity of the FP-PCR method was comparable to that of the standard
      nested PCR method, which was significantly higher than that of microscopy.
      Application of the FP-PCR method in large cross-sectional studies conducted in
      Myanmar and Thailand detected 1.9% (12/638) and 6.2% (66/1,070) asymptomatic
      Plasmodium infections, respectively, as compared to the detection rates of 1.3%
      (8/638) and 0.04% (4/1,070) by microscopy. CONCLUSION: This FP-PCR method was
      much more sensitive than microscopy in detecting Plasmodium infections. It
      drastically increased the detection sensitivity of asymptomatic infections in
      cross-sectional surveys conducted in Thailand and Myanmar, suggesting that this
      FP-PCR method has a potential for future applications in malaria epidemiology
      studies.

TI  - Comparison of Giemsa microscopy with nested PCR for the diagnosis of malaria in
      North Gondar, north-west Ethiopia.
PG  - 174
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the leading communicable diseases in Ethiopia.
      Early diagnosis combined with prompt treatment is one of the main strategies for 
      malaria prevention and control. Despite its limitation, Giemsa microscopy is
      still considered to be the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. This study aimed 
      to compare the performance of Giemsa microscopy with nested polymerase chain
      reaction (nPCR) for the diagnosis of malaria in north-west Ethiopia. METHODS: A
      cross sectional study was conducted in public health facilities in North Gondar, 
      from March 2013 to April 2013. A total number of 297 subjects with suspected
      malaria were enrolled in the study. Finger-prick blood samples were collected and
      examined for Plasmodium parasites using Giemsa microscopy and standard nPCR.
      RESULTS: Among the study participants, 61.6% (183/297) patients tested positive
      for malaria by Giemsa microscopy of which, 72.1% (132/183) and 27.9% (51/183)
      were diagnosed as Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, respectively. By
      nPCR, 73.1% (217/297) were malaria-positive. Among microscopy-negative samples,
      13.1% (39/297) samples turned malaria-positive in nPCR. In nPCR, the rate of
      mixed Plasmodium infections was 4.7% (14/297) and 3.03% (9/297) were positive for
      Plasmodium ovale. Using nPCR as reference the sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive and negative predictive values of Giemsa microscopy were 82.0%, 93.8%,
      97.3% and 65.8%, respectively, with a good agreement (kappa = 0.668) to nested
      PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of Giemsa microscopy in identifyingP.
      falciparium infections were 74.0% and 87.4% and 63.2% and 96.5% for P. vivax
      infections, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although Giemsa microscopy remains the gold
      standard for malaria diagnosis in resource-limited environments, its sensitivity 
      and specificity as compared to nPCR is limited suggesting exploration of novel
      rapid and simplified molecular techniques for malaria-endemic countries. A high
      rate of misclassification and misidentification highlights the importance of
      adequate training for staff involved in malaria diagnosis.

TI  - The epidemiology of imported malaria in Taiwan between 2002-2013: the importance 
      of sensitive surveillance and implications for pre-travel medical advice.
PG  - 5651-64
LID - 10.3390/ijerph110605651 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology of imported malaria in
      Taiwan between 2002 and 2013. We analyzed the national data recorded by the
      Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC). Malaria cases were diagnosed by 
      blood films, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests. The risk of
      re-establishment of malarial transmission in Taiwan was assessed. A total of 229 
      malaria cases were included in our analysis. All of the cases were imported. One 
      hundred and ninety-two cases (84%) were diagnosed within 13 days of the start of 
      symptoms/signs; 43% of these cases were acquired in Africa and 44% were acquired 
      in Asia. Plasmodium falciparum was responsible for the majority (56%) of these
      cases. Travel to an endemic area was associated with the acquisition of malaria. 
      The malaria importation rate was 2.36 per 1,000,000 travelers (range 1.20-5.74). 
      The reproductive number under control (Rc) was 0. No endemic transmission of
      malaria in Taiwan was identified. This study suggests that a vigilant
      surveillance system, vector-control efforts, case management, and an educational 
      approach focused on travelers and immigrants who visit malaria endemic countries 
      are needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of malaria in Taiwan.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and clinical response for artemether-lumefantrine in 
      pregnant and nonpregnant women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      in Tanzania.
PG  - 4583-92
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02595-14 [doi]
AB  - Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated
      malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Its efficacy during
      pregnancy has recently been challenged due to altered pharmacokinetic (PK)
      properties in this vulnerable group. The aim of this study was to determine the
      PK profile of AL in pregnant and nonpregnant women and assess their therapeutic
      outcome. Thirty-three pregnant women and 22 nonpregnant women with malaria were
      treated with AL (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. All patients provided five
      venous plasma samples for drug quantification at random times over 7 days. Inter-
      and intraindividual variability was assessed, and the effects of covariates were 
      quantified using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach (NONMEM). A
      one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination with linear
      metabolism from drug to metabolite fitted the data best for both arthemether (AM)
      and lumefantrine (LF) and their metabolites. Pregnancy status and diarrhea showed
      a significant influence on LF PK. The relative bioavailability of lumefantrine
      and its metabolism rate into desmethyl-lumefantrine were, respectively, 34% lower
      and 78% higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant patients. The overall
      PCR-uncorrected treatment failure rates were 18% in pregnant women and 5% in
      nonpregnant women (odds ratio [OR] = 4.04; P value of 0.22). A high median day 7 
      lumefantrine concentration was significantly associated with adequate clinical
      and parasitological response (P = 0.03). The observed reduction in the relative
      bioavailability of lumefantrine in pregnant women may explain the higher
      treatment failure in this group, mostly due to lower posttreatment prophylaxis.
      Hence, a modified treatment regimen of malaria in pregnancy should be considered.

AB  - Single-dose mass drug administration of azithromycin (AZT) is underway to
      eliminate trachoma worldwide. Studies in Ethiopia showed a reduction in all-cause
      childhood deaths after administration. To examine the effect of single-dose AZ
      MDA on prevalent malaria infections in a large prospective cohort of children and
      parents in Dodoma Province, Tanzania, we quantified the temporal prevalence of
      malaria parasitemia by real-time PCR for 6 months after single-dose AZT. In the
      first month after treatment but not in subsequent months, Plasmodium falciparum
      infections were reduced by 73% (95% CI 43%-89%) in treatment versus control
      villages and differences remained significant (p = 0.00497) in multivariate
      models with village-level random effects. Genetic sequencing of P. falciparum
      ribosomal L4 protein showed no mutations associated with AZT resistance. AZT mass
      drug administration caused a transient, 1-month antimalarial effect without
      selecting for P. falciparum ribosomal L4 resistance mutations in a region with a 
      10-year history of treating trachoma with this drug.

TI  - Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant women in the Chittagong
      Hill Districts of Bangladesh.
PG  - e98442
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0098442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a known risk factor for malaria which is associated with
      increased maternal and infant mortality and morbidity in areas of moderate-high
      malaria transmission intensity where Plasmodium falciparum predominates. The
      nature and impact of malaria, however, is not well understood in pregnant women
      residing in areas of low, unstable malaria transmission where P. falciparum and
      P. vivax co-exist. METHODS: A large longitudinal active surveillance study of
      malaria was conducted in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh. Over 32
      months in 2010-2013, the period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum
      infections was assessed by rapid diagnostic test and blood smear and compared
      among men, non-pregnant women and pregnant women. A subset of samples was tested 
      for infection by PCR. Hemoglobin was assessed. Independent risk factors for
      malaria infection were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model.
      RESULTS: Total of 34 asymptomatic P. falciparum infections were detected by
      RDT/smear from 3,110 tests. The period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum
      infection in pregnant women was 2.3%, compared to 0.5% in non-pregnant women and 
      0.9% in men. All RDT/smear positive samples that were tested by PCR were
      PCR-positive, and PCR detected additional 35 infections that were RDT/smear
      negative. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, pregnant women had
      5.4-fold higher odds of infection as compared to non-pregnant women.
      Malaria-positive pregnant women, though asymptomatic, had statistically lower
      hemoglobin than those without malaria or pregnancy. Asymptomatic malaria was
      found to be evenly distributed across space and time, in contrast to symptomatic 
      infections which tend to cluster. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is a risk factor for
      asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in the Chittagong Hill Districts of
      Bangladesh, and pregnancy and malaria interact to heighten the effect of each on 
      hemoglobin. The even distribution of asymptomatic malaria, without temporal and
      spatial clustering, may have critical implications for malaria elimination
      strategies.

AB  - Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for malaria parasites is an increasingly recommended
      diagnostic endpoint in clinical trials of vaccine and drug candidates and is also
      important in surveillance of malaria control and elimination efforts. A variety
      of reported NAT assays have been described, yet no formal external quality
      assurance (EQA) program provides validation for the assays in use. Here, we
      report results of an EQA exercise for malaria NAT assays. Among five centers
      conducting controlled human malaria infection trials, all centers achieved 100%
      specificity and demonstrated limits of detection consistent with each
      laboratory's pre-stated expectations. Quantitative bias of reported results
      compared to expected results was generally <0.5 log10 parasites/mL except for one
      laboratory where the EQA effort identified likely reasons for a general
      quantitative shift. The within-laboratory variation for all assays was low at
      <10% coefficient of variation across a range of parasite densities. Based on this
      study, we propose to create a Molecular Malaria Quality Assessment program that
      fulfills the need for EQA of malaria NAT assays worldwide.

AB  - During a longitudinal study investigating the dynamics of malaria in Ugandan
      lakeshore communities, a consistently high malaria prevalence was observed in
      young children despite regular treatment. To explore the short-term performance
      of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), a pilot investigation into parasite carriage
      after treatment(s) was conducted in Bukoba village. A total of 163 children (aged
      2-7 years) with a positive blood film and rapid antigen test were treated with
      AL; only 8.7% of these had elevated axillary temperatures. On day 7 and then on
      day 17, 40 children (26.3%) and 33 (22.3%) were positive by microscopy,
      respectively. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that multi-species Plasmodium
      infections were common at baseline, with 41.1% of children positive for
      Plasmodium falciparum/Plasmodium malariae, 9.2% for P. falciparum/ Plasmodium
      ovale spp. and 8.0% for all three species. Moreover, on day 17, 39.9% of children
      infected with falciparum malaria at baseline were again positive for the same
      species, and 9.2% of those infected with P. malariae at baseline were positive
      for P. malariae. Here, chronic multi-species malaria infections persisted in
      children after AL treatment(s). Better point-of-care diagnostics for
      non-falciparum infections are needed, as well as further investigation of AL
      performance in asymptomatic individuals.

TI  - Prevalence of bloodstream pathogens is higher in neonatal encephalopathy cases
      vs. controls using a novel panel of real-time PCR assays.
PG  - e97259
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0097259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In neonatal encephalopathy (NE), infectious co-morbidity is difficult
      to diagnose accurately, but may increase the vulnerability of the developing
      brain to hypoxia-ischemia. We developed a novel panel of species-specific
      real-time PCR assays to identify bloodstream pathogens amongst newborns with and 
      without NE in Uganda. METHODOLOGY: Multiplex real-time PCR assays for important
      neonatal bloodstream pathogens (gram positive and gram negative bacteria,
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus(HSV) and P. falciparum) were
      performed on whole blood taken from 202 encephalopathic and 101 control infants. 
      Automated blood culture (BACTEC) was performed for all cases and unwell controls.
      PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Prevalence of pathogenic bacterial species amongst infants
      with NE was 3.6%, 6.9% and 8.9%, with culture, PCR and both tests in combination,
      respectively. More encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial
      species detected (8.9%vs2.0%, p = 0.028) using culture and PCR in combination.
      PCR detected bacteremia in 11 culture negative encephalopathic infants (3 Group B
      Streptococcus, 1 Group A Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus aureus and 6
      Enterobacteriacae). Coagulase negative staphylococcus, frequently detected by PCR
      amongst case and control infants, was considered a contaminant. Prevalence of
      CMV, HSV and malaria amongst cases was low (1.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively).
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This real-time PCR panel detected more bacteremia than
      culture alone and provides a novel tool for detection of neonatal bloodstream
      pathogens that may be applied across a range of clinical situations and settings.
      Significantly more encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial
      species detected suggesting that infection may be an important risk factor for NE
      in this setting.

TI  - Gold mining areas in Suriname: reservoirs of malaria resistance?
PG  - 111-6
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S60906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, malaria cases in Suriname occur predominantly in migrants
      and people living and/or working in areas with gold mining operations. A
      molecular survey was performed in Plasmodium falciparum isolates originating from
      persons from gold mining areas to assess the extent and role of mining areas as
      reservoirs of malaria resistance in Suriname. METHODS: The status of 14 putative 
      resistance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pfdhfr, pfcrt,
      pfmdr1, and pfATP6 genes was assessed for 28 samples from gold miners diagnosed
      with P. falciparum malaria using polymerase chain reaction amplification and
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and the results were compared 
      with earlier data from nonmining villagers. RESULTS: Isolates from miners showed 
      a high degree of homogeneity, with a fixed pfdhfr Ile51/Asn108, pfmdr1
      Phe184/Asp1042/Tyr1246, and pfcrt Thr76 mutant genotype, while an exclusively
      wild-type genotype was observed for pfmdr1 Asn86 and pfdhfr Ala16, Cys59, and
      Ile164, and for the pfATP6 positions Leu263/Ala623/Ser769. Small variations were 
      observed for pfmdr1 S1034C. No statistically significant difference could be
      detected in allele frequencies between mining and nonmining villagers.
      CONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of malaria infection in individuals
      working/living in gold mining areas, we did not detect an increase in mutation
      frequency at the 14 analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms. Therefore, mining
      areas in Suriname cannot yet be considered as reservoirs for malaria resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the sources of infection and the mode of transmission of a
      malaria case with unknown origin. METHODS: Clinical data of the case were
      collected and the epidemiological investigation was conducted. The blood samples 
      of the patient and the suspected infection source (blood donor) were detected by 
      microscopy, rapid diagnostic test strip (RDT) and nested PCR. RESULTS: The
      patient did not visited malaria endemic areas. After a blood transfusion, the
      patient had chills and fever, and was confirmed as falciparum malaria by
      microscopy with bone marrow and peripheral blood smears and RDT. The blood donor 
      was a worker returned from Africa. Before blood donation she was sick like
      malaria carrier, and took anti-malarial drug. She was then confirmed as
      falciparum malaria by RDT and microscopy. The blood samples from the patient and 
      the blood donor were diagnosed as falciparum malaria by nested PCR, and the
      similarity of the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) sequence was 100%, showing they
      were mix-infected with K1 and MAD20 genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum.
      CONCLUSION: This patient is confirmed P. falciparum infection via blood
      transfusion from a donor who returned from Africa.

TI  - [Comparison of two rapid diagnostic tests in detection of malaria parasites].
PG  - 50-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for
      malaria parasite detection. METHODS: Blood samples of 200 malaria patients and 60
      non-malaria persons were collected from Yunnan and Shanghai, respectively. The
      sera were detected by gold-colloidal immunochromatography (GICA) and OptiMAL, and
      microscopy was used as gold standard in species identification. The sensitivity, 
      specificity, minimum detection limit of the two RDTs was compared. RESULTS: Of
      the 260 samples, malaria parasites were found in 200 by microscopy, of which 100 
      each were Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Compared with
      microscopy, the sensitivity and specificity of GICA and OptiMAL for the samples
      were 87.5% (175/200) and 93.3% (56/60), 95.5% (191/200) and 100.0% (60/60),
      respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of GICA and OptiMAL for detection
      of P. falciparum were 83.0% (83/100) and 96.9% (155/160), 90.0% (90/100) and
      99.4% (159/160), respectively; and for detection of P. vivax, they were 89.0%
      (89/100) and 98.8% (158/160), 96.0% (96/100) and 97.5% (156/160), respectively.
      There was a significant difference in malaria detection between GICA and OptiMAL 
      (chi2 = 8.23, P < 0.05). No statistical difference was found between the two RDTs
      in P. falciparum and P. vivax detection (P > 0.05). OptiMAL showed better result 
      in detection of P. falciparum when the parasite density was higher. The minimum
      detection limit of the two RDTs was about 100-200 parasites/microl blood.
      CONCLUSION: Compared to GICA, OptiMAL has higher sensitivity and specificity.
      However, GICA shows lower minimum detection limit and better reproducibility in
      blood samples with different densities than that of OptiMAL.

PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential interaction between the ApiAP2 protein
      family member, PF3D7_1107800, and var intron of Plasmodium falciparum in vivo.
      METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain), 5'
      end gene fragment of PF3D7_1107800 was amplified by PCR, and cloned into
      pGEX-4T-1 vector. The constructed pGEX-4T-1-PF3D7_1107800N was transformed into
      E. Coli BL21 (DE3) and followed by expression of the protein induced by IPTG. The
      recombinant protein was purified through glutathione sepharose. Twenty female
      BALB/c mice were divided into 2 group. Ten mice in experiment group were
      immunized with a mixture of the purified protein and Freund's adjuvant by
      subcutaneous injection. Other 10 mice received PBS injection as control. Sera
      from mice of 2 group were purified with protein G. The effect of the antibody was
      testified with Western blotting. DNA products of ChIP assay was analyzed for
      enrichment of anti-PF3D7_1107800 group in ups C var intron by qPCR. RESULTS: PCR 
      result of the PF3D7_1107800 gene 5' end segment showed that there was a specific 
      band (about 345 bp), which was consistent with the theoretical value. The
      constructed vector pGEX-4T-1-PF3D7_1107800N was confirmed by gene sequencing.
      SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the recombinant protein 
      was about Mr 37,000. The anti-PF3D7_1107800 serum was obtained after the
      immunization of mice with the purified protein, and reacted with the recombinant 
      protein, the specific band was about Mr 200,000. qPCR result showed that the fold
      enrichment of anti-PF3D7_1107800 group in var intron was two times higher than
      that of the reference gene region. CONCLUSION: The Plasmodium falciparum ApiAP2
      family member PF3D7_1107800 binds to ups C var intron region in vivo.

AB  - Anopheles annularis is one of the major vectors of malaria in Odisha, India. The 
      present study was undertaken to determine the vectorial capacity and assess the
      genetic diversity of An. annularis collected from different endemic regions of
      Odisha. Mosquitoes were collected from thirteen endemic districts using standard 
      entomological collection methods from 2009 to 2011. Sibling species of An.
      annularis were identified by PCR-RFLP and sequencing of D3 region of 28S
      ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite rate and human
      blood fed percentage (HBF) were estimated by multiplex PCR using Pf and human
      specific primers. Genetic diversity of An. annularis was estimated by ISSR
      markers. Out of 1647 An. annularis collected, 1353 (82.15%) were collected by
      mechanical aspirators and 294 (17.85%) by light trap. 49 (2.97%) were positive
      for human blood and 18 (1.09%) were positive for Pf sporozoite. PCR-RFLP and
      sequencing analyses detected only An annularis A in the study areas. Overall
      genetic differentiation among An. annularis populations was moderate (FST=0.048) 
      and showed significant correlation between genetic distance and geographic
      distance (r=0.882; P<0.05). Angul population proved to be genetically unique and 
      was highly divergent FST>0.110) from other populations, suggesting low gene flow 
      between them. The study indicated that only An. annularis A was found in Odisha
      with potential vectorial capacity that can play a major role in malaria
      transmission. ISSR markers proved to be useful molecular tools to evaluate
      genetic variability in An. annularis populations.

PG  - 651-6
LID - 10.1645/13-449.1 [doi]
AB  - A complete mitochondrial genome for the blood parasite Hepatozoon catesbianae
      (Alveolata; Apicomplexa; Coccidia; Adeleorina; Hepatozoidae) was obtained through
      PCR amplification and direct sequencing of resulting PCR products. The
      mitochondrial genome of H. catesbianae is 6,397 bp in length and contains 3
      protein-coding genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI]; cytochrome c oxidase 
      subunit III [COIII]; and cytochrome B [CytB]). Sequence similarities to
      previously published mitochondrial genomes of other apicomplexan parasites
      permitted annotation of 23 putative rDNA fragments in the mitochondrial genome of
      H. catesbianae, 14 large subunit rDNA fragments, and 9 small subunit rDNA
      fragments. Sequences corresponding to rDNA fragments RNA5, RNA8, RNA11, and RNA19
      of Plasmodium falciparum were not identified in the mitrochondrial genome
      sequence of H. catesbianae. Although the presence of 3 protein-coding regions and
      numerous putative rDNA fragments is a feature typical for apicomplexan
      mitochondrial genomes, the mitochondrial genome of H. catesbianae possesses a
      structure and gene organization that is distinct among the Apicomplexa. This is
      the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence obtained from any apicomplexan
      parasite in the suborder Adeleorina.

TI  - Single-cell genomics for dissection of complex malaria infections.
PG  - 1028-38
LID - 10.1101/gr.168286.113 [doi]
AB  - Most malaria infections contain complex mixtures of distinct parasite lineages.
      These multiple-genotype infections (MGIs) impact virulence evolution, drug
      resistance, intra-host dynamics, and recombination, but are poorly understood. To
      address this we have developed a single-cell genomics approach to dissect MGIs.
      By combining cell sorting and whole-genome amplification (WGA), we are able to
      generate high-quality material from parasite-infected red blood cells (RBCs) for 
      genotyping and next-generation sequencing. We optimized our approach through
      analysis of >260 single-cell assays. To quantify accuracy, we decomposed mixtures
      of known parasite genotypes and obtained highly accurate (>99%) single-cell
      genotypes. We applied this validated approach directly to infections of two major
      malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum, for which long term culture is possible, 
      and Plasmodium vivax, for which no long-term culture is feasible. We demonstrate 
      that our single-cell genomics approach can be used to generate parasite genome
      sequences directly from patient blood in order to unravel the complexity of P.
      vivax and P. falciparum infections. These methods open the door for large-scale
      analysis of within-host variation of malaria infections, and reveal information
      on relatedness and drug resistance haplotypes that is inaccessible through
      conventional sequencing of infections.

TI  - CDPKs of Cryptosporidium parvum--stage-specific expression in vitro.
PG  - 2525-33
LID - 10.1007/s00436-014-3902-0 [doi]
AB  - Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic agent that bears a high risk for the health 
      of particularly immunocompromised humans and animals. As currently available
      drugs and therapies against cryptosporidiosis do not turn out satisfactory, more 
      intensive research on the control of this parasite is necessary. The genus
      Cryptosporidium is unique within the phylum Apicomplexa as its localisation is
      intracellular but extracytoplasmatic. Infection of host cells is initially a
      parasite-driven process, but the signalling events and their downstream actions
      within Cryptosporidium are poorly understood. Calcium-dependent protein kinases
      (CDPKs) are probably involved in the regulation of invasion and egress.
      Previously described in plants, algae and other Apicomplexa, CDPKs are not found 
      in vertebrates. They are thus promising targets for pharmaceutical intervention. 
      While CDPK1 is well characterised in Toxoplasma gondii (TgCDPK1) and Plasmodium
      falciparum (PfCDPK1), only little information exists about the expression and
      function of CDPK in C. parvum. Here, we describe results of the in silico
      analysis of seven CpCDPKs. Five CpCDPKs contain potential sites for
      N-myristoylation and N-palmitoylation. In a nested 3' rapid amplification of cDNA
      ends (RACE)-PCR, expression of six CpCDPKs resulted in distinct bands in infected
      cell cultures and extracts of freshly excysted sporozoites. The length of the 3' 
      untranslated region (3' UTR) is described as well. Our results indicate CDPK
      expression to be stage specific on the mRNA level.

TI  - Plasmodium genome in blood donors at risk for malaria after several years of
      residence in Italy.
PG  - 2419-24
LID - 10.1111/trf.12650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, the main risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) in
      nonendemic countries is chronic, asymptomatic immigrants from malaria-endemic
      areas. Semi-immune donors may carry undetected parasitemia. This study examines
      Plasmodium infection in at-risk blood donors in Northern Italy. STUDY DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Plasma samples from 97 candidate donors and 80 controls were tested for 
      malarial antibodies using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. The conserved 18S rRNA
      and the mitochondrial genes of Plasmodium were amplified to detect and quantify
      parasite genomes (copies/mL). Plasmodium species were identified with a
      species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. Parasitemic samples were
      further tested by amplification of polymorphic repetitive regions in MSP-1 Block 
      2, MSP-2 Block 3, and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) confirmed by sequencing.
      RESULTS: Three of 83 seropositive (3.6%) and one of 14 seronegative at-risk
      candidate donors carried Plasmodium genome (4 x 10(3) -8.5 x 10(4) copies/mL):
      two P. falciparum, one P. malariae (seronegative sample), and one coinfection
      with P. malariae and P. ovale. Alleles of MSP-1 (MAD20 and K1), MSP-2 (3D7 and
      FC27), and GLURP were amplified from Sample 261. In Sample 282 only one allele in
      MSP-2 (FC27) and GLURP was amplified. No alleles were detected in Samples 283 and
      331. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants from endemic countries might carry infectious
      Plasmodium after 2 to 5 years of continuous residence in Italy. Serologic
      screening may miss donors carrying P. malariae. Permanent exclusion or screening 
      for both antibodies and genome are needed to prevent TTM.

LID - 10.1155/2014/935469 [doi]
AB  - Despite malaria control programs in recent years, malaria transmission has not
      been eliminated in Iran. Molecular techniques including PCR, which has proved
      more sensitive and specific than microscopic examination methods, help to detect 
      infection in low levels of parasitemia and mixed infections. Main our objectives 
      were setting up nested PCR for detection of malaria and evaluating PCR based on
      plasmodia DNA from blood smears in Fars province, the comparison of this method
      with traditional microscopy and also evaluate the data in comparison with its
      neighboring province, Hormozgan. A total of 149 malaria positive samples
      including 116, 19, and 14 samples from Shiraz, Jask, and Lengeh ports were
      utilized in this study, respectively. Blood slides were prepared for microscopic 
      observation. DNA from thin smears was extracted and nested PCR was analyzed using
      rPLU5 and rPLU6 for genus specification, rFAL1, rFAL2, and rVIV1, rVIV2 for P.
      falciparum and P. vivax detection, respectively. The results showed that 126
      (84.6%), 16 (10.7%), and 7 (4.7%) out of 149 cases were positive for P. vivax, P.
      falciparum, and mixed infections, respectively, by microscopy. The PCR indicated 
      that 95 (63.7%), 15 (10.1%), and 22 (14.8%) cases were infected with P. vivax, P.
      falciparum, and mixed mentioned species, respectively, and 17 (11.4%) cases were 
      uninfected. Our results confirmed the considerable sensitivity of nested PCR for 
      detection of the mixed infections. Simultaneous application of PCR even based on 
      microscopy slides can facilitate access to the highest level of confidence in
      malaria researches.

TI  - Field evaluation of a real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal
      amplification assay, RealAmp, for the diagnosis of malaria in Thailand and India.
PG  - 1180-7
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To eliminate malaria, surveillance for submicroscopic infections is
      needed. Molecular methods can detect submicroscopic infections but have not
      hitherto been amenable to implementation in surveillance programs. A portable
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay called RealAmp was assessed in 2
      areas of low malaria transmission. METHODS: RealAmp was evaluated in 141 patients
      from health clinics in India (passive surveillance) and in 127 asymptomatic
      persons in Thailand (active surveillance). The diagnostic validity, precision,
      and predictive value of RealAmp were determined using polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) as the reference method. A pilot study of RealAmp was also performed on
      samples from patients presenting at a Thai health center. RESULTS: A total of 96 
      and 7 positive cases were detected in India and Thailand, respectively, via PCR. 
      In comparison with nested PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in
      India were 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.3%-98.3%) and 100% (95% CI,
      92.1%-100%), respectively, with correct identification of all 5 Plasmodium vivax 
      cases. In Thailand, compared with pooled real-time PCR, RealAmp demonstrated 100%
      sensitivity (95% CI, 59.0%-100%) and 96.7% specificity (95% CI, 91.7%-99.1%).
      Testing at the health center demonstrated RealAmp's potential to serve as a
      point-of-care test with results available in 30-75 minutes. CONCLUSION: RealAmp
      was comparable to PCR in detecting malaria parasites and shows promise as a tool 
      to detect submicroscopic infections in malaria control and elimination programs
      worldwide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use ultrasound to explore the impact of malaria in pregnancy on
      fetal growth and newborn outcomes among a cohort of women enrolled in an
      intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) program in coastal Kenya. METHODS: Enrolled women 
      were tested for malaria at first prenatal care visit, and physical and ultrasound
      examinations were performed. In total, 477 women who had term, live births had
      malaria tested at delivery and their birth outcomes assessed, and were included
      in the study. RESULTS: Peripheral malaria was detected via polymerase chain
      reaction among 10.9% (n=87) at first prenatal care visit and 8.8% (n=36) at
      delivery. Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) were used by 73.6% (n=583) and were
      associated with decreased malaria risk. There was a trend for impaired fetal
      growth and placental blood flow in malaria-infected women in the second
      trimester, but not later in pregnancy. Among women with low body mass index
      (BMI), malaria was associated with reduced birth weight (P=0.04); anthropometric 
      measures were similar otherwise. CONCLUSION: With IPTp-SP and ITNs, malaria in
      pregnancy was associated with transient differences in utero, and reduced birth
      weight was restricted to those with low BMI.

AB  - The conventional molecular diagnosis of malaria uses 18S rRNA-based PCR assay
      employing blood samples. This assay presents limitation in terms of long
      turnaround time and increased chances of false-positive results. Here, we
      evaluated one-step singleplex or multiplex PCR assay based on high copy
      species-specific consensus repeat sequences (CRS) along with standard 18S rRNA
      nested PCR (18S n-PCR) assay to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax infection using
      blood and saliva samples from Indian febrile patients. Out of 327 patients, 187
      were found to be positive for malaria parasites by microscopic examination of
      peripheral blood smears. Among these 130 were P. vivax and 57 were P. falciparum 
      cases. The 18S n-PCR assay and CRS PCR assay identified 186 out of 187 cases
      (99.4 %). Multiplex CRS PCR assay detected Plasmodium in 176 out of 187 cases
      (94.1 %). Both singleplex and multiplex CRS PCR assay identified 6 mixed
      infection cases, while 18S n-PCR assay detected 10 mixed infection cases of P.
      vivax and P. falciparum, which were not recognized by microscopy. Non-invasive
      Plasmodium detection rate with DNA derived from saliva samples was highest for
      18S n-PCR (87.36 %), followed by singleplex CRS (81 %) and multiplex CRS PCR
      assay (70.5 %). Specificity for P. vivax and P. falciparum detection for all
      assays was 98.48 % and 100 % respectively. Detection rate for P. vivax in saliva 
      correlated with parasite density for CRS target-based assays. The
      species-specific CRS PCR, either as a singleplex or multiplex assay, can have an 
      impact on diagnosis and epidemiological studies in malaria.

      patients.

LID - 10.1093/trstmh/tru061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria can be diagnosed in saliva and urine using mitochondrial PCR 
      detection of Plasmodium DNA. METHODS: Blood, saliva and urine were collected from
      99 febrile patients referred to health centers in Sistan and Baluchestan
      Province, southeastern Iran, from May to November 2011. The mitochondrial
      cytochrome b gene of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was targeted in
      saliva, urine and blood samples using nested PCR. RESULTS: Nested PCR proved to
      be more sensitive than microscopy for the diagnosis of sub-microscopic and
      mixed-species infections. The results of nested PCR amplifications of saliva and 
      urine samples showed the same specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 91% and 70%, 
      respectively. Nested PCR amplifications of saliva samples and microscopy showed
      the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
      were more accurate than nested PCR amplifications of urine samples. CONCLUSION:
      Nested PCR amplification of saliva samples showed good levels of detection of
      mitochondrial Plasmodium DNA as compared to nested PCR of blood (small ka,
      Cyrillic=0.84; AUC=0.94), which was used as a reference standard. Based on the
      results of nested PCR as well as the advantages of saliva sampling, we suggest
      that saliva could be an alternative to blood, in malaria diagnosis, in cases
      where repeat sampling is required. Further studies are needed to validate these
      findings.

TI  - Performance of a new gelled nested PCR test for the diagnosis of imported
      malaria: comparison with microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, and real-time PCR.
PG  - 2587-91
LID - 10.1007/s00436-014-3911-z [doi]
AB  - Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the techniques commonly used for
      malaria diagnosis but they are usually insensitive at very low levels of
      parasitemia. Nested PCR is commonly used as a reference technique in the
      diagnosis of malaria due to its high sensitivity and specificity. However, it is 
      a cumbersome assay only available in reference centers. We evaluated a new nested
      PCR-based assay, BIOMALAR kit (Biotools B&M Labs, Madrid, Spain) which employs
      ready-to-use gelled reagents and allows the identification of the main four
      species of Plasmodium. Blood samples were obtained from patients with clinical
      suspicion of malaria. A total of 94 subjects were studied. Fifty-two (55.3%) of
      them were malaria-infected subjects corresponding to 48 cases of Plasmodium
      falciparum, 1 Plasmodium malariae, 2 Plasmodium vivax, and 1 Plasmodium ovale.
      The performance of the BIOMALAR test was compared with microscopy, rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT) (BinaxNOW(R) Malaria) and real-time quantitative PCR
      (qPCR). The BIOMALAR test showed a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 89.7-100), superior to microscopy (82.7% [95% CI, 69.7-91.8]) and RDT
      (94.2% [95% CI, 84.1-98.8]) and similar to qPCR (100% [95% CI, 93.2-100]). In
      terms of specificity, the BIOMALAR assay showed the same value as microscopy and 
      qPCR (100% [95% CI, 93.2-100]). Nine subjects were submicroscopic carriers of
      malaria. The BIOMALAR test identified almost all of them (8/9) in comparison with
      RDT (6/9) and microscopy (0/9). In conclusion, the BIOMALAR is a PCR-based assay 
      easy to use with an excellent performance and especially useful for diagnosis
      submicroscopic malaria.

PG  - 158
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopy and antigen detecting rapid diagnostic tests are the
      diagnostic tests of choice in management of clinical malaria. However, due to
      their limitations, the need to utilize more sensitive methods such as real-time
      PCR (qPCR) is evident as more studies are now utilizing molecular methods in
      detection of malaria. Some of the challenges that continue to limit the
      widespread utilization of qPCR include lack of assay standardization, assay
      variability, risk of contamination, and the need for cold-chain. Lyophilization
      of molecular assays can overcome some of these limitations and potentially enable
      widespread qPCR utilization. METHODS: A recently published multiplex malaria qPCR
      assay was lyophilized by freezing drying into Sample-Ready format (MMSR). MMSR
      assay contained all the required reagents for qPCR including primers and probes, 
      requiring only the addition of water and sample to perform qPCR. The performance 
      of the MMSR assay was compared to the non-freeze dried, "wet" assay. Stability
      studies were done by maintaining the MMSR assays at four different ambient
      temperatures of 4 degrees C, room temperature (RT), 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C
      over a period of 42 days, tested at seven-day intervals. Plasmodium falciparum
      and Plasmodium vivax DNAs were used for analysis of the MMSR assay either as
      single or mixed parasites, at two different concentrations. The CT values and the
      standard deviations (SD) were used in the analysis of the assay performance.
      RESULTS: The limit of detection for the MMSR assay was 0.244 parasites/muL for
      Plasmodium spp. (PLU) and P. falciparum (FAL) assay targets compared to "wet"
      assay which was 0.39 and 3.13 parasites/muL for PLU and FAL assay targets,
      respectively. The MMSR assay performed with high efficiencies similar to those of
      the "wet" assay and was stable at 37 degrees C for 42 days, with estimated
      shelf-life of 5 months. When used to analyse field clinical samples, MMSR assay
      performed with 100% sensitivity and specificity compared to the "wet" assay.
      CONCLUSION: The MMSR assay has the same robust performance characteristics as the
      "wet" assay and is highly stable. Availability of MMSR assay allows flexibility
      and provides an option in choosing assay for malaria diagnostics depending on the
      application, needs and budget.

LID - 10.1051/parasite/2014019 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is an important
      virulence factor encoded by a family of 59 var genes, including 56 var genes plus
      3 small var3 genes. The var genes are among the most diverse sequences in the P. 
      falciparum genome, but the var3 genes are found conserved in most P. falciparum
      strains. Previous studies have been mainly focused on the typical var genes,
      while the biological characteristics of the var3 genes remain unknown. In this
      study, the three var3 genes, PF3D7_0100300, PF3D7_0600400, and PF3D7_0937600,
      were found to be transcribed in the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, with a 
      peak in the transcription level at 16 h post-invasion, but terminated immediately
      after 16 h post-invasion. The encoded protein of PF3D7_0600400 could be detected 
      in both the late trophozoite stage and schizont stage, while the encoded proteins
      of PF3D7_0100300 and PF3D7_0937600 could only be detected in the late trophozoite
      stage and schizont stage, respectively. Thus, the var3 genes of the P. falciparum
      3D7 strain were differentially expressed during the erythrocytic development of
      the parasite.

TI  - High levels of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance Pfdhfr-Pfdhps quintuple
      mutations: a cross sectional survey of six regions in Tanzania.
PG  - 152
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2006, the first-line anti-malarial drug treatment in Tanzania was 
      changed from sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to artemether-lumefantrine (ALu), an
      artemisinin-based combination (ACT), since when the use of SP has been restricted
      for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). A number of Plasmodium
      falciparum mutations are known to be associated with resistance to SP, but it is 
      not known if the prevalence of these mutations is increasing or decreasing under 
      the conditions of reduced levels of SP use. This study reports on the current SP 
      resistant quintuple Pfdhfr-Pfdhps mutations in six regions of Tanzania. METHODS: 
      Finger-prick blood on filter paper and rapid diagnostic test strips from P.
      falciparum-positive individuals of all age groups attending health facilities in 
      six regions of Tanzania between June 2010 and August 2011 were obtained. Using
      chelex-100 extracted DNA, genotyping was done for mutations on codons 51, 59 and 
      108 of Pfdhfr and 437 and 540 of Pfdhps genes using PCR-RFLP technique. RESULTS: 
      A total of 802 malaria-positive samples were screened and genotyped. The
      prevalence of Pfdhfr 51I, Pfdhps 437G and 540E varied between the regions (p <
      0.001) whereas Pfdhfr 59R (FE 10.79, p = 0.225) and 108 N (FE 10.61, p = 0.239)
      did not vary between the regions. The Pfdhfr triple mutant was above 84% and
      close to fixation levels in all regions, whereas the Pfdhps double mutation
      ranged from 43.8 to 97% between the regions. The quintuple mutant (IRNGE) was the
      most prevalent in all regions and it varied significantly from 37.5 to 90.2%
      (chi(2) = 1.11, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of persistent high
      levels of SP resistance markers in Tanzania with evidence of quintuple mutations 
      that are likely to become fixed in the population. This threatens the future of
      SP not only in IPTp programmes, but as a combination drug for ACT. Continuous
      monitoring of SP-IPTp efficacy should be encouraged subsequent to searching for
      alternative drugs for IPTp in East Africa.

TI  - Causes of non-malarial fever in Laos: a prospective study.
PG  - e46-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of reductions in the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in Laos, identification of the causes of fever in people without malaria,
      and discussion of the best empirical treatment options, are urgently needed. We
      aimed to identify the causes of non-malarial acute fever in patients in rural
      Laos. METHODS: For this prospective study, we recruited 1938 febrile patients,
      between May, 2008, and December, 2010, at Luang Namtha provincial hospital in
      northwest Laos (n=1390), and between September, 2008, and December, 2010, at
      Salavan provincial hospital in southern Laos (n=548). Eligible participants were 
      aged 5-49 years with fever (>/=38 degrees C) lasting 8 days or less and were
      eligible for malaria testing by national guidelines. FINDINGS: With conservative 
      definitions of cause, we assigned 799 (41%) patients a diagnosis. With exclusion 
      of influenza, the top five diagnoses when only one aetiological agent per patient
      was identified were dengue (156 [8%] of 1927 patients), scrub typhus (122 [7%] of
      1871), Japanese encephalitis virus (112 [6%] of 1924), leptospirosis (109 [6%] of
      1934), and bacteraemia (43 [2%] of 1938). 115 (32%) of 358 patients at Luang
      Namtha hospital tested influenza PCR-positive between June and December, 2010, of
      which influenza B was the most frequently detected strain (n=121 [87%]). Disease 
      frequency differed significantly between the two sites: Japanese encephalitis
      virus infection (p=0.04), typhoid (p=0.006), and leptospirosis (p=0.001) were
      more common at Luang Namtha, whereas dengue and malaria were more common at
      Salavan (all p<0.0001). With use of evidence from southeast Asia when possible,
      we estimated that azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and ofloxacin would
      have had significant efficacy for 258 (13%), 240 (12%), 154 (8%), and 41 (2%) of 
      patients, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that a wide range of
      treatable or preventable pathogens are implicated in non-malarial febrile illness
      in Laos. Empirical treatment with doxycycline for patients with undifferentiated 
      fever and negative rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and dengue could be an
      appropriate strategy for rural health workers in Laos. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust,

TI  - Viral CNS infections in children from a malaria-endemic area of Malawi: a
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - e153-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever with reduced consciousness is an important cause of hospital
      admission of children in sub-Saharan Africa, with high mortality. Cerebral
      malaria, diagnosed when acute Plasmodium falciparum infection and coma are
      recorded with no other apparent reason, is one important cause. We investigated
      whether viruses could also be an important cause of CNS infection in such
      patients, and examined the relative contribution of viral pathogens and malaria
      parasitaemia. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study in Blantyre, Malawi.
      From March 1, 2002, to Aug 31, 2004, we enrolled children aged between 2 months
      and 15 years who were admitted to hospital with suspected non-bacterial CNS
      infections. Children with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count of less
      than 1000 cells per muL and negative bacterial microscopy and culture were deemed
      to have suspected viral CNS infection. Blood was examined for asexual forms of P 
      falciparum. PCR was done on CSF or on post-mortem brain biopsy specimens to
      detect 15 viruses known to cause CNS infection. FINDINGS: Full outcome data were 
      available for 513 children with suspected viral CNS infection, of whom 94 (18%)
      died. 163 children (32%) had P falciparum parasitaemia, of whom 34 (21%) died. At
      least one virus was detected in the CNS in 133 children (26%), of whom 43 (33%)
      died. 12 different viruses were detected; adenovirus was the most common,
      affecting 42 children; mumps, human herpes virus 6, rabies, cytomegalovirus,
      herpes simplex virus 1, and enterovirus were also important. 45 (9%) of the 513
      children had both parasitaemia and viral infection, including 27 (35%) of 78
      diagnosed clinically with cerebral malaria. Children with dual infection were
      more likely to have seizures than were those with parasitaemia alone, viral
      infection only, or neither (p<0.0001). 17 (38%) of the 45 children with dual
      infection died, compared with 26 (30%) of 88 with viral infection only, 17 (14%) 
      of 118 with parasitaemia only, and 34 (13%) of 262 with neither (p<0.0001).
      Logistic regression showed children with a viral CNS infection had a
      significantly higher mortality than did those who did not have a viral CNS
      infection (p=0.001). INTERPRETATION: Viral CNS infections are an important cause 
      of hospital admission and death in children in Malawi, including in children
      whose coma might be attributed solely to cerebral malaria. Interaction between
      viral infection and parasitaemia could increase disease severity. FUNDING:

TI  - Molecular characterization of Plasmodium falciparum uracil-DNA glycosylase and
      its potential as a new anti-malarial drug target.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on resistance of currently used anti-malarials, a new
      anti-malarial drug target against Plasmodium falciparum is urgently needed.
      Damaged DNA cannot be transcribed without prior DNA repair; therefore, uracil-DNA
      glycosylase, playing an important role in base excision repair, may act as a
      candidate for a new anti-malarial drug target. METHODS: Initially, the native
      PfUDG from parasite crude extract was partially purified using two columns, and
      the glycosylase activity was monitored. The existence of malarial UDG activity
      prompted the recombinant expression of PfUDG for further characterization. The
      PfUDG from chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistant P. falciparum strain K1 was
      amplified, cloned into the expression vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli. 
      The recombinant PfUDG was analysed by SDS-PAGE and identified by LC-MS/MS. The
      three dimensional structure was modelled. Biochemical properties were
      characterized. Inhibitory effects of 12 uracil-derivatives on PfUDG activity were
      investigated. Inhibition of parasite growth was determined in vitro using SYBR
      Green I and compared with results from human cytotoxicity tests. RESULTS: The
      native PfUDG was partially purified with a specific activity of 1,811.7 units/mg 
      (113.2 fold purification). After cloning of 966-bp PCR product, the 40-kDa
      hexa-histidine tagged PfUDG was expressed and identified. The amino acid sequence
      of PfUDG showed only 24.8% similarity compared with the human enzyme. The
      biochemical characteristics of PfUDGs were quite similar. They were inhibited by 
      uracil glycosylase inhibitor protein as found in other organisms. Interestingly, 
      recombinant PfUDG was inhibited by two uracil-derived compounds;
      1-methoxyethyl-6-(p-n-octylanilino)uracil (IC50 of 16.75 muM) and
      6-(phenylhydrazino)uracil (IC50 of 77.5 muM). Both compounds also inhibited
      parasite growth with IC50s of 15.6 and 12.8 muM, respectively. Moreover,
      1-methoxyethyl-6-(p-n-octylanilino)uracil was not toxic to HepG2 cells, with IC50
      of > 160 muM while 6-(phenylhydrazino)uracil exhibited cytoxicity, with IC50 of
      27.5 muM. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant PfUDG was expressed, characterized and
      compared to partially purified native PfUDG. Their characteristics were not
      significantly different. PfUDG differs from human enzyme in its size and
      predicted amino acid sequence. Two uracil derivatives inhibited PfUDG and
      parasite growth; however, only one non-cytotoxic compound was found. Therefore,
      this selective compound can act as a lead compound for anti-malarial development 
      in the future.

PG  - 148
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-148 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primaquine, the only available drug effective against Plasmodium
      falciparum sexual stages, induces also a dose-dependent haemolysis, especially in
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PDd) individuals. Therefore, it is
      important to determine the prevalence of this deficiency in areas that would
      potentially benefit from its use. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency by genotype
      and enzyme activity was determined in healthy school children in The Gambia.
      METHODS: Blood samples from primary school children collected during a dry season
      malaria survey were screened for G6PDd and malaria infection. Genotypes for
      allele mutations reported in the country; 376, 202A-, 968A- and 542 were analysed
      while enzyme activity (phenotype) was assayed using a semi-quantitative
      commercial test kit. Enzyme activity values were fitted in a finite mixture model
      to determine the distribution and calculate a cut-off for deficiency. The
      association between genotype and phenotype for boys and girls as well as the
      association between mutant genotype and deficient phenotype was analysed.
      RESULTS: Samples from 1,437 children; 51% boys were analysed. The prevalence of
      P. falciparum malaria infection was 14%. The prevalence of the 202A-, 968 and 542
      mutations was 1.8%, 2.1% and 1.0%, respectively, and higher in boys than in
      girls. The prevalence of G6PDd phenotype was 6.4% (92/1,437), 7.8% (57/728) in
      boys and 4.9% (35/709) in girls with significantly higher odds in the former (OR 
      1.64, 95% CI 1.05, 2.53, p = 0.026). The deficient phenotype was associated with 
      reduced odds of malaria infection (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36, 1.62, p = 0.49).
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a weak association between genotype and phenotype estimates
      of G6PDd prevalence. The phenotype expression of deficiency represents
      combinations of mutant alleles rather than specific mutations. Genotype studies
      in individuals with a deficient phenotype would help identify alleles responsible
      for haemolysis.

TI  - A quality control program within a clinical trial Consortium for PCR protocols to
      detect Plasmodium species.
PG  - 2144-9
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00565-14 [doi]
AB  - Malaria parasite infections that are only detectable by molecular methods are
      highly prevalent and represent a potential transmission reservoir. The methods
      used to detect these infections are not standardized, and their operating
      characteristics are often unknown. We designed a proficiency panel of Plasmodium 
      spp. in order to compare the accuracy of parasite detection of molecular
      protocols used by labs in a clinical trial consortium. Ten dried blood spots
      (DBSs) were assembled that contained P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P.
      ovale; DBSs contained either a single species or a species mixed with P.
      falciparum. DBS panels were tested in 9 participating laboratories in a masked
      fashion. Of 90 tests, 68 (75.6%) were correct; there were 20 false-negative
      results and 2 false positives. The detection rate was 77.8% (49/63) for P.
      falciparum, 91.7% (11/12) for P. vivax, 83.3% (10/12) for P. malariae, and 70%
      (7/10) for P. ovale. Most false-negative P. falciparum results were from samples 
      with an estimated </= 5 parasites per mul of blood. Between labs, accuracy ranged
      from 100% to 50%. In one lab, the inability to detect species in mixed-species
      infections prompted a redesign and improvement of the assay. Most PCR-based
      protocols were able to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax at higher densities, but
      these assays may not reliably detect parasites in samples with low P. falciparum 
      densities. Accordingly, formal quality assurance for PCR should be employed
      whenever this method is used for diagnosis or surveillance. Such efforts will be 
      important if PCR is to be widely employed to assist malaria elimination efforts.

TI  - Selection of drug resistance-mediating Plasmodium falciparum genetic
      polymorphisms by seasonal malaria chemoprevention in Burkina Faso.
PG  - 3660-5
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02406-14 [doi]
AB  - Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), with regular use of amodiaquine plus
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ/SP) during the transmission season, is now a
      standard malaria control measure in the Sahel subregion of Africa. Another
      strategy under study is SMC with dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DP).
      Plasmodium falciparum single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P. falciparum crt
      (pfcrt), pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps are associated with decreased response to
      aminoquinoline and antifolate antimalarials and are selected by use of these
      drugs. To characterize selection by SMC of key polymorphisms, we assessed 13 SNPs
      in P. falciparum isolated from children aged 3 to 59 months living in
      southwestern Burkina Faso and randomized to receive monthly DP or AQ/SP for 3
      months in 2009. We compared SNP prevalence before the onset of SMC and 1 month
      after the third treatment in P. falciparum PCR-positive samples from 120 randomly
      selected children from each treatment arm and an additional 120 randomly selected
      children from a control group that did not receive SMC. The prevalence of
      relevant mutations was increased after SMC with AQ/SP. Significant selection was 
      seen for pfcrt 76T (68.5% to 83.0%, P = 0.04), pfdhfr 59R (54.8% to 83.3%, P =
      0.0002), and pfdhfr 108N (55.0% to 87.2%, P = 0.0001), with trends toward
      selection of pfmdr1 86Y, pfdhfr 51I, and pfdhps 437G. After SMC with DP, only
      borderline selection of wild-type pfmdr1 D1246 (mutant; 7.7% to 0%, P = 0.05) was
      seen. In contrast to AQ/SP, SMC with DP did not clearly select for known
      resistance-mediating polymorphisms. SMC with AQ/SP, but not DP, may hasten the
      development of resistance to components of this regimen. (This study has been
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00941785.).

TI  - A case of quadruple malaria infection imported from Mozambique to Japan.
PG  - 1098-101
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0477 [doi]
AB  - A 35-year-old Japanese man had an intermittent fever and mild headache for eight 
      weeks after he returned to Japan from working in Mozambique. He had taken
      antimalarial prophylaxis (doxycycline) for 25 weeks, and stopped taking this drug
      two weeks after his return. Microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear
      showed a mixed infection with Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, and P. ovale. In
      addition, a nested polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing detected
      specific DNA sequences of four species of Plasmodium, including P. malariae. The 
      patient was successfully treated with artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine
      phosphate. The present case is a rare instance of a mixed infection with four
      species of Plasmodium. Nonimmune persons in malaria-endemic areas may have a risk
      of mixed infection. All four species must be identified by using sensitive and
      specific tests, such as a nested polymerase chain reaction, in addition to
      conventional morphologic identification.

AB  - In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), artesunate-amodiaquine is
      first-line therapy for falciparum malaria; little is known about the prevalence
      of molecular markers of parasite drug resistance. Across the DRC, we genotyped
      166 parasites in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt)
      using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Of these parasites, 73
      (44%) parasites were pure wild-type CVMNK, 55 (31%) parasites were
      chloroquine-resistant CVIET: , 35 (21.1%) parasites were mixed CVMNK and CVIET: ,
      and 3 parasites were other genotypes. Ninety-two infections (55.4%) harbored the 
      pfcrt K76T: substitution that is highly correlated with chloroquine failure. The 
      amodiaquine-resistant S: VMNT: haplotype was absent. Geographically, pfcrt
      haplotypes were not clearly clustered. Chloroquine accounted for 19.4% of
      antimalarial use, and amodiaquine accounted for 15.3% of antimalarial use; there 
      were no associations between drug use and mutant haplotype prevalence. In the
      DRC, our molecular survey indicates that resistance to chloroquine is substantial
      but that resistance to amodiaquine is absent. These contrasting findings
      highlight the need for molecular surveillance of drug resistance to inform
      malaria control policies.

AB  - Malaria and HIV are the two most important health challenges of our time.
      Haematologic abnormalities are features in Plasmodium falciparum infection, and
      anaemia is a well-known outcome. The prevalence and haematological impact of P.
      falciparum parasitaemia were determined among HIV-infected individuals in
      Nigeria. Parasite detection was carried out using microscopy and Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR). Haemoglobin concentration was determined using an automated
      machine while CD4+ T-cells count was analyzed using flow cytometer. Thirty-seven 
      (18.5%) out of the 200 HIV individuals enrolled had malaria parasites detected in
      their blood. All the positive cases were detected by PCR while only 20 (10%) were
      detected by thick blood microscopy. The mean haemoglobin concentration and packed
      cell volume (PCV) of HIV individuals with malaria parasitaemia were lower
      compared to those without malaria parasitaemia but the difference was not
      statistically significant. Also no significant difference was observed in malaria
      positivity in respect to sex and mean CD4+ cell count. The study highlights the
      effects of P. falciparum parasitaemia on the haematologic and immune components
      of HIV individuals.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum has successfully developed resistance to almost all
      currently used antimalarials. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the P.
      falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene at position 76
      resulting in a change in coding from lysine to threonine (K76T) has been
      implicated to be the corner stone of chloroquine resistance. Widespread
      resistance to chloroquine in endemic regions led to its replacement with other
      antimalarials. In some areas this replacement resulted in a reversion of the
      mutant T76 allele to the wild-type K76 allele. This study was conducted to
      determine the prevalence of the K76T mutation of the Pfcrt gene eight years after
      the ban on chloroquine sales and use. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 6 
      regional hospitals in Ghana. PCR-RFLP was used to analyse samples collected to
      determine the prevalence of Pfcrt K76T mutation. Of the 1318 participants
      recruited for this study, 246 were found to harbour the P. falciparum parasites, 
      of which 60.98% (150/246) showed symptoms for malaria. The prevalence of the
      Pfcrt T76 mutant allele was 58.54% (144/246) and that of the K76 wild-type allele
      was 41.46% (102/246). No difference of statistical significance was observed in
      the distribution of the alleles in the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants 
      (P=0.632). No significant association was, again, observed between the alleles
      and parasite density (P=0.314), as well as between the alleles and Hb levels of
      the participants (P=0.254). Notwithstanding the decline in the prevalence of the 
      Pfcrt T76 mutation since the antimalarial policy change in 2004, the 58.54%
      prevalence recorded in this study is considered high after eight years of the
      abolishment of chloroquine usage in Ghana. This is in contrast to findings from
      other endemic areas where the mutant allele significantly reduced in the
      population after a reduction chloroquine use.

AB  - This study investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection
      of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in urine and saliva of malaria
      patients. From May to November 2011, 108 febrile patients referred to health
      centers in Sistan and Baluchestan Province of south-eastern Iran participated in 
      the study. Saliva, urine, and blood samples were analyzed with nested PCR and
      LAMP targeting the species-specific nucleotide sequence of small subunit
      ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) of P. falciparum and P. vivax and evaluated for
      diagnostic accuracy by comparison to blood nested PCR assay. When nested PCR of
      blood is used as standard, microscopy and nested PCR of saliva and urine samples 
      showed sensitivity of 97.2%, 89.4% and 71% and specificity of 100%, 97.3% and
      100%, respectively. LAMP sensitivity of blood, saliva, and urine was 95.8%, 47%
      and 29%, respectively, whereas LAMP specificity of these samples was 100%.
      Microscopy and nested PCR of saliva and LAMP of blood were comparable to nested
      PCR of blood (small ka, Cyrillic=0.95, 0.83, and 0.94, respectively), but
      agreement for nested PCR of urine was moderate (small ka, Cyrillic=0.64) and poor
      to fair for saliva LAMP and urine LAMP (small ka, Cyrillic=0.38 and 0.23,
      respectively). LAMP assay showed low sensitivity for detection of Plasmodium DNA 
      in human saliva and urine compared to results with blood and to nested PCR of
      blood, saliva, and urine. However, considering the advantages of LAMP technology 
      and of saliva and urine sampling, further research into the method is worthwhile.
      LAMP protocol and precise preparation protocols need to be defined and optimized 
      for template DNA of saliva and urine.

AB  - The immunological consequences of pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) due to
      Plasmodium falciparum have been extensively investigated in cross-sectional
      studies conducted at delivery, but there have been very few longitudinal studies 
      of changes due to PAM during pregnancy. We conducted a prospective study in Benin
      to investigate the changes associated with PAM in groups of 131 and 111 women at 
      inclusion in the second trimester and at delivery, respectively. Infected women
      were identified by standard microscopic examinations of blood smears and by
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays and were matched to uninfected control women by
      age, gestational age, and gravidity. We quantified plasma levels of a panel of
      soluble immunological mediators and other mediators, as well as the frequencies
      of peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. Comparisons of these variables in
      infected and uninfected women used multivariate analyses, and we also assessed
      the predictive value of variables measured at inclusion for pregnancy outcomes at
      delivery. In multivariate analyses, peripheral plasma interleukin 10 (IL-10) and 
      gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels were associated with PAM at 
      inclusion and at delivery, while higher IL-10 levels distinguished
      qPCR-detectable submicroscopic infections at inclusion but not at delivery.
      Maternal anemia at delivery was associated with markers of proinflammatory
      (increased frequency of monocytes) and anti-inflammatory (increased IL-10 levels 
      and increased activation of regulatory T cells) activity measured at inclusion.
      Elevated concentrations of IL-10 are associated with the majority of P.
      falciparum infections during pregnancy, but this marker alone does not identify
      all submicroscopic infections. Reliably identifying such occult infections will
      require more sensitive and specific methods.

AB  - Intermediate-size noncoding RNAs (is-ncRNAs) have been shown to play important
      regulatory roles in the development of several eukaryotic organisms. However,
      they have not been thoroughly explored in Plasmodium falciparum, which is the
      most virulent malaria parasite infecting human being. By using Illumina/Solexa
      paired-end sequencing of an is-ncRNA-specific library, we performed a systematic 
      identification of novel is-ncRNAs in intraerythrocytic P. falciparum, strain 3D7.
      A total of 1,198 novel is-ncRNA candidates, including antisense, intergenic, and 
      intronic is-ncRNAs, were identified. Bioinformatics analyses showed that the
      intergenic is-ncRNAs were the least conserved among different Plasmodium species,
      and antisense is-ncRNAs were more conserved than their sense counterparts.
      Twenty-two novel snoRNAs were identified, and eight potential novel classes of P.
      falciparum is-ncRNAs were revealed by clustering analysis. The expression of
      randomly selected novel is-ncRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR and northern blotting
      assays. An obvious different expressional profile of the novel is-ncRNA between
      the early and late intraerythrocytic developmental stages of the parasite was
      observed. The expression levels of the antisense RNAs correlated with those of
      their cis-encoded sense RNA counterparts, suggesting that these is-ncRNAs are
      involved in the regulation of gene expression of the parasite. In conclusion, we 
      accomplished a deep profiling analysis of novel is-ncRNAs in P. falciparum,
      analysed the conservation and structural features of these novel is-ncRNAs, and
      revealed their differential expression patterns during the development of the
      parasite. These findings provide important information for further functional
      characterisation of novel is-ncRNAs during the development of P. falciparum.

TI  - PCR targeting Plasmodium mitochondrial genome of DNA extracted from dried blood
      on filter paper compared to whole blood.
PG  - 137

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring mortality and morbidity attributable to malaria is
      paramount to achieve elimination of malaria. Diagnosis of malaria is challenging 
      and PCR is a reliable method for identifying malaria with high sensitivity.
      However, blood specimen collection and transport can be challenging and obtaining
      dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper by finger-prick may have advantages over 
      collecting whole blood by venepuncture. METHODS: DBS and whole blood were
      collected from febrile children admitted at the general paediatric wards at a
      referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. DNA extracted from whole blood and 
      from DBS was tested with a genus-specific PCR targeting the mitochondrial
      Plasmodium genome. Positive samples by PCR of DNA from whole blood were tested
      with species-specific PCR targeting the 18S rRNA locus, or sequencing if
      species-specific PCR was negative. Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and thin blood
      smear microscopy was carried out on all patients where remnant whole blood and a 
      blood slide, respectively, were available. RESULTS: Positivity of PCR was 24.5
      (78/319) and 11.2% (52/442) by whole blood and DBS, respectively. All samples
      positive on DBS were also positive on Plasmodium falciparum species-specific PCR.
      All RDT positive cases were also positive by DBS PCR. All but three cases with
      positive blood slides were also positive by DBS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, PCR 
      for malaria mitochondrial DNA extracted from whole blood was more sensitive than 
      from DBS. However, DBS are a practical alternative to whole blood and detected
      approximately the same number of cases as RDTs and, therefore, remain relevant
      for research purposes.
