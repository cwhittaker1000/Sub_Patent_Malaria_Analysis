TI  - 3D QSAR, pharmacophore and molecular docking studies of known inhibitors and
      designing of novel inhibitors for M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase of Plasmodium
      falciparum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum M18 Aspartyl Aminopeptidase (PfM18AAP) is
      only aspartyl aminopeptidase which is found in the genome of P. falciparum and is
      essential for its survival. The PfM18AAP enzyme performs various functions in the
      parasite and the erythrocytic host such as hemoglobin digestion, erythrocyte
      invasion, parasite growth and parasite escape from the host cell. It is a valid
      target to develop antimalarial drugs. In the present work, we employed 3D QSAR
      modeling, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular docking to identify novel potent 
      inhibitors that bind with M18AAP of P. falciparum. RESULTS: The PLSR QSAR model
      showed highest value for correlation coefficient r(2) (88 %) and predictive
      correlation coefficient (pred_r2) =0.6101 for external test set among all QSAR
      models. The pharmacophore modeling identified DHRR (one hydrogen donor, one
      hydrophobic group, and two aromatic rings) as an essential feature of PfM18AAP
      inhibitors. The combined approach of 3D QSAR, pharmacophore, and structure-based 
      molecular docking yielded 10 novel PfM18AAP inhibitors from ChEMBL antimalarial
      library, 2 novel inhibitors from each derivative of quinine, chloroquine,
      8-aminoquinoline and 10 novel inhibitors from WHO antimalarial drugs.
      Additionally, high throughput virtual screening identified top 10 compounds as
      antimalarial leads showing G-scores -12.50 to -10.45 (in kcal/mol), compared with
      control compounds(G-scores -7.80 to -4.70) which are known antimalarial M18AAP
      inhibitors (AID743024). This result indicates these novel compounds have the best
      binding affinity for PfM18AAP. CONCLUSION: The 3D QSAR models of PfM18AAP
      inhibitors provided useful information about the structural characteristics of
      inhibitors which are contributors of the inhibitory potency. Interestingly, In
      this studies, we extrapolate that the derivatives of quinine, chloroquine, and
      8-aminoquinoline, for which there is no specific target has been identified till 
      date, might show the antimalarial effect by interacting with PfM18AAP.

TI  - Rapid Diagnostic Test Performance Assessed Using Latent Class Analysis for the
      Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum Placental Malaria.
PG  - 835-839
AB  - Placental malaria causes low birth weight and neonatal mortality in
      malaria-endemic areas. The diagnosis of placental malaria is important for
      program evaluation and clinical care, but is compromised by the suboptimal
      performance of current diagnostics. Using placental and peripheral blood
      specimens collected from delivering women in Malawi, we compared estimation of
      the operating characteristics of microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT),
      polymerase chain reaction, and histopathology using both a traditional
      contingency table and a latent class analysis (LCA) approach. The prevalence of
      placental malaria by histopathology was 13.8%; concordance between tests was
      generally poor. Relative to histopathology, RDT sensitivity was 79.5% in
      peripheral and 66.2% in placental blood; using LCA, RDT sensitivities increased
      to 93.7% and 80.2%, respectively. Our results, if replicated in other cohorts,
      indicate that RDT testing of peripheral or placental blood may be suitable
      approaches to detect placental malaria for surveillance programs, including areas
      where intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy is not used.

TI  - Prevalence of crt and mdr-1 mutations in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
      Grande Comore island after withdrawal of chloroquine.
PG  - 414
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1474-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Comoros, the widespread of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmodium
      falciparum populations was a major obstacle to malaria control, which led to the 
      official withdrawal of CQ in 2004. Continuous monitoring of CQ-resistant markers 
      of the P. falciparum CQ resistant transporter (pfcrt) and the P. falciparum
      multiple drug resistance 1 (pfmdr-1) is necessary inder to obtain first-hand
      information on CQ susceptibility of parasite populations in the field. The
      objective of this study is to assess the prevalence and evolution of
      CQ-resistance in the P. falciparum populations on the Comoros' Grande Comore
      island after withdrawal of CQ. METHODS: A total of 207 P. falciparum clinical
      isolates were collected from the island, including 118 samples from 2006 to 2007 
      and 89 samples from 2013 to 2014. Nucleotide substitutions in the pfcrt and
      pfmdr-1 genes linked to CQ response in parasite isolates were assessed using
      nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: From the pfcrt gene segment sequenced, we
      detected C72S, M74I, N75E, and K76T substitutions in the parasite isolates
      collected from both 2006-2007 to 2013-2014 periods. Significant decline of pfcrt 
      resistant alleles at C72S (42.6 to 6.9 %), M74I (39.1 to 14.9 %), N75E (63.5 to
      18.3 %), and K76T (72.2 to 19.5 %) from 2006-2007 to 2013-2014 were observed, and
      the frequency of pfcrt wild type allele was significantly increased from 19.1 %
      in 2006-2007 to 75.8 % in 2013-2014. Sequence analysis of pfmdr-1 also detected
      point mutations at codons N86Y, Y184F, and D1246Y, but not S1034C and N1042D, in 
      the isolates collected from both examined periods. An increasing trend in the
      prevalence of the pfmdr-1 wild type allele (NYD, 4.3 % in 2006-2007; and 28.7 %
      in 2013-2014), and a decreasing trend for pfmdr-1 N86Y mutation (87.0 % in
      2006-2007; and 40.2 % in 2013-2014) were observed in our samples. CONCLUSIONS:
      The present data indicate that the prevalence and patterns of mutant pfcrt and
      pfmdr-1 dramatically decreased in the Grande Comore isolates from 2006 to 2014,
      suggesting that the CQ-sensitive P. falciparum strains have returned after the
      withdrawal of CQ. The data also suggests that the parasites with wild type
      pfcrt/pfdmr-1 genes may have growth and/or transmission advantages over the
      mutant parasites. The information obtained from this study will be useful for
      developing and updating anti-malarial treatment policy in Grande Comore island.

TI  - [The first monkey malaria in Turkey: a case of Plasmodium knowlesi].
PG  - 484-90
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi is now added to the known four Plasmodium species (P.vivax,
      P.falciparum, P.malariae, P.ovale) as a cause of malaria in humans because of the
      recent increasing rate of cases reported from countries of southeastern Asia.
      P.knowlesi which infects macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis and M.nemestrina)
      is transmitted to humans especially by Anopheles leucosphyrus and An.hackeri
      mosquitos. First human cases of P.knowlesi malaria have been detected in Malaysia
      which have reached high numbers in recent years and also have been reported from 
      countries of Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Philippines, Myanmar, Singapore and
      Vietnam. However the number of cases reported from western countries are rare and
      limited only within voyagers. This report is the first presentation of an
      imported case of P.knowlesi malaria in Turkey and aims to draw attention to the
      point that it could also be detected in future. A 33-year-old male patient from
      Myanmar who has migrated to Turkey as a refugee, was admitted to a health center 
      with the complaints of fever with a periodicity of 24 hours, headache, fatigue,
      cough, sore throat, anorexia, myalgia and arthralgia. He was prediagnosed as
      upper respiratory tract infection, however because of his periodical fever and
      background in Myanmar, thick and thin blood films were prepared and sent to our
      laboratory for further examinations. Microscopic examination of the thin blood
      films revealed erythrocytic stages compatible with P.knowlesi (three large early 
      trophozoites in an erythrocyte, three late trophozoites with compact view, and
      three late band-form trophozoites). Upon this, both real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (Rt-PCR) targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) genes of
      Plasmodium genus and DNA sequence analysis targeting P.knowlesi rRNA gene were
      performed. As a result, the suspected identification of P.knowlesi by microscopy 
      was confirmed by Rt-PCR and DNA sequencing. The patient was treated with
      chloroquine and primaquine combination and in the follow-up on the seventh day
      after the treatment, his parasitemia and symptoms had ceased. Although there were
      some previous reports concerning about imported patients infected with different 
      Plasmodium species in our country, no cases of P.knowlesi have been reported.
      This first case presented here emphasizes the occurence of P.knowlesi malaria in 
      Turkey hereinafter due to the increasing number of refugees.

TI  - Prevalence of pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 Gene Deletion in Plasmodium falciparum
      Population in Eight Highly Endemic States in India.
PG  - e0157949
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0157949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum encoded histidine rich protein (HRP2) based
      malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in India. Deletion of pfhrp2 and
      pfhrp3 genes contributes to false negative test results, and large numbers of
      such deletions have been reported from South America, highlighting the importance
      of surveillance to detect such deletions. METHODS: This is the first prospective 
      field study carried out at 16 sites located in eight endemic states of India to
      assess the performance of PfHRP2 based RDT kits used in the national malaria
      control programme. In this study, microscopically confirmed P. falciparum but RDT
      negative samples were assessed for presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3, and their flanking
      genes using PCR. RESULTS: Among 1521 microscopically positive P. falciparum
      samples screened, 50 were negative by HRP2 based RDT test. Molecular testing was 
      carried out using these 50 RDT negative samples by assuming that 1471 RDT
      positive samples carried pfhrp2 gene. It was found that 2.4% (36/1521) and 1.8%
      (27/1521) of samples were negative for pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively.
      However, the frequency of pfhrp2 deletions varied between the sites ranging from 
      0-25% (2.4, 95% CI; 1.6-3.3). The frequency of both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene
      deletion varied from 0-8% (1.6, 95% CI; 1.0-2.4). CONCLUSION: This study provides
      evidence for low level presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deleted P. falciparum
      parasites in different endemic regions of India, and periodic surveillance is
      warranted for reliable use of PfHRP2 based RDTs.

TI  - Evaluation of new multiplex PCR primers for the identification ofPlasmodium
      species found in Sabah, Malaysia.

LID - 10.3906/sag-1411-114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Malaria is a major public health problem, especially in the
      Southeast Asia region, caused by 5 species of Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P.
      vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi). The aim of this study was to
      compare parasite species identification methods using the new multiplex
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against nested PCR and microscopy. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Blood samples on filter papers were subject to conventional PCR methods 
      using primers designed by us in multiplex PCR and previously designed primers of 
      nested PCR. Both sets of results were compared with microscopic identification.
      RESULTS: Of the 129 samples identified as malaria-positive by microscopy, 15
      samples were positive for P. falciparum, 14 for P. vivax, 6 for P. knowlesi, 72
      for P. malariae, and 2 for mixed infection of P. falciparum/P. malariae. Both
      multiplex and nested PCR identified 12 P. falciparum single infections. For P.
      vivax, 9 were identified by multiplex and 12 by nested PCR. For 72 P. malariae
      cases, multiplex PCR identified 58 as P. knowlesi and 10 as P. malariae compared 
      to nested PCR, which identified 59 as P. knowlesi and 7 as P. malariae.
      CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR could be used as alternative molecular diagnosis for
      the identification of all Plasmodium species as it requires a shorter time to
      screen a large number of samples.

TI  - Delayed Diagnosis of Falciparum Malaria with Acute Kidney Injury.
PG  - 1499-502
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2016.31.9.1499 [doi]
AB  - Prompt malaria diagnosis is crucial so antimalarial drugs and supportive care can
      then be rapidly initiated. A 15-year-old boy who had traveled to Africa (South
      Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria between January 3 and 25, 2011) presented with fever
      persisting over 5 days, headache, diarrhea, and dysuria, approximately 17 days
      after his return from the journey. Urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria. Blood 
      examination showed hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular
      coagulation, and hyperbilirubinemia. Plasmapheresis and hemodialysis were
      performed for 19 hospital days. Falciparum malaria was then confirmed by
      peripheral blood smear, and antimalarial medications were initiated. The
      patient's condition and laboratory results were quickly normalized. We report a
      case of severe acute renal failure associated with delayed diagnosis of
      falciparum malaria, and primary use of supportive treatment rather than
      antimalarial medicine. The present case suggests that early diagnosis and
      treatment is important because untreated tropical malaria can be associated with 
      severe acute renal failure and fatality. Physicians must be alert for correct
      diagnosis and proper management of imported tropical malaria when patients have
      travel history of endemic areas.

TI  - Malaria Incidence Rates from Time Series of 2-Wave Panel Surveys.
PG  - e1005065
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005065 [doi]
AB  - Methodology to estimate malaria incidence rates from a commonly occurring form of
      interval-censored longitudinal parasitological data-specifically, 2-wave panel
      data-was first proposed 40 years ago based on the theory of continuous-time
      homogeneous Markov Chains. Assumptions of the methodology were suitable for
      settings with high malaria transmission in the absence of control measures, but
      are violated in areas experiencing fast decline or that have achieved very low
      transmission. No further developments that can accommodate such violations have
      been put forth since then. We extend previous work and propose a new methodology 
      to estimate malaria incidence rates from 2-wave panel data, utilizing the class
      of 2-component mixtures of continuous-time Markov chains, representing two
      sub-populations with distinct behavior/attitude towards malaria prevention and
      treatment. Model identification, or even partial identification, requires
      context-specific a priori constraints on parameters. The method can be applied to
      scenarios of any transmission intensity. We provide an application utilizing data
      from Dar es Salaam, an area that experienced steady decline in malaria over
      almost five years after a larviciding intervention. We conducted sensitivity
      analysis to account for possible sampling variation in input data and model
      assumptions/parameters, and we considered differences in estimates due to
      submicroscopic infections. Results showed that, assuming defensible a priori
      constraints on model parameters, most of the uncertainty in the estimated
      incidence rates was due to sampling variation, not to partial identifiability of 
      the mixture model for the case at hand. Differences between microscopy- and
      PCR-based rates depend on the transmission intensity. Leveraging on a method to
      estimate incidence rates from 2-wave panel data under any transmission intensity,
      and from the increasing availability of such data, there is an opportunity to
      foster further methodological developments, particularly focused on partial
      identifiability and the diversity of a priori parameter constraints associated
      with different human-ecosystem interfaces. As a consequence there can be more
      nuanced planning and evaluation of malaria control programs than heretofore.

AB  - Identifying molecular predictors and mechanisms of malaria disease is important
      for understanding how Plasmodium falciparum malaria is controlled. Transcriptomic
      studies in humans have so far been limited to retrospective analysis of blood
      samples from clinical cases. In this prospective, proof-of-principle study, we
      compared whole-blood RNA-seq profiles at pre-and post-infection time points from 
      Malian adults who were either asymptomatic (n = 5) or febrile (n = 3) during
      their first seasonal PCR-positive P. falciparum infection with those from
      malaria-naive Dutch adults after a single controlled human malaria infection (n =
      5). Our data show a graded activation of pathways downstream of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines, with the highest activation in malaria-naive Dutch individuals and
      significantly reduced activation in malaria-experienced Malians. Newly febrile
      and asymptomatic infections in Malians were statistically indistinguishable
      except for genes activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The combined data
      provide a molecular basis for the development of a pyrogenic threshold as
      individuals acquire immunity to clinical malaria.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment based on quantitative PCR after controlled human malaria 
      infection.
PG  - 398
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1434-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) has become well-established
      in the evaluation of drugs and vaccines. Anti-malarial treatment is usually
      initiated when thick blood smears are positive by microscopy. This study explores
      the effects of using the more sensitive qPCR as the primary diagnostic test.
      METHODS: 1691 diagnostic blood samples were analysed by microscopy and qPCR from 
      115 volunteers (55 malaria naive and 60 having received chemoprophylaxis and
      sporozoite immunization) who were challenged by five mosquitoes infected with
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites of the NF54 strain. RESULTS: Retrospective
      analysis of different qPCR criteria for diagnosis and treatment, showed that once
      daily qPCR (threshold 100 parasites/ml) had 99 % sensitivity and 100 %
      specificity, and shortened the median prepatent period from 10.5 to 7.0 days
      after CHMI when compared to twice daily measurement of thick blood smears
      (threshold 4000 parasites/ml). This is expected to result in a 78 % decrease of
      adverse events before initiation of treatment in future studies. Trial outcome
      related to infection and protective efficacy remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The 
      use of qPCR as the primary diagnostic test in CHMI decreases symptoms as well as 
      parasitaemia while obviating the need for twice daily follow-up. The
      implementation improves safety while reducing the clinical burden and costs
      without compromising the evaluation of protective efficacy.

AB  - Malaria continues to cause alarming morbidity and mortality in more than 100
      countries worldwide. Antigens in the various life cycle stages of malaria
      parasites are presented to the immune system during natural infection and it is
      widely recognized that after repeated malaria exposure, adults develop partially 
      protective immunity. Specific antigens of natural immunity represent among the
      most important targets for the development of malaria vaccines. Immunity against 
      the transmission stages of the malaria parasite represents an important approach 
      to reduce malaria transmission and is believed to become an important tool for
      gradual elimination of malaria. Development of immunity against Plasmodium
      falciparum sexual stages was evaluated in primary school children aged 6-16 years
      in Makoni district of Zimbabwe, an area of low to modest malaria transmission.
      Malaria infection was screened by microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests and finally 
      using nested PCR. Plasma samples were tested for antibodies against recombinant
      Pfs48/45 and Pfs47 by ELISA. Corresponding serum samples were used to test for P.
      falciparum transmission reducing activity in Anopheles stephensi and An. gambiae 
      mosquitoes using the membrane feeding assay. The prevalence of malaria diagnosed 
      by rapid diagnostic test kit (Paracheck) was 1.7%. However, of the randomly
      tested blood samples, 66% were positive by nested PCR. ELISA revealed prevalence 
      (64% positivity at 1:500 dilution, in randomly selected 66 plasma samples) of
      antibodies against recombinant Pfs48/45 (mean A 405nm=0.53, CI=0.46-0.60) and
      Pfs47 (mean A405nm=0.91, CI=0.80-1.02); antigens specific to the sexual stages.
      The mosquito membrane feeding assay demonstrated measurable transmission reducing
      ability of the samples that were positive for Pfs48/45 antibodies by ELISA.
      Interestingly, 3 plasma samples revealed enhancement of infectivity of P.
      falciparum in An. stephensi mosquitoes. These studies revealed the presence of
      antibodies with transmission reducing immunity in school age children from a
      moderate transmission area of malaria, and provide further support to exploit
      target antigens such as Pfs48/45 for further development of a malaria
      transmission blocking vaccine.

      isolates from Tehama region, Yemen.

AB  - Introduction. Despite the efforts of the malaria control programme, malaria
      morbidity is still a common health problem in Yemen, with 60% of the population
      at risk. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 99% of malaria cases. The
      emergence in Yemen of parasite resistance to chloroquine (CQ) prompted the
      adoption of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in 2009, which involves the use
      of artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP). However, CQ was retained
      as the drug of choice for vivax malaria. To assess the impact of the change in
      the malaria treatment policy five years after its introduction, the present study
      investigated the mutations in the CQ resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug
      resistance 1 (pfmdr1) genes. Method. A molecular investigation of 10 codons of
      pfcrt (72-76, 220, 271, 326, 356, and 371) and five codons of pfmdr1 (86, 184,
      1034, 1042, and 1246) was conducted on P. falciparum isolates from districts with
      the highest malaria endemicity in the Hodeidah and Al-Mahwit governorates in
      Tehama region, Yemen. A total of 86 positive cases of falciparum monoinfection
      were investigated for the presence of mutations related to CQ and other
      antimalarials using a PCR-RFLP assay. Results. There was a wide prevalence of
      pfcrt gene mutations with the pfcrt 76T CQ resistance marker being predominant
      (97.7%). The prevalence of other pfcrt mutations varied from high (75E: 88%) to
      moderate (74I: 79.1%, 220S: 69.8%, 271E and 371I: 53.5%) or low (326S: 36%, 72S: 
      10.5%). Mutated pfcrt 72-76 amino acids haplotypes were highly prevalent (98.8%).
      Among these, the CVIET classic, old-world African/Southeast Asian haplotype was
      the most predominant, and was mostly found in the isolates from the Khamis Bani
      Saad district of Al-Mahwit (93.1%) and the AdDahi district of Hodeidah (88.9%).
      However, it was only found in 26.3% of the isolates from the Bajil district of
      Hodeidah. Surprisingly, the SVMNT new-world South American haplotype was
      exclusively detected in 9.3% of the isolates from the Bajil district of Hodeidah.
      Mutations at Y184F of pfmdr1 were found in all isolates (100%) from all
      districts. The mutation for codons 1034C and 86Y were found only in the isolates 
      from the AdDahi and Khamis Bani Saad districts. Overall, the AdDahi and Khamis
      Bani Saad districts were similar in terms of carrying most of the mutations in
      the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes, while there was a lower prevalence of mutation in the
      isolates from the Bajil district. Conclusion. The high prevalence of mutations in
      pfcrt 5 years after the official cessation of CQ use against P. falciparum
      suggests that there is sustained CQ pressure on P. falciparum isolates in the
      study area. Moreover, the low prevalence of mutations in the pfmdr1 gene could be
      a good indicator of the high susceptibility of P. falciparum isolates to
      antimalarials other than CQ. A new strategy to ensure the complete nationwide
      withdrawal of CQ from the private drug market is recommended.

TI  - High Plasmodium malariae Prevalence in an Endemic Area of the Colombian Amazon
      Region.
PG  - e0159968
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159968 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a worldwide public health problem; parasites from the genus Plasmodium
      are the aetiological agent for this disease. The parasites are mostly diagnosed
      by conventional microscopy-based techniques; however, their limitations have led 
      to under-registering the reported prevalence of Plasmodium species. This study
      has thus been aimed at evaluating the infection and coinfection prevalence of 3
      species of Plasmodium spp., in an area of the Colombian Amazon region. Blood
      samples were taken from 671 symptomatic patients by skin puncture; a nested PCR
      amplifying the 18S ssRNA region was used on all samples to determine the presence
      of P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum. Statistical analysis determined
      infection and coinfection frequency; the association between infection and
      different factors was established. The results showed that P. vivax was the
      species having the greatest frequency in the study population (61.4%), followed
      by P. malariae (43.8%) and P. falciparum (11.8%). The study revealed that 35.8%
      of the population had coinfection, the P. vivax/P. malariae combination occurring
      most frequently (28.3%); factors such as age, geographical origin and clinical
      manifestations were found to be associated with triple-infection. The prevalence 
      reported in this study differed from previous studies in Colombia; the results
      suggest that diagnosis using conventional techniques could be giving rise to
      underestimating some Plasmodium spp. species having high circulation rates in
      Colombia (particularly in the Colombian Amazon region). The present study's
      results revealed a high prevalence of P. malariae and mixed infections in the
      population being studied. The results provide relevant information which should
      facilitate updating the epidemiological panorama and species' distribution so as 
      to include control, prevention and follow-up measures.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from uncomplicated malaria
      cases in Ghana over a decade.
PG  - 416
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1692-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genotyping malaria parasites to assess their diversity in different
      geographic settings have become necessary for the selection of antigenic epitopes
      for vaccine development and for antimalarial drug efficacy or resistance
      investigations. This study describes the genetic diversity of Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates from uncomplicated malaria cases over a ten year period
      (2003-2013) in Ghana using the polymorphic antigenic marker, merozoite surface
      protein 2 (msp2). METHODS: Archived filter paper blood blots from children aged
      nine years and below with uncomplicated malaria collected from nine sites in
      Ghana were typed for the presence of the markers. A total of 880 samples were
      genotyped for msp2 for the two major allelic families, FC27 and 3D7, using nested
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The allele frequencies and the multiplicity of
      infection were determined for the nine sites for five time points over a period
      of ten years, 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2010 and 2012-2013 malaria
      transmission seasons. RESULTS: The number of different alleles detected for the
      msp2 gene by resolving PCR products on agarose gels was 14. Both of the major
      allelic families, 3D7 and FC27 were common in all population samples. The highest
      multiplicity of infection (MOI) was observed in isolates from Begoro (forest
      zone, rural site): 3.31 for the time point 2007-2008. A significant variation was
      observed among the sites in the MOIs detected per infection (Fisher's exact test,
      P < 0.001) for the 2007 isolates and also at each of the three sites with data
      for three different years, Hohoe, P = 0.03; Navrongo, P < 0.001; Cape Coast, P < 
      0.001. Overall, there was no significant difference between the MOIs of the three
      ecological zones over the years (P = 0.37) and between the time points when data 
      from all sites were pooled (P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: The diversity and variation
      between isolates detected using the msp2 gene in Ghanaian isolates were observed 
      to be profound; however, there was homogeneity throughout the three ecological
      zones studied. This is indicative of gene flow between the parasite populations
      across the country probably due to human population movements (HPM).

TI  - Performance of rapid diagnostic test, blood-film microscopy and PCR for the
      diagnosis of malaria infection among febrile children from Korogwe District,
      Tanzania.
PG  - 391
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1450-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and light microscopy are still
      recommended for diagnosis to guide the clinical management of malaria despite
      difficult challenges in rural settings. The performance of these tests may be
      affected by several factors, including malaria prevalence and intensity of
      transmission. The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of malaria RDT,
      light microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in detecting malaria
      infections among febrile children at outpatient clinic in Korogwe District,
      northeastern Tanzania. METHODS: The study enrolled children aged 2-59 months with
      fever and/or history of fever in the previous 48 h attending outpatient clinics. 
      Blood samples were collected for identification of Plasmodium falciparum
      infection using histidine-rich-protein-2 (HRP-2)-based malaria RDT, light
      microscopy and conventional PCR. RESULTS: A total of 867 febrile patients were
      enrolled into the study. Malaria-positive samples were 85/867 (9.8 %, 95 % CI,
      7.9-12.0 %) by RDT, 72/867 (8.3 %, 95 % CI, 6.5-10.1 %) by microscopy and 79/677 
      (11.7 %, 95 % CI, 9.3-14.3 %) by PCR. The performance of malaria RDT compared
      with microscopy results had sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of
      88.9 % (95 % CI, 79.3-95.1 %) and 75.3 % (95 % CI, 64.8-84.0 %), respectively.
      Confirmation of P. falciparum infection with PCR analysis provided lower
      sensitivity and PPV of 88.6 % (95 % CI, 79.5-94.7 %) and 84.3 % (95 % CI,
      74.7-91.4 %) for RDT compared to microscopy. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of malaria
      infection is still a challenge due to variation in results among diagnostic
      methods. HRP-2 malaria RDT and microscopy were less sensitive than PCR.
      Diagnostic tools with high sensitivity are required in areas of low malaria
      transmission.

PG  - 1235-42
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw323 [doi]
AB  - In regions of coendemicity for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax where
      mefloquine is used to treat P. falciparum infection, drug pressure mediated by
      increased copy numbers of the multidrug resistance 1 gene (pvmdr1) may select for
      mefloquine-resistant P. vivax Surveillance is not undertaken routinely owing in
      part to methodological challenges in detection of gene amplification. Using
      genomic data on 88 P. vivax samples from western Thailand, we identified pvmdr1
      amplification in 17 isolates, all exhibiting tandem copies of a 37.6-kilobase
      pair region with identical breakpoints. A novel breakpoint-specific polymerase
      chain reaction assay was designed to detect the amplification. The assay
      demonstrated high sensitivity, identifying amplifications in 13 additional,
      polyclonal infections. Application to 132 further samples identified the common
      breakpoint in all years tested (2003-2015), with a decline in prevalence after
      2012 corresponding to local discontinuation of mefloquine regimens. Assessment of
      the structure of pvmdr1 amplification in other geographic regions will yield
      information about the population-specificity of the breakpoints and underlying
      amplification mechanisms.

TI  - Prevalence of G6PD deficiency and Plasmodium falciparum parasites in asymptomatic
      school children living in southern Ghana.
PG  - 388
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1440-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked
      genetic disorder that results in impaired enzyme activity. Although G6PD
      deficiency is globally distributed it is more prevalent in malaria-endemic
      countries. Several mutations have been identified in the G6PD gene, which alter
      enzyme activity. The G6PD genotype predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa is
      the G6PDB (G6PD376A) with (G6PD376G) and G6PDA- (G6PD376G/202A, G6PD376G/542T,
      G6PD376G/680T and G6PD376G/968C) occurring at lower frequencies. AIM: The aim of 
      this study was to identify the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and asymptomatic
      Plasmodium falciparum carriage in children living in southern Ghana and determine
      whether G6PD deficiency influences asymptomatic carriage of P. falciparum
      parasites. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained once a month from 170 healthy
      Ghanaian school children aged between 5 and 12 years from Basic schools in two
      communities Obom and Abura with similar rainfall patterns and malaria peak
      seasons. G6PD enzyme activity was assessed using the qualitative G6PD RDT kit
      (AccessBIO). G6PD genotyping and asymptomatic parasite carriage was determined by
      PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of DNA extracted 
      from dried blood spots. RESULTS: The only sub-Saharan G6PD A- allele detected was
      the A376G/G202A found in 12.4 % (21/170), of the children and distributed as 4.1 
      % (7/170) A-, 1.8 % (3/170) A-/A- homozygous deficient males and females and 6.5 
      % (11/170) A/A- and B/A- heterozygous deficient females. Phenotypically, 10.6 %
      (15/142) of the children were G6PD deficient. The asymptomatic carriage of P.
      falciparum by PCR was 50, 29.4, 38.2 and 38.8 % over the months of February
      through May 2015, respectively, and 28.8, 22.4, 25.9 and 5.9 % by microscopy
      during the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: G6PD deficiency was significantly
      associated with a lowered risk of PCR-estimated asymptomatic P. falciparum
      carriage in children during the off peak malaria season in Southern Ghana.

TI  - In vitro selection of Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 variants by
      artemisinin.
PG  - 381
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1443-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drugs are the major focus in the prevention and
      treatment of malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the WHO
      recommended first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria across the
      endemic world. Also ACT is increasingly relied upon in treating Plasmodium vivax 
      malaria where chloroquine is failing. The emergence of artemisinin drug-resistant
      parasites is a serious threat faced by global malaria control programmes.
      Therefore, the success of treatment and intervention strategies is highly pegged 
      on understanding the genetic basis of resistance. METHODS: Here, resistance in P.
      falciparum was generated in vitro for artemisinin to produce levels above
      clinically relevant concentrations in vivo, and the molecular haplotypes
      investigated. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp mini DNA kit. DNA
      sequences of Pfk13, Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes were amplified by PCR and the
      amplicons were successfully sequenced. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were
      traced by standard bidirectional sequencing and reading the transcripts against
      wild-type sequences in Codon code Aligner Version 5.1 and NCBI blast. RESULTS:
      Exposure of parasite strains D6 and W2 to artemisinin resulted in a decrease in
      parasite susceptibility to artemisinin (W2 and D6) and lumefantrine (D6 only).
      The parasites exhibited elevated IC50s to multiple artemisinins, with >twofold
      resistance to artemisinin; however, the resistance index obtained with standard
      methods was noticeably less than expected for parasite lines recovered from 50
      microg/ml 48 h drug pressure. The change in parasite susceptibility was
      associated with Pfmdr-185K mutation, a mutation never reported before. The
      Pfcrt-CVMNK genotype (Pfcrt codons 72-76) was retained and notably, the study did
      not detect any polymorphisms reported to reduce P. falciparum susceptibility in
      vivo in the coding sequences of the Pfk13 gene. DISCUSSION: This data demonstrate
      that P. falciparum has the capacity to develop resistance to artemisinin
      derivatives in vitro and that this phenotype is achieved by mutations in Pfmdr1, 
      the genetic changes that are also underpinning lumefantrine resistance. This
      finding is of practical importance, because artemisinin drugs in Kenya are used
      in combination with lumefantrine for the treatment of malaria. CONCLUSION:
      Artemisinin resistance phenotype as has been shown in this work, is a decrease in
      parasites susceptibility to artemisinin derivatives together with the parasite's 
      ability to recover from drug-induced dormancy after exposure to drug dosage above
      the in vivo clinical concentrations. The study surmises that Pfmdr1 may play a
      role in the anti-malarial activity of artemisinin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistant power against different antimalarial
      agents particularly by Plasmodium falciparum is a challenge to combat malaria.
      Regular monitoring is essential not only to determine the efficacy and
      development of resistance by the parasite but also to detect early sign of
      regaining sensitivity to any anti-malarial agent that has been withdrawn for a
      long period. Studies on molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug
      resistance of prevailing Plasmodium population play an important role in this
      aspect. The present protocol was designed to study the polymorphisms in pfcrt and
      pfmdr-1 gene to determine any sign of regaining sensitivity to chloroquine among 
      P. falciparum after five years of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)
      implementation. METHODS: Clinical isolates were collected from P. falciparum
      positive patients attending the malaria clinic of Calcutta School of Tropical
      Medicine during December 2014 to December 2015. Genomic parasitic DNA was
      extracted and subjected to sequencing of pfcrt and pfmdr-1 gene directly from
      purified PCR products. RESULTS: A total of 89 isolates were sequenced for pfcrt
      and 73 isolates for pfmdr-1 genes. In pfcrt gene mutant K76T was detected in all 
      isolates and all were SVMNT haplotype. Out of three important polymorphisms in
      pfmdr-1 gene mutant Y184F was detected among all isolates. One synonymous G182G
      and one non-synonymous S232F/Y, mutation were detected in 99% isolates.
      CONCLUSION: All isolates carrying mutant K76T in pfcrt gene, considered as hall
      mark for CQ resistance, indicate that there is no sign of regaining CQ
      sensitivity among the prevailing P. falciparum population of the study area after
      five years of ACT implementation.

TI  - Anti-malarial seroprevalence assessment during an elimination programme in
      Chabahar District, south-eastern Iran.
PG  - 382
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1432-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iran has achieved a substantial decline in malaria incidence over the
      past decades. A common feature of malaria-endemic settings is the requirement for
      more sensitive techniques to describe levels of low transmission. In this study, 
      serological and parasitological methods were used to measure transmission levels 
      of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax during an elimination programme
      (2012) in Chabahar District, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, south-eastern Iran.
      METHODS: Participants were randomly selected from 64 different geographical
      clusters in Chabahar city and surrounding villages. Antibody responses to P.
      falciparum and P. vivax blood-stage antigens were assessed by ELISA, while
      microscopy and molecular testing were used to determine parasite carriage by
      species. Age-adjusted antibody responses were analysed using a reversible
      catalytic model to calculate seroconversion rates (SCR). RESULTS: There was no
      evidence of recent transmission in the study areas, indicated by an absence of
      parasite infections in all ages and low or absent serological responses to either
      species in young children. The best model for age P. falciparum seroconversion
      was one with a change in exposure 21 years before sampling was done in Chabahar
      city (P = 0.018) and 4 years in the villages (P = 0.039). There was a higher
      level of recent P. vivax transmission compared to P. falciparum, based on the
      SCRs, in both the city and village settings. CONCLUSION: Serological analysis
      identified a decline in P. falciparum transmission in the urban areas of
      Chabahar, consistent with a previously described decrease in malaria in the early
      1990s, demonstrating the utility of this approach to reconstruct exposure
      history. At present, it remains unclear whether the P. vivax antibody responses
      reflect active transmission due to new infections or relapse infections. The
      absence of parasitological and serological evidence of recent malaria
      transmission in Chabahar District is viable evidence for certification of
      elimination.

      gametocytocidal agents.
PG  - 385
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1429-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs that kill or inhibit Plasmodium gametocytes in the human host
      could potentially synergize the impact of other chemotherapeutic interventions by
      blocking transmission. To develop such agents, reliable methods are needed to
      study the in vitro activity of compounds against gametocytes. This study
      describes a novel assay for characterizing the activity of anti-malarial drugs
      against the later stages of Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte development using
      real-time PCR (qPCR). METHODS: Genes previously reported to be transcribed at the
      different sexual stages of the gametocytogenesis were selected for study and
      their mRNA expression was measured in a gametocytogenesis course by qPCR. Genes
      mainly expressed in the later stages of gametocyte development were used as a
      surrogate measurement of drug activity. To distinguish between cidal and static
      drug effects, two different experiments were performed in parallel, one with
      constant drug pressure throughout the experiment (144 h), and another in which
      the gametocyte cultures were exposed to the compound for only 48 h. RESULTS: Four
      P. falciparum genes coding for proteins Pf77, ROM3, Pfs25, and Pfg377 with
      transcription specific for late-stage gametocyte development were identified. The
      in vitro anti-malarial activity of compounds against such gametocytes was
      assessed by measuring mRNA levels of these genes using qPCR. The assay was
      validated against standard anti-malarial drugs (epoxomicin, dihydroartemisinin,
      chloroquine, thiostrepton, and methylene blue) and compounds from the GSK
      compound library with known anti-gametocyte activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      describes a novel assay for characterizing the activity of anti-malarial drugs
      against the later stages of P. falciparum gametocyte development using qPCR in
      genetically unmodified parasites. The method described is a reliable and
      user-friendly technique with a medium throughput that could be easily implemented
      in any laboratory.

AB  - About 3.6 million Pashtun and over 1.5 million immigrants from Afghanistan live
      in the federally administered tribal areas (FATA) on the border between
      Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and southern Afghanistan. Although malaria
      cases are common in FATA, no detailed studies have yet been performed to reveal
      the actual status of malaria in the local population and epidemiological data are
      insufficient to elucidate the actual incidence. A malariometric survey of 691
      patients of all ages and genders in seven agencies (districts) in FATA was
      carried out in 2013 using whole blood samples. Microscopically confirmed positive
      species were subjected to nested-PCR for the reconfirmation and detection of four
      species of Plasmodium causing human malaria. Of the 626 PCR positive cases, 81.1%
      were P. vivax, 13.8% P. falciparum and 4.9% mixed species containing both P.
      vivax and P. falciparum. P. malariae and P. ovale and were not found in any
      analysis. Sixty-five microscopic positive samples were identified as negative by 
      PCR. The incidence of P. vivax ranged from 10.4% in Orakzai Agency to 22.8% in
      North Waziristan Agency. The prevalence of P. falciparum ranged from 1.3% in
      Orakzai Agency to 4.7% in North Waziristan, and Khyber Agency had the highest
      prevalence of 1.7% of mixed species. In FATA, P. vivax and P. falciparum are the 
      main causative agents of malaria, while mixed species infections are also
      prevalent with varying transmission intensities. In addition, Estimates of
      malaria incidence shows that variation in the incidence, frequency and species
      composition of malarial parasites is high.

      10 years of use of artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1051/parasite/2016028 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In Benin, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been recommended
      as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria since
      2004. The emergence in Southeast Asia of parasites that are resistant to
      artemisinins poses a serious threat to global control of this disease. The
      presence of artemisinin resistance genotypes in parasite populations in Benin is 
      currently unknown. The present study investigated the prevalence of relevant
      K13-propeller gene polymorphisms in parasite isolates from the north-western
      region of Benin. METHOD: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected from
      children with a confirmed diagnosis of malaria aged 6 months to 5 years in two
      towns, Cobly and Djougou, in the north-western part of Benin. The study was
      conducted during the rainy season from July to November 2014 in local health
      facilities. The K13-propeller gene was amplified in parasite isolates using
      nested PCR and subsequently sequenced. RESULTS: A total of 108 children were
      recruited into the study. The efficiency of amplification reactions was 72%
      (78/108). The propeller domain of the K13 gene was successfully sequenced in 78
      P. falciparum isolates; all of them were wild type with no polymorphisms
      detectable. CONCLUSION: The absence of mutations in the K13 gene indicates that
      P. falciparum parasite populations in the study area are still fully susceptible 
      to artemisinins.

TI  - Comparison of the Performances of Five Primer Sets for the Detection and

PG  - e0159160
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159160 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrtPCR) has made a significant 
      improvement for the detection of Plasmodium in anopheline vectors. A wide variety
      of primers has been used in different assays, mostly adapted from molecular
      diagnosis of malaria in human. However, such an adaptation can impact the
      sensitivity of the PCR. Therefore we compared the sensitivity of five primer sets
      with different molecular targets on blood stages, sporozoites and oocysts
      standards of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv). Dilution series of
      standard DNA were used to discriminate between methods at low concentrations of
      parasite and to generate standard curves suitable for the absolute quantification
      of Plasmodium sporozoites. Our results showed that the best primers to detect
      blood stages were not necessarily the best ones to detect sporozoites. Absolute
      detection threshold of our qrtPCR assay varied between 3.6 and 360 Pv sporozoites
      and between 6 and 600 Pf sporozoites per mosquito according to the primer set
      used in the reaction mix. In this paper, we discuss the general performance of
      each primer set and highlight the need to use efficient detection methods for
      transmission studies.

PG  - 811-816
AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) remains the first-line treatment of malaria in Haiti. Given the 
      challenges of conducting in vivo drug efficacy trials in low-endemic settings
      like Haiti, molecular surveillance for drug resistance markers is a reasonable
      approach for detecting resistant parasites. In this study, 349 blood spots were
      collected from suspected malaria cases in areas in and around Port-au-Prince from
      March to July 2010. Among them, 121 samples that were Plasmodium falciparum
      positive by polymerase chain reaction were genotyped for drug-resistant pfcrt,
      pfdhfr, pfdhps, and pfmdr1 alleles. Among the 108 samples that were successfully 
      sequenced for CQ resistant markers in pfcrt, 107 were wild type (CVMNK), whereas 
      one sample carried a CQ-resistant allele (CVIET). Neutral microsatellite
      genotyping revealed that the CQ-resistant isolate was distinct from all other
      samples in this study. Furthermore, the remaining parasite specimens appeared to 
      be genetically distinct from other reported Central and South American
      populations.

TI  - Comparison of artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine fixed-dose
      combinations for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa: a randomised, multicentre,
      phase 4 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WHO recommends combinations of an artemisinin derivative plus an
      antimalarial drug of longer half-life as treatment options for uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum infection. In Africa, artemether-lumefantrine is the most
      widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy, whereas artesunate-mefloquine 
      is used infrequently because of a perceived poor tolerance to mefloquine. WHO
      recommends reconsideration of the use of artesunate-mefloquine in Africa. We
      compared the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose artesunate-mefloquine with that of
      artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of children younger than 5 years with
      uncomplicated P falciparum malaria. METHODS: We did this multicentre, phase 4,
      open-label, non-inferiority trial in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tanzania. Children 
      aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated malaria were randomly assigned (1:1), via a
      computer-generated randomisation list, to receive 3 days' treatment with either
      one or two artesunate-mefloquine tablets (25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine) 
      once a day or one or two artemether-lumefantrine tablets (20 mg artemether and
      120 mg lumefantrine) twice a day. Parasitological assessments were done
      independently by two microscopists who were blinded to treatment allocation. The 
      primary outcome was the PCR-corrected rate of adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR) at day 63 in the per-protocol population.
      Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference
      between groups was greater than -5%. Early vomiting was monitored and
      neuropsychiatric status assessed regularly during follow-up. This study is
      registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN17472707, and the Pan African Clinical
      Trials Registry, number PACTR201202000278282. FINDINGS: 945 children were
      enrolled and randomised, 473 to artesunate-mefloquine and 472 to
      artemether-lumefantrine. The per-protocol population consisted of 407 children in
      each group. The PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63 was 90.9% (370 patients) in the
      artesunate-mefloquine group and 89.7% (365 patients) in the
      artemether-lumefantrine group (treatment difference 1.23%, 95% CI -2.84% to
      5.29%). At 72 h after the start of treatment, no child had detectable
      parasitaemia and less than 6% had fever, with a similar number in each group (21 
      in the artesunate-mefloquine group vs 24 in the artemether-lumefantrine group).
      The safety profiles of artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine were
      similar, with low rates of early vomiting (71 [15.3%] of 463 patients in the
      artesunate-mefloquine group vs 79 [16.8%] of 471 patients in the
      artemether-lumefantrine group in any of the three dosing days), few neurological 
      adverse events (ten [2.1%] of 468 vs five [1.1%] of 465), and no detectable
      psychiatric adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Artesunate-mefloquine is effective
      and safe, and an important treatment option, for children younger than 5 years
      with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in Africa. FUNDING: Agence Francaise de

PG  - 253-9
LID - 10.3347/kjp.2016.54.3.253 [doi]
AB  - In the era of (pre) elimination setting, the prevalence of malaria has been
      decreasing in most of the previously endemic areas. Therefore, effective cost-
      and time-saving validated pooling strategy is needed for detection of malaria in 
      low transmission settings. In this study, optimal pooling numbers and lowest
      detection limit were assessed using known density samples prepared
      systematically, followed by genomic DNA extraction and nested PCR. Pooling
      strategy that composed of 10 samples in 1 pool, 20 microl in 1 sample, was
      optimal, and the parasite density as low as 2 p/microl for both falciparum and
      vivax infection was enough for detection of malaria. This pooling method showed
      effectiveness for handling of a huge number of samples in low transmission
      settings (<9% positive rate). The results indicated that pooling of the blood
      samples before DNA extraction followed by usual nested PCR is useful and
      effective for detection of malaria in screening of hidden cases in
      low-transmission settings.

TI  - Molecular Heterogeneity of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency in
      Burkina Faso: G-6-PD Betica Selma and Santamaria in People with Symptomatic
      Malaria in Ouagadougou.
PG  - e2016029
LID - 10.4084/MJHID.2016.029 [doi]
AB  - The G-6-PD deficiency has an important polymorphism with genotypic variants such 
      as 202A/376G, 376G/542T and 376G/968T known in West African populations. It would
      confer protection against severe forms of malaria although there are differences 
      between the various associations in different studies. In this study we genotyped
      six (06) variants of the G-6-PD gene in people with symptomatic malaria in urban 
      areas in Burkina Faso. One hundred and eighty-two (182) patients who tested
      positive using rapid detection test and microscopy were included in this study. A
      regular PCR with the GENESPARK G6PD African kit was run followed by
      electrophoresis, allowing initially to genotype six SNPs (G202A, A376G, A542T,
      G680T, C563T and T968C). Women carrying the mutations 202A and/or 376G were
      further typed by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes rs1050828 and rs1050829. In
      the study population the G-6-PD deficiency prevalence was 9.9%. In addition of
      G-6-PD A- (202A/376G) variant, 376G/542T and 376G/968T variants were also
      detected. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed that 22.5% (41/182) of the
      individuals had HbAC compared with2.2% with HbAS and one individual had double
      heterozygous HbSC. There was no correlation between the G-6-PD deficiency or
      haemoglobinopathies and symptomatic malaria infections in this study. Our study
      confirms that the G-6-PD deficiency does not confer protection against Plasmodium
      falciparum infections. As opposed to previous genotyping studies carried out in
      Burkina Faso, this study shows for the first time the presence of the variant A- 
      (376G/968C) and warrants further investigation at the national level and in
      specific ethnic groups.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted severe Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in a splenectomized
      patient with beta-thalassaemia major in Sabah, Malaysia: a case report.
PG  - 357
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1398-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is a well-recognized risk of
      receiving blood transfusions, and has occurred with Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. The simian parasite 
      Plasmodium knowlesi is also known to be transmissible through inoculation of
      infected blood, and this species is now the most common cause of malaria in
      Malaysia with a high rate of severity and fatal cases reported. No confirmed case
      of accidental transfusion-transmitted P. knowlesi has yet been reported. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 23-year old splenectomized patient with beta thalassaemia major
      presented with fever 11 days after receiving a blood transfusion from a
      pre-symptomatic donor who presented with knowlesi malaria 12 days following blood
      donation. The infection resulted in severe disease in the recipient, with a
      parasite count of 84,000/microL and associated metabolic acidosis and multi-organ
      failure. She was treated with intravenous artesunate and made a good recovery.
      Sequencing of a highly diverse 649-base pair fragment of the P. knowlesi
      bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene (pkdhfr) revealed 
      that the recipient and donor shared the same haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: This case
      demonstrates that acquisition of P. knowlesi from blood transfusion can occur,
      and that clinical consequences can be severe. Furthermore, this case raises the
      possibility that thalassaemic patients, particularly those who are
      splenectomized, may represent a high-risk group for TTM and severe malaria. With 
      rising P. knowlesi incidence, further studies in Sabah are required to determine 
      the risk of TTM in order to guide screening strategies for blood transfusion
      services.

TI  - PFMDR1 POLYMORPHISMS INFLUENCE ON IN VITRO SENSITIVITY OF THAI PLASMODIUM
      FALCIPARUM ISOLATES TO PRIMAQUINE, SITAMAQUINE AND TAFENOQUINE.
PG  - 366-76
AB  - Primaquine (PQ), an 8-aminoquinoline, is considered a tissue schizonticide drug
      for radical cure in vivax and ovale malaria, with minimal impact on asexual
      erythrocytic stages at therapeutic concentrations. Tafenoquine (TQ), a new
      8-aminoquinoline analog of PQ, is active against both malaria parasite tissue and
      blood stages and is being promoted as a drug candidate for antimalarial
      chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis and potential transmission blocking against
      Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. This study compared in vitro sensitivity of
      Thai P. falciparum isolates against three 8-aminoquinolines, PQ, TQ and
      sitamaquine (SQ), a related 8-aminoquinoline and assessed the importance of
      pfmdr1 polymorphism on the in vitro response. Seventy-eight laboratory adapted
      Thai P. falciparum isolates were evaluated for in vitro sensitivity to the three 
      8-aminoquinolines using a radioisotopic assay, and pfmdr1 polymorphisms were
      determined using PCR-based methods. All three drugs have weak antiplasmodial
      activity against asexual erythrocytic stage with SQ being the most potent by
      almost 10 folds. Cross susceptibility was observed in all three
      8-aminoquinolines. Parasites containing pfmdr1 86Y, 184Y or 1034S allele exhibit 
      significantly higher PQ IC(5)(0). TQ sensitivity was reduced in those parasites
      containing pfmdr1 86Y, 1034S or 1042N allele. However, there was no significant
      influence of pfmdr1 alleles on SQ sensitivity. The data highlight unique
      differences among three representative 8-aminoquinoline drugs that may be useful 
      in understanding their potential utility in antimalarial development.

TI  - National Malaria Prevalence in Cambodia: Microscopy Versus Polymerase Chain
      Reaction Estimates.
PG  - 588-94
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0908 [doi]
AB  - Accurate information regarding malaria prevalence at national level is required
      to design and assess malaria control/elimination efforts. Although many
      comparisons of microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have 
      been conducted, there is little published literature covering such comparisons in
      southeast Asia especially at the national level. Both microscopic examination and
      PCR detection were performed on blood films and dried blood spots samples
      collected from 8,067 individuals enrolled in a nationwide, stratified,
      multistage, cluster sampling malaria prevalence survey conducted in Cambodia in
      2007. The overall malaria prevalence and prevalence rates of Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium malariae infections estimated by
      microscopy (N = 8,067) were 2.74% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.39-3.12%),
      1.81% (95% CI: 1.53-2.13%), 1.14% (95% CI: 0.92-1.40%), and 0.01% (95% CI:
      0.003-0.07%), respectively. The overall malaria prevalence based on PCR detection
      (N = 7,718) was almost 2.5-fold higher (6.31%, 95% CI: 5.76-6.89%, P < 0.00001). 
      This difference was significantly more pronounced for P. falciparum (4.40%, 95%
      CI: 3.95-4.90%, P < 0.00001) compared with P. vivax (1.89%, 95% CI: 1.60-2.22%, P
      < 0.001) and P. malariae infections (0.22%, 95% CI: 0.13-0.35%, P < 0.0001). The 
      significant proportion of microscopy-negative but PCR-positive individuals
      (289/7,491, 3.85%) suggest microscopic examination frequently underestimated
      malaria infections and that active case detection based on microscopy may miss a 
      significant reservoir of infection, especially in low-transmission settings.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in human malaria cases in Mali.
PG  - 353
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1397-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Mali, Plasmodium falciparum malaria is highly endemic and remains 
      stable despite the implementation of various malaria control measures.
      Understanding P. falciparum population structure variations across the country
      could provide new insights to guide malaria control programmes. In this study, P.
      falciparum genetic diversity and population structure in regions of varying
      patterns of malaria transmission in Mali were analysed. METHODS: A total of 648
      blood isolates adsorbed onto filter papers during population surveillance surveys
      (December 2012-March 2013, October 2013) in four distinct sites of Mali were
      screened for the presence of P. falciparum via quantitative PCR (qPCR). Multiple 
      loci variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) using eight microsatellite
      markers was then performed on positive qPCR samples. Complete genotypes were then
      analysed for genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and linkage
      disequilibrium. RESULTS: Of 156 qPCR-positive samples, complete genotyping of 112
      samples was achieved. The parasite populations displayed high genetic diversity
      (mean He = 0.77), which was consistent with a high level of malaria transmission 
      in Mali. Genetic differentiation was low (FST < 0.02), even between sites located
      approximately 900 km apart, thereby illustrating marked gene flux amongst
      parasite populations. The lack of linkage disequilibrium further revealed an
      absence of local clonal expansion, which was corroborated by the genotype
      relationship results. In contrast to the stable genetic diversity level observed 
      throughout the country, mean multiplicity of infection increased from north to
      south (from 1.4 to 2.06) and paralleled malaria transmission levels observed
      locally. CONCLUSIONS: In Mali, the high level of genetic diversity and the
      pronounced gene flux amongst P. falciparum populations may represent an obstacle 
      to control malaria. Indeed, results suggest that parasite populations are
      polymorphic enough to adapt to their host and to counteract interventions, such
      as anti-malarial vaccination. Additionally, the panmictic parasite population
      structure imply that resistance traits may disseminate freely from one area to
      another, making control measures performed at a local level ineffective.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in infants and children
      with WHO stage 1 or 2 HIV disease: a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial.
PG  - 1134-44
LID - 10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30161-X [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major global public health concern, especially in
      sub-Saharan Africa. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine was reviewed by the 
      European Medicines Agency and received a positive scientific opinion; WHO
      subsequently recommended pilot implementation in sub-Saharan African countries.
      Because malaria and HIV overlap geographically, HIV-infected children should be
      considered for RTS,S/AS01 vaccination. We therefore aimed to assess the safety of
      RTS,S/AS01 in HIV-infected children at two sites in western Kenya. METHODS: We
      did a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial at the clinical trial sites of
      the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Walter Reed Army Institute of
      research in Kisumu and the KEMRI/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
      Siaya. Eligible participants were infants and children aged from 6 weeks to 17
      months with WHO stage 1 or 2 HIV disease (documented positive by DNA PCR),
      whether or not they were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). We randomly
      assigned participants (1:1) to receive three doses of either RTS,S/AS01 or rabies
      vaccine (both 0.5 mL per dose by intramuscular injection), given once per month
      at 0, 1, and 2 months. We did the treatment allocation using a web-based central 
      randomisation system stratified by age (6 weeks-4 months, 5-17 months), and by
      baseline CD4% (<10, 10-14, 15-19, and >/=20). Data were obtained in an
      observer-blind manner, and the vaccine recipient, their parent or carer, the
      funder, and investigators responsible for the assessment of endpoints were all
      masked to treatment allocation (only staff responsible for the preparation and
      administration of the vaccines were aware of the assignment and these individuals
      played no other role in the study). We provided ART, even if the participants
      were not receiving ART before the study, and daily co-trimoxazole for prevention 
      of opportunistic infections. The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious
      adverse events until 14 months after dose 1 of the vaccine, assessed in the
      intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
      number NCT01148459. FINDINGS: Between July 30, 2010, and May 24, 2013, we
      enrolled 200 children to our study and randomly assigned 99 to receive RTS,S/AS01
      and 101 to receive rabies vaccine. 177 (89%) of the 200 children enrolled
      completed 14 months of follow-up. Serious adverse events were noted in 41 (41.4%,
      95% CI 31.6-51.8) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 37 (36.6%, 27.3-46.8) of 101
      rabies-vaccine recipients (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.6). 20 (20.2%, 95% CI 
      12.8-29.5) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 12 (11.9%, 6.3-19.8) of 101
      rabies-vaccine recipients had at least one serious adverse event within 30 days
      after vaccination, mainly pneumonia, febrile convulsions, and salmonella sepsis. 
      Five (5.1%, 95% CI 1.7-11.4) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and four (4.0%, 1.1-9.8)
      of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients died, but no deaths were deemed related to
      vaccination. Mortality was associated with five cases of pneumonia (1% RTS,S/AS01
      recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of gastroenteritis (3%
      RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 2% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of
      malnutrition (2% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case
      of sepsis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of Haemophilus influenza
      meningitis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), and one case of tuberculosis (1%
      RTS,S/AS01 recipients). INTERPRETATION: RTS, S/AS01 was well tolerated when given
      to children with WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 HIV disease along with high
      antiretroviral and co-trimoxazole use. Children with HIV disease could be
      included in future RTS,S/AS01 vaccination programmes. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline

TI  - Low prevalence of Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale mono-infections among

      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 350
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1409-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an effort to improve surveillance for epidemiological and clinical
      outcomes, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become increasingly widespread as
      cost-effective and field-ready methods of malaria diagnosis. However, there are
      concerns that using RDTs specific to Plasmodium falciparum may lead to missed
      detection of other malaria species such as Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium
      ovale. METHODS: Four hundred and sixty six samples were selected from children
      under 5 years old in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who took part in 
      a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 2013-14. These samples were first tested
      for all Plasmodium species using an 18S ribosomal RNA-targeted real-time PCR;
      malaria-positive samples were then tested for P. falciparum, P. malariae and P.
      ovale using a highly sensitive nested PCR. RESULTS: The prevalence of P.
      falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale were 46.6, 12.9 and 8.3 %, respectively.
      Most P. malariae and P. ovale infections were co-infected with P. falciparum-the 
      prevalence of mono-infections of these species were only 1.0 and 0.6 %,
      respectively. Six out of these eight mono-infections were negative by RDT. The
      prevalence of P. falciparum by the more sensitive nested PCR was higher than that
      found previously by real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium malariae and P. ovale 
      remain endemic at a low rate in the DRC, but the risk of missing malarial
      infections of these species due to falciparum-specific RDT use is low. The
      observed prevalence of P. falciparum is higher with a more sensitive PCR method.

TI  - Is Nigeria winning the battle against malaria? Prevalence, risk factors and KAP
      assessment among Hausa communities in Kano State.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most severe global public health problems
      worldwide, particularly in Africa, where Nigeria has the greatest number of
      malaria cases. This community-based study was designed to investigate the
      prevalence and risk factors of malaria and to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, 
      and practices (KAP) regarding malaria among rural Hausa communities in Kano
      State, Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted on
      551 participants from five local government areas in Kano State. Blood samples
      were collected and examined for the presence of Plasmodium species by rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT), Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films, and PCR.
      Moreover, demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information as well as
      KAP data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 334
      (60.6 %) participants were found positive for Plasmodium falciparum. The
      prevalence differed significantly by age group (p < 0.01), but not by gender or
      location. A multivariate analysis showed that malaria was associated
      significantly with being aged 12 years or older, having a low household family
      income, not using insecticide treated nets (ITNs), and having no toilets in the
      house. Overall, 95.6 % of the respondents had prior knowledge about malaria, and 
      79.7, 87.6 and 95.7 % of them knew about the transmission, symptoms, and
      prevention of malaria, respectively. The majority (93.4 %) of the respondents
      considered malaria a serious disease. Although 79.5 % of the respondents had at
      least one ITN in their household, utilization rate of ITNs was 49.5 %.
      Significant associations between the respondents' knowledge concerning malaria
      and their age, gender, education, and household monthly income were reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is still highly prevalent among rural Hausa communities in
      Nigeria. Despite high levels of knowledge and attitudes in the study area,
      significant gaps persist in appropriate preventive practices, particularly the
      use of ITNs. Innovative and Integrated control measures to reduce the burden of
      malaria should be identified and implemented in these communities. Community
      mobilization and health education regarding the importance of using ITNs to
      prevent malaria and save lives should be considered.

      Undifferentiated Fever in India.
PG  - e0158816
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately one million malaria cases were reported in India in
      2015, based on microscopy. This study aims to assess the malaria prevalence among
      hospitalised fever patients in India identified by PCR, and to evaluate the
      performance of routine diagnostic methods. METHODS: During June 2011-December
      2012, patients admitted with acute undifferentiated fever to seven secondary
      level community hospitals in Assam (Tezpur), Bihar (Raxaul), Chhattisgarh
      (Mungeli), Maharashtra (Ratnagiri), Andhra Pradesh (Anantapur) and Tamil Nadu
      (Oddanchatram and Ambur) were included. The malaria prevalence was assessed by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), routine microscopy, and a rapid diagnostic test 
      (RDT) with PCR as a reference method. RESULTS: The malaria prevalence by PCR was 
      19% (268/1412) ranging from 6% (Oddanchatram, South India) to 35% (Ratnagiri,
      West India). Among malaria positive patients P. falciparum single infection was
      detected in 46%, while 38% had P. vivax, 11% mixed infections with P. falciparum 
      and P. vivax, and 5% P. malariae. Compared to PCR, microscopy had sensitivity of 
      29% and specificity of 98%, while the RDT had sensitivity of 24% and specificity 
      of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: High malaria prevalence was identified by PCR in this
      cohort. Routine diagnostic methods had low sensitivity compared to PCR. The
      results suggest that malaria is underdiagnosed in rural India. However, low
      parasitaemia controlled by immunity may constitute a proportion of PCR positive
      cases, which calls for awareness of the fact that other pathogens could be
      responsible for the febrile disease in submicroscopic malaria.

TI  - Association between Subclinical Malaria Infection and Inflammatory Host Response 
      in a Pre-Elimination Setting.
PG  - e0158656
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158656 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subclinical infections in endemic areas of Southeast Asia sustain
      malaria transmission. These asymptomatic infections might sustain immunity
      against clinical malaria and have been considered benign for the host, but if
      they are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation this could be harmful. We
      conducted a case-control study to explore the association between subclinical
      malaria and C-reactive protein (CRP), an established biomarker of inflammation.
      METHODS: Blood samples from asymptomatic villagers in Pailin, Western Cambodia
      were tested for malaria by high-volume ultra-sensitive polymerase chain reaction 
      (uPCR) to determine the Plasmodium species. Plasma CRP concentration was measured
      in 328 individuals with parasitaemia (cases) and compared with: i) the same
      individual's value at the first time point when they had no detectable parasites 
      (n = 282); and ii) age- sex- and village-matched controls (n = 328) free of
      Plasmodium infection. Plasma CRP concentrations were compared against thresholds 
      of 3mg/L and 10mg/L. Subgroup analysis was carried out for cases with P vivax and
      P falciparum mono-infections. RESULTS: Median plasma CRP level for all samples
      was 0.59mg/L (interquartile range: 0.24-1.64mg/L). CRP concentrations were higher
      in parasitaemic individuals compared with same-person-controls (p = 0.050); and
      matched-controls (p = 0.025). 4.9% of samples had CRP concentrations above 10mg/L
      and 14.6% were above 3mg/L. Cases were more likely to have plasma CRP
      concentrations above these thresholds than age/sex matched controls, odds ratio
      3.5 (95%CI 1.5-9.8) and 1.8 (95%CI 1.1-2.9), respectively. Amongst cases,
      parasite density and CRP were positively correlated (p<0.001), an association
      that remained significant when controlling for age and fever. Individuals with
      P.vivax mono-infections had the highest plasma CRP concentrations with the
      greatest association with parasitaemia. DISCUSSION: In this setting persistent
      malaria infections in asymptomatic individuals were associated with moderately
      elevated plasma CRP concentrations; chiefly evident in cases with P.vivax
      mono-infections. As well as interrupting malaria transmission within the
      community, treatment of asymptomatic malaria infections, in particular radical
      cure of vivax malaria, may benefit the health of infected individuals.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and effects of artesunate-amodiaquine and
      artemether-lumefantrine on malaria-associated anaemia in Nigerian children aged
      two years and under.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s40249-016-0165-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies are recommended as first-line
      treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but there is little evaluation
      of their efficacy and effects on uncomplicated malaria-associated anaemia in
      children aged 2 years and under. METHODS: Parasitological efficacy and effects on
      malaria-associated anaemia were evaluated in 250 malarious children aged 2 years 
      and under, and efficacy was evaluated in 603 malarious children older than two
      but younger than 5 years of age following treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine
      (AA) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Kinetics of the disposition of parasitaemia
      following treatment were evaluated using a non-compartment model. Late-appearing 
      anaemia (LAA) was diagnosed using the following criteria: clearance of
      parasitaemia, fever and other symptoms occurring within 7 days of starting
      treatment, adequate clinical and parasitological response on days 28-42,
      haematocrit (HCT) >/= 30 % at 1 and/or 2 weeks, a fall in HCT to < 30 % occurring
      at 3-6 weeks, absence of concomitant illness at 1-6 weeks, and absence of asexual
      parasitaemia detected using both microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      at 1-6 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, in children aged 2 years and under, the
      PCR-corrected parasitological efficacy was 97.2 % (95 % CI 92.8-101.6), which was
      similar for both treatments. In children older than 2 years, parasitological
      efficacy was also similar for both treatments, but parasite prevalence 1 day
      after treatment began was significantly higher, and fever and parasite clearance 
      times were significantly faster in the AA-treated children compared with the
      AL-treated children. Declines in parasitaemia were monoexponential with an
      estimated elimination half-time of 1 h. Elimination half-times were similar for
      both treatments. In children aged 2 years and under who were anaemic at
      presentation, the mean anaemia recovery time was 12.1 days (95 % CI 10.6-13.6, n 
      = 127), which was similar for both treatments. Relatively asymptomatic LAA
      occurred in 11 children (4.4 %) aged 2 years and under, the recovery from which
      was uneventful. CONCLUSION: This study showed that AA and AL are efficacious
      treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nigerian children aged 2 years
      and under, and that AA clears parasitaemia and fever significantly faster than AL
      in children older than 2 years. Both treatments may cause a relatively
      asymptomatic LAA with uneventful recovery in a small proportion of children aged 
      2 years and under. TRIALS REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trial Registry

      Detection of Malaria Infection during Pregnancy and at Delivery in Areas of
      Varied Transmission: A Prospective Cohort Study in Burkina Faso and Uganda.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent screening and treatment (IST) of malaria during
      pregnancy has been proposed as an alternative to intermittent preventive
      treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), where IPTp is failing due to drug resistance.
      However, the antenatal parasitaemias are frequently very low, and the most
      appropriate screening test for IST has not been defined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: We conducted a multi-center prospective study of 990 HIV-uninfected
      women attending ANC in two different malaria transmission settings at Tororo
      District Hospital, eastern Uganda and Colsama Health Center in western Burkina
      Faso. Women were enrolled in the study in the second or third trimester of
      pregnancy and followed to delivery, generating 2,597 blood samples for analysis. 
      Screening tests included rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting histidine-rich
      protein 2 (HRP2) and parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and microscopy,
      compared to nPCR as a reference standard. At enrolment, the proportion of
      pregnant women who were positive for P. falciparum by HRP2/pan pLDH RDT, Pf
      pLDH/pan pLDH RDT, microscopy and PCR was 38%, 29%, 36% and 44% in Uganda and
      21%, 16%, 15% and 35% in Burkina Faso, respectively. All test positivity rates
      declined during follow-up. In comparison to PCR, the sensitivity of the HRP2/pan 
      pLDH RDT, Pf pLDH/pan pLDH RDT and microscopy was 75.7%, 60.1% and 69.7% in
      Uganda, 55.8%, 42.6% and 55.8% in Burkina Faso respectively for all antenatal
      visits. Specificity was greater than 96% for all three tests. Comparison of
      accuracy using generalized estimating equation revealed that the HRP2- detecting 
      RDT was the most accurate test in both settings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The
      study suggests that HRP2-based RDTs are the most appropriate point-of-care test
      currently available for use during pregnancy especially for symptomatic women,
      but will still miss some PCR-positive women. The clinical significance of these
      very low density infections needs to be better defined.

AB  - Infection with the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a major cause
      of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the striking features of this
      parasite is its ability to remodel and decrease the deformability of host red
      blood cells, a process that contributes to disease. To further understand the
      virulence of Pf we investigated the biochemistry and function of a putative Pf
      S33 proline aminopeptidase (PfPAP). Unlike other P. falciparum aminopeptidases,
      PfPAP contains a predicted protein export element that is non-syntenic with other
      human infecting Plasmodium species. Characterization of PfPAP demonstrated that
      it is exported into the host red blood cell and that it is a prolyl
      aminopeptidase with a preference for N-terminal proline substrates. In addition
      genetic deletion of this exopeptidase was shown to lead to an increase in the
      deformability of parasite-infected red cells and in reduced adherence to the
      endothelial cell receptor CD36 under flow conditions. Our studies suggest that
      PfPAP plays a role in the rigidification and adhesion of infected red blood cells
      to endothelial surface receptors, a role that may make this protein a novel
      target for anti-disease interventions strategies.

TI  - Efficacy of topical mosquito repellent (picaridin) plus long-lasting insecticidal
      nets versus long-lasting insecticidal nets alone for control of malaria: a
      cluster randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although effective topical repellents provide personal protection
      against malaria, whether mass use of topical repellents in addition to
      long-lasting insecticidal nets can contribute to a further decline of malaria is 
      not known, particularly in areas where outdoor transmission occurs. We aimed to
      assess the epidemiological efficacy of a highly effective topical repellent in
      addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in reducing malaria prevalence in this
      setting. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial was done in the 117 most 
      endemic villages in Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, to assess the efficacy of
      topical repellents in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in controlling
      malaria in a low-endemic setting. We did a pre-trial assessment of village
      accessibility and excluded four villages because of their inaccessibility during 
      the rainy season. Another 25 villages were grouped because of their proximity to 
      each other, resulting in 98 study clusters (comprising either a single village or
      multiple neighbouring villages). Clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to either 
      a control (long-lasting insecticidal nets) or intervention (long-lasting
      insecticidal nets plus topical repellent) study group after a restricted
      randomisation. All clusters received one long-lasting insecticidal net per
      individual, whereas those in the intervention group also received safe and
      effective topical repellents (picaridin KBR3023, SC Johnson, Racine, WI, USA),
      along with instruction and promotion of its daily use. Cross-sectional surveys of
      65 randomly selected individuals per cluster were done at the beginning and end
      of the malaria transmission season in 2012 and 2013. The primary outcome was
      Plasmodium species-specific prevalence in participants obtained by real-time PCR,
      assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Complete safety analysis data will
      be published seperately; any ad-hoc adverse events are reported here. This trial 
      is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01663831. FINDINGS: Of the 98
      clusters that villages were split into, 49 were assigned to the control group and
      49 were assigned to the intervention group. Despite having a successful
      distribution system, the daily use of repellents was suboptimum. No
      post-intervention differences in PCR plasmodium prevalence were observed between 
      study groups in 2012 (4.91% in the control group vs 4.86% in the intervention
      group; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.01 [95% CI 0.60-1.70]; p=0.975) or in 2013
      (2.96% in the control group vs 3.85% in the intervention group; aOR 1.31
      [0.81-2.11]; p=0.266). Similar results were obtained according to Plasmodium
      species (1.33% of participants in the intervention group vs 1.10% in the
      intervention group were infected with Plasmodium falciparum; aOR 0.83
      [0.44-1.56]; p=0.561; and 1.85% in the control group vs 2.67% in the intervention
      group were infected with Plasmodium vivax; aOR 1.51 [0.88-2.57]; p=0.133). 41
      adverse event notifications from nine villages were received, of which 33 were
      classified as adverse reactions (11 of these 33 were cases of repellent abuse
      through oral ingestion, either accidental or not). All participants with adverse 
      reactions fully recovered and 17 were advised to permanently stop using the
      repellent. INTERPRETATION: Mass distribution of highly effective topical
      repellents in resource-sufficient conditions did not contribute to a further
      decline in malaria endemicity in a pre-elimination setting in the Greater Mekong 
      subregion. Daily compliance and appropriate use of the repellents remains the
      main obstacle. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THREE BLOOD GENOMIC-DNA PREPARATION METHODS FOR MALARIA MOLECULAR
      DIAGNOSIS.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Species-specific PCR techniques are highly sensitive and reliable alternatives to
      classical methods for malaria diagnosis and speciation, especially in endemic
      regions under advanced control or elimination programs where asymptomatic and
      low-density infections are increasingly reported. Nevertheless, the performance
      of these techniques is directly affected by the quality of isolated DNA
      templates. A Plasmodium falciparum/vivax-specific diagnostic Nested-PCR (Pf/Pv
      N-PCR) was used to assess three DNA preparation methods, Qiagen(R)
      Mini-Chromatographic kit (QIAmp(R)) and Jena-Biosciences(R) DNA isolation kit
      (JB(R)) for genomic DNA extraction from EDTA-preserved whole blood samples, and
      Whatman-FTA(R) purification reagent (FTA(R)) for DNA preparation from dry blood
      spots (DBS) collected onto FTA(R)- cards. A total of 84 out of 137 blood
      specimens collected from malaria suspicious febrile patients who visited five
      health care centres in south-western endemic localities of Saudi Arabia were
      found P. falciparum positive by at least one method. Among these, only 76 (90%)
      were reported P. falciparum malaria positive by two expert microscopists. No
      other species of Plasmodium were detected. Pf/Pv N-PCR revealed 84/84 (100%),
      75/84 (89%), and 81 (96%) P. falciparum positive samples using DNA templates
      prepared by QIAmp(R), JB(R), and FTA(R) purification methods, respectively.
      Therefore, Pf/Pv N-PCR, when applied to QIAmp(R) DNA templates showed to be a
      highly sensitive diagnostic method, particularly useful for submicroscopic
      specimens from clinically malaria suspicious patients in endemic areas. On the
      other hand, Pf/Pv N-PCR of FTA(R)-DBS DNA templates revealed 5 positive cases
      missed by microscopy, encouraging its use as an affordable field semi-adapted
      protocol for malaria active screening, especially in remqte rural regions with
      limited laboratory infrastructure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone a gametocyte specific protein Pfgdv1 of Plasmodium
      falciparum, express and identify recombinant Pfgdvl protein in vitro. METHODS:
      PCR was performed to amplify Pfgdv1 from P. falciparum DNA which was got from the
      patient who was infected with P. falciparum, and the PCR product was inserted
      into pET28a (+) vector. pET28a-Pfgdv1 recombinant plasmid was constructed and
      transformed into E. coli host BL21 (DE3+). IPTG was used to induce the
      recombinant Pfgdv1 protein fused with His tag, and the protein was purified by
      His-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was identified by
      SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RESULTS: The PCR product of Pfgdv1 gene was about 
      1.65 kb, meeting the expectation of predicted fragment size. The recombinant
      protein was about 67 kDa, which could be recognized by His-Tag monoclonal
      antibody. CONCLUSION: The Pfgdv1 gene of P. falciparum is successfully cloned,
      and the recombinant Pfgdv1 protein is expressed, thereby providing an opportunity
      for further study on transmission blocking vaccine.

TI  - Monitoring the efficacy of antimalarial medicines in India via sentinel sites:
      Outcomes and risk factors for treatment failure.
PG  - 168-78
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: To combat the problem of antimalarial drug resistance,
      monitoring the changes in drug efficacy over time through periodic surveillance
      is essential. Since 2009, systematic and continuous monitoring is being done
      through nationwide sentinel site system. Potential early warning signs like
      partner drug resistance markers were also monitored in the clinical samples from 
      the study areas. METHODS: A total of 1864 patients with acute uncomplicated
      malaria were enrolled in therapeutic efficacy studies of artesunate plus
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) for Plasmodium falciparum; those infected with
      P. vivax were given chloroquine (CQ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
      distinguish post-treatment reinfection from treatment failures. Isolates of P.
      falciparum were also analysed for dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and
      dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene mutations. RESULTS: Overall, 1687 (91.7%)
      patients completed the follow-up. In most of the falciparum patients the
      parasitaemia was cleared within 24 h of treatment, except 12 patients who
      remained parasite positive after 72 h. Presence of dhfr and dhps quintuple
      mutation was observed predominantly in treatment failure samples. A daily dose of
      artesunate of < 3 mg/kg of body weight, age of <5 yr, and fever at enrolment were
      associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. The AS+SP in P.
      falciparum was effective in > 95% cases in all the sentinel sites except in
      Northeastern region (NE). Chloroquine remained 100% efficacious in case of P.
      vivax infections. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Till 2012, India's national
      antimalarial drug resistance monitoring system proved highly efficacious and safe
      towards first-line antimalarials used in the country, except in Northeastern
      region where a decline in efficacy of AS+SP has been observed. This led to change
      in first-line treatment for P. falciparum to artemether-lumefantrine in
      Northeastern region.

TI  - Biting behaviour of Anopheles funestus populations in Mutare and Mutasa
      districts, Manicaland province, Zimbabwe: Implications for the malaria control
      programme.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Biting behaviour of Anopheles funestus in Mutare and
      Mutasa districts, Zimbabwe, is little understood. An investigation was conducted 
      to primarily compare indoor and outdoor biting behaviour of the mosquito, as well
      as blood meal sources and sporozoite rates. METHODS: Monthly adult anopheline
      sampling was conducted from October 2013 to September 2014 using Centers for
      Disease Control light-traps, pyrethrum spray catch and artificial pit shelter
      methods. Mosquitoes sampled by light-traps were divided into two cohorts. In one 
      cohort, traps were left overnight and mosquitoes were collected the following
      morning, while in the other set, mosquitoes were collected hourly from 1800-0600 
      hrs . Collected females were identified using morphological characters and
      categorised according to their abdominal status. Polymerase chain reaction was
      used to identify An. funestus sibling species and blood meal sources. Infection
      rate was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Morphological
      identification showed that indoor and outdoor catches comprised Anopheles
      funestus (98.3%) and Anopheles gambiae s.l. (1.7%). Of the 2268 mosquitoes
      collected, 66.2% were caught by light-traps, and 33.8% were caught resting
      indoors and outdoors. Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae s.l. were trapped more
      abundantly indoors (68%) than outdoors (32%). Both indoor and outdoor An.
      funestus densities were higher in wet (4.3) than dry season (1.8). In Burma
      Valley and Zindi areas, An. funestus demonstrated variable nocturnal indoor and
      outdoor flight activity rhythms, with two peaks during the night; between
      2200-2300 hrs and 0200- 0400 hrs. Human blood index in An. funestus was 0.64,
      with Plasmodium falciparum infection rate of 1.8%. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:
      The present work highlighted important information on the host-seeking behaviour,
      blood meal sources and infection rates in An. funestus. The information would be 
      helpful in improving the vector control strategies.

      from patients with uncomplicated and severe malaria in Gezira State, Sudan.
PG  - 362
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1641-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiplicity and genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum infection
      might play a role in determining the clinical outcome of malaria infection and
      could be a fair reflection of the disease transmission rate. This study
      investigated the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and multiplicity of infection
      in relation to the severity of malaria and age of patients in Gezira State,
      Sudan. METHODS: A cross-sectional health facilities-based survey was conducted in
      Gezira State, Sudan in January 2012. A total of 140 P. falciparum malaria
      patients diagnosed with microscopy and confirmed using nested PCR were recruited 
      and classified into uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria states according to 
      the standard WHO criteria. DNA was extracted and MSP1 and MSP2 allelic families
      were determined using nested PCR. RESULTS: The overall multiplicity of infection 
      (MOI) was 2.25 and 2.30 and 2.15 for uncomplicated and severe malaria
      respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between
      uncomplicated and severe malaria (SM) patient groups in MOI with regard to MSP1, 
      MSP2 and overall MOI (Mann-Whitney U-test; all P < 0.05). The predominant MSP1
      allelic families were MAD20 for uncomplicated malaria and RO33 for severe
      malaria. The distribution of both FC27 and IC1/3D7 MSP2 allelic families were
      approximately the same across disease severity. One hundred and eleven P.
      falciparum isolates (81 %) consisted of multiple genotypes; 71/90 (78.9 %) in
      uncomplicated malaria and 40/50 (85.1 %) in severe malaria patient groups.
      Neither MSP1 nor MSP2 allelic families showed association with malaria severity. 
      No statistically significant differences in multiplicity of infection were
      observed between different age groups. CONCLUSION: In this study the majority of 
      P. falciparum isolates from uncomplicated and severe malaria patients consisted
      of multiple genotypes. Further molecular epidemiological studies delineate the
      link between P. falciparum genotype with the malaria phenotype in different
      regions are encouraged.

      response to the high level of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine
      (CQ). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the frequency
      distribution of molecular markers associated with resistance to CQ and AS plus SP
      combination among P. falciparum isolates from a malaria-endemic area in Taiz
      governorate, Yemen. Fifty P. falciparum isolates were collected during a
      cross-sectional study in Mawza district, Taiz, in the period from October 2013 to
      April 2014. The isolates were investigated for drug resistance-associated
      molecular markers in five genes, including P. falciparum CQ resistance
      transporter (pfcrt) 76T and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) 86Y as 
      markers of resistance to CQ, mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) propeller domain for
      resistance to AS, and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and P.
      falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes for resistance to SP. Nested
      polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify target genes in DNA extracts of the
      isolates followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism for detecting 76T
      and 86Y mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1, respectively, and by DNA sequencing for
      detecting mutations in K13, pfdhfr and pfdhps. All the investigated isolates from
      Mawza district were harboring the pfcrt 76T mutant and the pfmdr1 N86 wild-type
      alleles. The pfdhfr 51I/108N double mutant allele was found in 2.2% (1/45) of the
      isolates; however, no mutations were detected at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and
      613 of pfdhps. All P. falciparum isolates that were successfully sequenced (n=47)
      showed the K13 Y493, R539, I543 and C580 wild-type alleles. In conclusion, the
      pfcrt 76T mutant allele is fixed in the study area about six years after the
      official withdrawal of CQ, possibly indicating its over-the-counter availability 
      and continued use as a self-medication in the study area. However, the almost
      predominant wild-type alleles of the genes associated with resistance to AS and
      SP among P. falciparum isolates in the present study indicates the sustained
      efficacy of the currently adopted first-line treatment of AS plus SP in the study
      area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) has not been studied with
      molecular means in hyperendemic areas where it is assumed to occur frequently.
      The African Investigation of the Mirasol System (AIMS) trial provided the
      opportunity to study TTM from standard whole blood (WB) units. STUDY DESIGN AND
      METHODS: The Plasmodium genome in transfused WB units and patient samples both
      before transfusion and 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after transfusion was screened and
      quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Parasitemic samples were
      confirmed, three alleles were sequenced, and the percentage homology was
      determined between paired WB units and patient samples. Anti-Plasmodium titers
      were quantified by serial dilution. Clinical symptoms and microscopic detection
      of malaria were monitored. RESULTS: Microscopy was negative below 3 x 10(6)
      genome copies/mL. Thirty-seven patients who were nonparasitemic before
      transfusion were exposed to parasitemic WB. The amount of Plasmodium genome load 
      transfused ranged between 0.1 x 10(6) and 2.0 x 10(9) copies. The parasite load
      received through transfusion by 13 patients with TTM was higher than that
      received by patients without TTM (p = 0.01). Patients with a single parasitemic
      posttransfusion sample were not considered to have TTM. Four elements critical to
      predict outcome emerged: parasite load, patient anti-Plasmodium titer
      pretransfusion, percentage clearance of parasites at Day 1, and level of
      anti-Plasmodium humoral immune response. Four patients with TTM became
      parasite-free at Day 28 (effective control), four patients with TTM maintained
      relatively stable levels of parasitemia (uncertain control), and five patients
      reached high levels of parasitemia at Day 28 posttransfusion, indicating
      ineffective control of malarial infection by semi-immune individuals.
      CONCLUSIONS: TTM in endemic areas is relatively frequent (13 of 112 donations;
      11.6%) and, although largely controlled by semi-immunity in recipient patients,
      may require antimalarial treatment.

TI  - Molecular monitoring of Plasmodium falciparum super-resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Tanzania.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1387-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for prophylactic
      treatment of malaria in pregnancy while artemisinin combination therapy is the
      recommended first-line anti-malarial treatment. Selection of SP resistance is
      ongoing since SP is readily available in health facilities and in private drug
      shops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study reports on the prevalence and
      distribution of Pfdhps mutations A540E and A581G in Tanzania. When found
      together, these mutations confer high-level SP resistance (sometimes referred to 
      as 'super-resistance'), which is associated with loss in protective efficacy of
      SP-IPTp. METHODS: DNA samples were extracted from malaria-positive blood samples 
      on filter paper, used malaria rapid diagnostic test strips and whole blood
      collected from eight sites in seven administrative regions of Tanzania. PCR-RFLP 
      and SSOP-ELISA techniques were used to genotype the A540E and A581G Pfdhps. Data 
      were analysed using SPSS version 18 while Chi square and/or Fischer Exact tests
      were used to compare prevalence between regions. RESULTS: A high inter-regional
      variation of Pfdhps-540E was observed (chi(2) = 76.8, p < 0.001). High
      inter-regional variation of 581G was observed (FE = 85.3, p < 0.001). Both Tanga 
      and Kagera were found to have the highest levels of SP resistance. A high
      prevalence of Pfdhps-581G was observed in Tanga (56.6 %) in northeastern Tanzania
      and in Kagera (20.4 %) in northwestern Tanzania and the 540-581 EG haplotype was 
      found at 54.5 and 19.4 %, respectively. Pfdhps-581G was not detected in Pwani and
      Lindi regions located south of Tanga region. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of SP
      super-resistant Pfdhps A581G is highest in northern Tanzania. Variation in
      distribution of SP resistance is observed across the country: northeastern Tanga 
      region and northwestern Kagera region have highest prevalence of SP
      super-resistance markers, while in Pwani and Lindi in the southeast the
      prevalence of super-resistance was zero. More studies should be conducted to
      understand the factors underlying the remarkable heterogeneity in SP resistance
      in the country.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy trial of artemisinin-based combination therapy for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria and investigation of mutations in k13
      propeller domain in Togo, 2012-2013.
PG  - 331
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1381-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2005, the Togo National Malaria Control Programme has
      recommended two different formulations of artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL), for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Regular efficacy monitoring of these two
      combinations is conducted every 2 or 3 years. This paper reports the latest
      efficacy assessment results and the investigation of mutations in the k13
      propeller domain. METHODS: The study was conducted in 2012-2013 on three sentinel
      sites of Togo (Lome, Sokode and Niamtougou). Children aged 6-59 months, who were 
      symptomatically infected with Plasmodium falciparum, were treated with either AL 
      (Coartem((R)), Novartis Pharma, Switzerland) or ASAQ (Co-Arsucam((R)), Sanofi
      Aventis, France). The WHO standard protocol for anti-malarial treatment
      evaluation was used. The primary end-point was 28-day adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR), corrected to exclude reinfection using
      polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. RESULTS: A total of 523 children were
      included in the study. PCR-corrected ACPR was 96.3-100 % for ASAQ and 97-100 %
      for AL across the three study sites. Adverse events were negligible: 0-4.8 %
      across all sites, for both artemisinin-based combinations. Upon investigation of 
      mutations in the k13 propeller domain, only 9 (1.8 %) mutations were reported,
      three in each site. All mutant parasites were cleared before day 3. All day 3
      positive patients were infected with k13 wild type parasites. CONCLUSIONS: The
      efficacy of AL and ASAQ remains high in Togo, and both drugs are well tolerated. 
      ASAQ and AL would be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in
      Togo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite largely successful control efforts, malaria remains a
      significant public health problem in Thailand. Based on microscopy, the
      northwestern province of Tak, once Thailand's highest burden area, is now
      considered a low-transmission region. However, microscopy is insensitive to
      detect low-level parasitaemia, causing gross underestimation of parasite
      prevalence in areas where most infections are subpatent. The objective of this
      study was to assess the current epidemiology of malaria prevalence using
      molecular and serological detection methods, and to profile the antibody
      responses against Plasmodium as it relates to age, seasonal changes and clinical 
      manifestations during infection. Three comprehensive cross-sectional surveys were
      performed in a sentinel village and from febrile hospital patients, and whole
      blood samples were collected from infants to elderly adults. Genomic DNA isolated
      from cellular fraction was screened by quantitative-PCR for the presence of
      Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale
      and Plasmodium knowlesi. Plasma samples were probed on protein microarray to
      obtain antibody response profiles from the same individuals. RESULTS: Within the 
      studied community, 90.2 % of Plasmodium infections were submicroscopic and
      asymptomatic, including a large number of mixed-species infections. Amongst
      febrile patients, mixed-species infections comprised 68 % of positive cases, all 
      of which went misdiagnosed and undertreated. All samples tested showed
      serological reactivity to Plasmodium antigens. There were significant differences
      in the rates of antibody acquisition against P. falciparum and P. vivax, and
      age-related differences in species-specific immunodominance of response.
      Antibodies against Plasmodium increased along the ten-month study period. Febrile
      patients had stronger antibody responses than asymptomatic carriers. CONCLUSIONS:
      Despite a great decline in malaria prevalence, transmission is still ongoing at
      levels undetectable by traditional methods. As current surveillance methods focus
      on case management, malaria transmission in Thailand will not be interrupted if
      asymptomatic submicroscopic infections are not detected and treated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections compromise
      dendritic cell (DC) function and expand regulatory T (Treg) cells in both
      clinical disease (malaria) and experimental human sub-microscopic infection.
      Conversely, in asymptomatic microscopy-positive (patent) P. falciparum or P.
      vivax infection in endemic areas, blood DC increase or retain HLA-DR expression
      and Treg cells exhibit reduced activation, suggesting that DC and Treg cells
      contribute to the control of patent asymptomatic infection. The effect of
      sub-microscopic (sub-patent) asymptomatic Plasmodium infection on DC and Treg
      cells in malaria-endemic area residents remains unclear. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional household survey conducted in Papua, Indonesia, 162 asymptomatic 
      adults were prospectively evaluated for DC and Treg cells using field-based flow 
      cytometry. Of these, 161 individuals (99 %) were assessed retrospectively by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 19 of whom had sub-microscopic infection with P.
      falciparum and 15 with sub-microscopic P. vivax infection. Flow cytometric data
      were re-analysed after re-grouping asymptomatic individuals according to PCR
      results into negative controls, sub-microscopic and microscopic parasitaemia to
      examine DC and Treg cell phenotype in sub-microscopic infection. RESULTS:
      Asymptomatic adults with sub-microscopic P. falciparum or P. vivax infection had 
      DC HLA-DR expression and Treg cell activation comparable to PCR-negative
      controls. Sub-microscopic P. falciparum infection was associated with lower
      peripheral CD4(+) T cells and lymphocytes, however sub-microscopic Plasmodium
      infection had no apparent effect on DC sub-set number or Treg cell frequency.
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the impairment of DC maturation/function and the
      activation of Treg cells seen with sub-microscopic parasitaemia in primary
      experimental human Plasmodium infection, no phenotypic evidence of dysregulation 
      of DC and Treg cells was observed in asymptomatic sub-microscopic Plasmodium
      infection in Indonesian adults. This is consistent with DC and Treg cells
      retaining their functional capacity in sub-microscopic asymptomatic infection
      with P. falciparum or P. vivax in malaria-endemic areas.

AB  - Estimates of malaria transmission intensity (MTI) typically rely upon microscopy 
      or rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). However, these methods are less sensitive than
      nucleic acid amplification techniques and may underestimate parasite prevalence. 
      We compared microscopy, RDT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
      diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia as part of an MTI study of 800
      children and adults conducted in Lilongwe, Malawi. PCR detected more cases of
      parasitemia than microscopy or RDT. Age less than 5 years predicted parasitemia
      detected by PCR alone (adjusted odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval =
      1.09-2.38, Wald P = 0.02). In addition, we identified one P. falciparum parasite 
      with a false-negative RDT result due to a suspected deletion of the
      histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2) gene and used a novel, ultrasensitive PCR assay
      to detect low-level parasitemia missed by traditional PCR. Molecular methods
      should be considered for use in future transmission studies as a supplement to
      RDT or microscopy.

      of Plasmodium vivax Malaria from Primary Care Centres in Southwestern India.
PG  - e0157666
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0157666 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports of chloroquine treatment failure and resistance in
      Plasmodium vivax malaria from Southeast Asian countries have been published.
      Present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine
      (CQ-PQ) combined regimen for the treatment of P. vivax malaria patients who were 
      catered by the selected primary health centres (PHCs) of Udupi taluk, Udupi
      district, Karnataka, India. METHOD: Five PHCs were selected within Udupi taluk
      based on probability proportional to size. In-vivo therapeutic efficacy
      assessment of CQ (1500 mg over three days) plus PQ (210 mg over 14 days) regimen 
      was carried out in accordance with the World Health Organization's protocol of 28
      days follow-up among microscopically diagnosed monoinfection P. vivax cohort.
      RESULTS: In total, 161 participants were recruited in the study of which, 155
      (96.3%) participants completed till day 28 follow-up, fully complied with the
      treatment regimen and showed adequate clinical and parasitological response. Loss
      to follow up was noted with 5 (3.1%) participants and non-compliance with
      treatment regimen occurred with one participant (0.6%). Glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd, <30% of normal mean activity) was noted among 5 
      (3.1%) participants and one of them did develop PQ induced dark-brown urination
      which subsided after PQ discontinuation. G6PDd patients were treated with PQ 45
      mg/week for eight weeks while PQ was discontinued in one case with G6PD 1.4 U/g
      Hb due to complaint of reddish-brown coloured urine by 48 hours of PQ initiation.
      Nested polymerase chain reaction test revealed 45 (28%) cases as mixed (vivax and
      falciparum) malaria. CONCLUSIONS: The CQ-PQ combined regimen remains
      outstandingly effective to treat uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Udupi taluk
      and thus it should continue as first line regimen. For all P. vivax cases, G6PD
      screening before PQ administration must be mandatory and made available in all
      PHCs.

TI  - Declining Efficacy of Artemisinin Combination Therapy Against P. Falciparum
      Malaria on the Thai-Myanmar Border (2003-2013): The Role of Parasite Genetic
      Factors.
PG  - 784-791
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciw388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deployment of mefloquine-artesunate (MAS3) on the Thailand-Myanmar
      border has led to a sustained reduction in falciparum malaria, although
      antimalarial efficacy has declined substantially in recent years. The role of
      Plasmodium falciparum K13 mutations (a marker of artemisinin resistance) in
      reducing treatment efficacy remains controversial. METHODS: Between 2003 and
      2013, we studied the efficacy of MAS3 in 1005 patients with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria in relation to molecular markers of resistance. RESULTS:
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted cure rates declined from 100% in 2003 to
      81.1% in 2013 as the proportions of isolates with multiple Pfmdr1 copies doubled 
      from 32.4% to 64.7% and those with K13 mutations increased from 6.7% to 83.4%.
      K13 mutations conferring moderate artemisinin resistance (notably E252Q)
      predominated initially but were later overtaken by propeller mutations associated
      with slower parasite clearance (notably C580Y). Those infected with both multiple
      Pfmdr1 copy number and a K13 propeller mutation were 14 times more likely to fail
      treatment. The PCR-adjusted cure rate was 57.8% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      45.4, 68.3) compared with 97.8% (95% CI, 93.3, 99.3) in patients with K13 wild
      type and Pfmdr1 single copy. K13 propeller mutation alone was a strong risk
      factor for recrudescence (P = .009). The combined population attributable
      fraction of recrudescence associated with K13 mutation and Pfmdr1 amplification
      was 82%. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of K13 mutations was the decisive
      factor for the recent and rapid decline in efficacy of artemisinin-based
      combination (MAS3) on the Thailand-Myanmar border.

AB  - The technical challenges of working with the sexual stages of the malaria
      parasite Plasmodium have hindered the characterization of sexual stage antigens
      in the quest for a successful malaria transmission-blocking vaccine. One such
      predicted and largely uncharacterized group of sexual stage candidate antigens is
      the CPW-WPC family of proteins. CPW-WPC proteins are named for a characteristic
      domain that contains two conserved motifs, CPxxW and WPC. Conserved across
      Apicomplexa, this family is also present earlier in the Alveolata in the
      free-living, non-parasitophorous, photosynthetic chromerids, Chromera and
      Vitrella. In Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei blood stage parasites, 
      the transcripts of all nine cpw-wpc genes have been detected in gametocytes. RNA 
      immunoprecipitation followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR reveals all P. berghei 
      cpw-wpc transcripts to be bound by the translational repressors DOZI and CITH,
      and thus are likely under translational control prior to transmission from the
      rodent host to the mosquito vector in P. berghei. The GFP tagging of two
      endogenous P. berghei genes confirmed translational silencing in the gametocyte
      and translation in ookinetes. By establishing a luciferase transgene assay, we
      show that the 3' untranslated region of PF3D7_1331400 controls protein expression
      of this reporter in P. falciparum gametocytes. Our analyses suggest that cpw-wpc 
      genes are translationally silenced in gametocytes across Plasmodium spp. and
      activated during ookinete formation and thus may have a role in transmission to
      the mosquito.

LID - 10.1089/vbz.2015.1921 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure prevalence of prior/current Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium
      falciparum (PV and PF), Brucella spp. (BR), dengue virus (DENV), Leishmania
      donovani (visceral leishmaniasis; VL), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
      virus exposure among Afghan National Army (ANA) recruits. METHODS: Randomly
      chosen, nationally representative serum samples from consenting men aged 18-40
      years and who were screened between February 2010 and January 2011 were tested,
      with approximately 25 samples/province. Samples were screened for PV and PF
      antigens and VL antibody with rapid diagnostic tests. Reactive malaria screening 
      results were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction assay. Enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays were used to screen for CCHF and DENV antibodies; reactive
      DENV samples were confirmed with the plaque-reduction neutralization test. BR
      screening and confirmatory testing was performed with slide and tube
      agglutination, respectively. Correlates of BR titres >1:80 were analyzed using
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 809 participants contributing specimens, 62% had
      previously lived outside Afghanistan, predominantly in Pakistan and Iran. CCHF
      (4.1%, n = 33), DENV (2.1%, n = 17), and VL (1.0%, n = 8) antibody prevalence was
      low. For PV and PF, only 7 out of 56 reactive samples had detectable nucleic
      acid. For BR, 8.0% (n = 65) of samples had screening titers >1:40, of which 83.1%
      had confirmatory titers >1:80. Participants from Kabul and surrounding provinces 
      had lower odds (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-1.00) of BR antibody compared with other 
      regions. CONCLUSIONS: BR exposure was relatively common with a nearly national
      distribution, whereas geographic distribution for other pathogens aligned roughly
      with the expected vector distribution. Public health protection measures should
      include vector control, food safety, and enhanced diagnostics for acute febrile
      illness.

TI  - Changes in malaria burden and transmission in sentinel sites after the roll-out
      of long-lasting insecticidal nets in Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 340
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1635-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea exhibits a complex malaria epidemiology due to
      diversity in malaria parasites, mosquito vectors, human hosts, and their natural 
      environment. Heterogeneities in transmission and burden of malaria at various
      scales are likely to affect the success of malaria control interventions, and
      vice-versa. This manuscript assesses changes in malaria prevalence, incidence and
      transmission in sentinel sites following the first national distribution of
      long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). METHODS: Before and after the
      distribution of LLINs, data collection in six purposively selected sentinel sites
      included clinical surveillance in the local health facility, household surveys
      and entomological surveys. Not all activities were carried out in all sites.
      Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches. Diagnosis of malaria
      infection in humans was done by rapid diagnostic test, light microscopy and PCR
      for species confirmation. RESULTS: Following the roll-out of LLINs, the average
      monthly malaria incidence rate dropped from 13/1,000 population to 2/1,000
      (incidence rate ratio = 0.12; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.17; P < 0.001). The average
      population prevalence of malaria decreased from 15.7 % pre-LLIN to 4.8 %
      post-LLIN (adjusted odds ratio = 0.26; 95 % CI: 0.20-0.33; P < 0.001). In
      general, reductions in incidence and prevalence were more pronounced in
      infections with P. falciparum than with P. vivax. Additional morbidity indicators
      (anaemia, splenomegaly, self-reported fever) showed a decreasing trend in most
      sites. Mean Anopheles man biting rates decreased from 83 bites/person/night
      pre-LLIN to 31 post-LLIN (P = 0.008). Anopheles species composition differed
      between sites but everywhere diversity was lower post-LLIN. In two sites,
      post-LLIN P. vivax infections in anophelines had decreased but P. falciparum
      infections had increased despite the opposite observation in humans. CONCLUSIONS:
      LLIN distribution had distinct effects on P. falciparum and P. vivax. Higher
      resilience of P. vivax may be attributed to relapses from hypnozoites and other
      biological characteristics favouring the transmission of P. vivax. The effect on 
      vector species composition varied by location which is likely to impact on the
      effectiveness of LLINs. In-depth and longer-term epidemiological and
      entomological investigations are required to understand when and where residual
      transmission occurs and whether observed changes are sustained.

      resistance has been observed in this area since 2008-2009 and molecular
      signatures associated to artemisinin resistance have been characterized in k13
      gene. At present, one of the major threats faced, is the possible spread of Asian
      artemisinin resistant parasites over the world threatening millions of people and
      jeopardizing malaria elimination programme efforts. To anticipate the diffusion
      of artemisinin resistance, the identification of the P. falciparum population
      structure and the gene flow among the parasite population in Cambodia are
      essential. METHODS: To this end, a mid-throughput PCR-LDR-FMA approach based on
      LUMINEX technology was developed to screen for genetic barcode in 533 blood
      samples collected in 2010-2011 from 16 health centres in malaria endemics areas
      in Cambodia. RESULTS: Based on successful typing of 282 samples, subpopulations
      were characterized along the borders of the country. Each 11-loci barcode
      provides evidence supporting allele distribution gradient related to
      subpopulations and gene flow. The 11-loci barcode successfully identifies
      recently emerging parasite subpopulations in western Cambodia that are associated
      with the C580Y dominant allele for artemisinin resistance in k13 gene. A
      subpopulation was identified in northern Cambodia that was associated to
      artemisinin (R539T resistant allele of k13 gene) and mefloquine resistance.
      CONCLUSIONS: The gene flow between these subpopulations might have driven the
      spread of artemisinin resistance over Cambodia.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum, the major cause of malaria morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, is only distantly related to other human malaria parasites and has
      thus been placed in a separate subgenus, termed Laverania Parasites
      morphologically similar to P. falciparum have been identified in African apes,
      but only one other Laverania species, Plasmodium reichenowi from chimpanzees, has
      been formally described. Although recent studies have pointed to the existence of
      additional Laverania species, their precise number and host associations remain
      uncertain, primarily because of limited sampling and a paucity of parasite
      sequences other than from mitochondrial DNA. To address this, we used limiting
      dilution polymerase chain reaction to amplify additional parasite sequences from 
      a large number of chimpanzee and gorilla blood and fecal samples collected at two
      sanctuaries and 30 field sites across equatorial Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of
      more than 2,000 new sequences derived from the mitochondrial, nuclear, and
      apicoplast genomes revealed six divergent and well-supported clades within the
      Laverania parasite group. Although two of these clades exhibited deep
      subdivisions in phylogenies estimated from organelle gene sequences, these
      sublineages were geographically defined and not present in trees from four
      unlinked nuclear loci. This greatly expanded sequence data set thus confirms six,
      and not seven or more, ape Laverania species, of which P. reichenowi, Plasmodium 
      gaboni, and Plasmodium billcollinsi only infect chimpanzees, whereas Plasmodium
      praefalciparum, Plasmodium adleri, and Pladmodium blacklocki only infect
      gorillas. The new sequence data also confirm the P. praefalciparum origin of
      human P. falciparum.

TI  - Decline in frequency of the 2La chromosomal inversion in Anopheles gambiae (s.s.)
      in Western Kenya: correlation with increase in ownership of insecticide-treated
      bed nets.
PG  - 334
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1621-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2La chromosomal inversion, a genetic polymorphism in An. gambiae 
      (sensu stricto) (s.s.), is associated with adaptation to microclimatic
      differences in humidity and desiccation resistance and mosquito behaviors.
      Ownership of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) for malaria control has
      increased markedly in western Kenya in the last 20 years. An increase in the
      frequency of ITNs indoors could select against house entering or indoor resting
      of Anopheles mosquitoes. Thus, the frequency of the 2La inversion is postulated
      to change in An. gambiae (s.s.) with the increase of ITN ownership over time.
      METHODS: Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were sampled between 1994 and 2011 using
      pyrethrum knockdown, bednet traps and human landing catches (HLC) from Asembo and
      Seme, western Kenya. The 2La inversion was detected by a PCR assay with primers
      designed for proximal breakpoints of the 2La/a and 2L+(a)/+(a) chromosomal
      conformation. Mosquitoes were tested for malaria parasite infection by sporozoite
      ELISA. RESULTS: The frequency of the 2La chromosomal inversion declined from 100 
      % of all chromosomes in 1994 to 17 % in 2005 and remained low through 2011 (21
      %). ITN ownership increased from 0 to > 90 % of houses in the study area during
      this interval. The decline in the frequency of the 2La chromosomal inversion was 
      significantly, negatively correlated with year (r = -0.93) and with increase in
      ITN ownership (r = -0.96). The frequency of the homo- and heterokaryotypes
      departed significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting that 2La/a
      karyotype was under selection, earlier in its favor and later, against it.
      Precipitation and maximum monthly temperature did not vary over time, therefore
      there was no trend in climate that could account for the decline. There was no
      significant difference in frequency of the 2La inversion in An. gambiae (s.s.)
      females sampled indoors or outdoors in HCL in 2011, nor was there an association 
      between the 2La inversion and infection with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites.
      CONCLUSIONS: The increase in ITN ownership in the study area was negatively
      correlated with the frequency of 2La inversion. The decline in 2La frequency in
      western Kenya is postulated to be due to differential impacts of ITNs on
      mosquitoes with different 2La karyotypes, possibly mediated by differences in
      behavior associated with the 2La karyotypes. Further research is required to
      determine if this is a widespread phenomenon, to further determine the
      association of the 2La karyotypes with mosquito behavior, and to assess whether
      ITNs are exerting selection mediated by differences in behavior on the different 
      karyotypes.

TI  - Uncomplicated Clinical Malaria Features, the Efficacy of Artesunate-Amodiaquine
      and Their Relation with Multiplicity of Infection in the Democratic Republic of
      Congo.
PG  - e0157074
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0157074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Democratic Republic of Congo, artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) is
      the first-line medication recommended for uncomplicated malaria treatment. We
      conducted a study in Kinshasa to describe the clinical features of the disease
      and assess the efficacy of ASAQ and its impact on the multiplicity of infection
      in children with uncomplicated malaria. METHODS: Children aged 12 to 59 months
      with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were treated with ASAQ and followed up
      passively for 42 days. To distinguish new infections from recrudescent parasites,
      samples were genotyped using a stepwise strategy with three molecular markers
      (GLURP, MSP2 and MSP1). We then assessed PCR-corrected and -uncorrected day-42
      cure rates and multiplicity of infection (MOI). RESULTS: In total, 2,796 patients
      were screened and 865 enrolled in the study. Clinical features were characterized
      by history of fever (100%), coryza (59.9%) and weakness (59.4%). The crude and
      PCR-corrected efficacies of ASAQ were 55.3% (95%CI: 51.8-58.8) and 92.8% (95%CI: 
      91.0-94.6) respectively, as 83.6% (95%CI: 79.1-87.2) of the recurrences were new 
      infections. Compared to monoclonal infections, polyclonal infections were more
      frequent at enrollment (88.1%) and in recurrences (80.1%; p = 0.005; OR: 1.8,
      95%CI: 1.20-2.8). The median MOI at enrollment (MOI = 3.7; IQR: 0.7-6.7)
      decreased to 3 (IQR: 1-5) in the recurrent samples (p<0.001). Patients infected
      with a single haplotype on day 0 had no recrudescence; the risk of recrudescence 
      increased by 28% with each additional haplotype (HR: 1.3, 95%CI: 1.24-1.44).
      CONCLUSION: The PCR-corrected efficacy of ASAQ at day 42 was 92.8%, but crude
      efficacy was relatively poor due to high reinfection rates. Treatment outcomes
      were positively correlated with MOI. Continued monitoring of the efficacy of
      ACTs-ASAQ, in this case-is paramount. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - Malaria pathogenesis may be influenced by IgE responses and cytokine
      cross-regulation. Several mutations in the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway can alter
      cytokine cross-regulation and IgE responses during a Plasmodium falciparum
      malarial infection. This study investigated the relationship between a STAT6
      intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs3024974), total IgE, cytokines, and
      malaria severity in 238 Ghanaian children aged between 0.5 and 13 years. Total
      IgE and cytokine levels were measured by ELISA, while genotyping was done by
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
      Compared with healthy controls, heterozygosity protected against clinical
      malaria: uncomplicated malaria (odds ratios [OR] = 0.13, P < 0.001), severe
      malarial anemia (OR = 0.18, P < 0.001), and cerebral malaria (OR = 0.39, P =
      0.022). Levels of total IgE significantly differed among malaria phenotypes (P = 
      0.044) and rs3024974 genotypes (P = 0.037). Neither cytokine levels nor
      IL-6/IL-10 ratios were associated with malaria phenotypes or rs3024974 genotypes.
      This study suggests a role for rs3024974 in malaria pathogenesis and offers
      further insights into an IL-4/STAT6 pathway mutation in malaria pathogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: OZ439, or artefenomel, is an investigational synthetic ozonide
      antimalarial with similar potency, but a significantly improved pharmacokinetic
      profile, compared with artemisinins. We wished to measure key pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic parameters and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship
      of artefenomel in humans to guide the drug's further development as combination
      therapy in patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested artefenomel in the human
      induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model. Plasmodium infection was monitored by
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) and upon reaching 1000 parasites/mL single doses of 100, 
      200 and 500 mg of artefenomel were administered orally with evaluation of drug
      exposure and parasitaemia until rescue treatment after 16 days or earlier, if
      required. RESULTS: A single 100 mg dose had only a transient effect, while the
      200 mg dose resulted in a significant reduction in parasitaemia before early
      recrudescence. At the highest (500 mg) dose, initial clearance of parasites below
      the limit of detection of qPCR was observed, with a 48 h parasite reduction ratio
      (PRR48) >10 000 and a parasite clearance half-life of 3.6 h (95% CI 3.4-3.8 h).
      However, at this dose, recrudescence was seen in four of eight subjects 6-10 days
      after treatment. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling predicted an MIC of
      4.1 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the antimalarial potential of
      artefenomel for use in a single-exposure combination therapy. The observations
      from this study support and will assist further clinical development of
      artefenomel.

TI  - Low-grade sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum parasites
      from Lubango, Angola.
PG  - 309
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1358-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major parasitic disease, affecting millions of people in
      endemic areas. Plasmodium falciparum parasites are responsible for the most
      severe cases and its resistance to anti-malarial drugs is notorious. This is a
      possible obstacle to the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
      based on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) cures administrated to pregnant women
      (IPTp) during their pregnancy. As this intervention is recommended in Angola
      since 2006, it has assessed, in this country, the molecular profiles in P.
      falciparum dhfr and dhps, two polymorphic genes associated to pyrimethamine and
      sulfadoxine resistance, respectively. METHODS: Blood samples from 52 falciparum
      patients were collected in Lubango, Angola and pfdhfr and pfdhps polymorphisms
      were analysed using nested-PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In the pfdhfr gene,
      the 108N mutation was almost fixed (98 %), followed by 59R (63 %), 51I (46 %),
      50R and 164L (2 %, respectively). No 16V/S mutations were found. The most common 
      double mutant genotype was CNRN (59 + 108; 46 %), followed by CICN (51 + 108; 29 
      %) whereas IRN (51 + 59 + 108; 15 %), CNRNVL (59 + 108 + 164; 2 %) and RICN (50 +
      51 + 108; 2 %) triple mutant genotypes were detected. Investigations of the
      pfdhps gene showed that the 437G mutation was the most prevalent (97 %). Only two
      and one samples disclosed the 540E (7 %) and the 436A (3 %), respectively. Single
      mutant SGKAA (437; 86 %) was higher than SGEAA (437 + 540; 7 %) or AGKAA (436 +
      437; 3 %) double mutants genotypes. No polymorphism was detected at codons 581G
      and 613T/S. Combining pfdhfr and pfdhps alleles two triple mutant haplotypes
      (double mutant in dhfr and single mutant in dhps) were observed: the
      ACICNVI/SGKAA in 14 (56 %) samples and the ACNRNVI/SGKAA in five (20 %) samples. 
      One quadruple mutant haplotype was detected (ACIRNVI/SGKAA) in six (24 %) P.
      falciparum samples. No quintuple pfdhfr-pfdhps mutant was noted. CONCLUSION:
      pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutations in isolates from Lubango are suggestive of a
      low-grade SP resistance and IPT for pregnant women and infant based on SP
      treatment could be effective. Routine molecular studies targeting polymorphism in
      these two genes need to be routinely conducted at country level.

AB  - The study of genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum is necessary to
      understand the distribution and dynamics of parasite populations. The genetic
      diversity of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 and 2 has been extensively
      studied from different parts of world. However, limited data are available from
      India. This study was aimed to determine the genetic diversity and multiplicity
      of infection (MOI) of P. falciparum population in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. A 
      total of 80day-zero blood samples from Kolkata were collected during a
      therapeutic efficacy study in 2008-2009. DNA was extracted; allelic frequency and
      diversity were investigated by PCR-genotyping method for msp1 and msp2 gene and
      fragment sizing was done by Bio-Rad Gel-Doc system using Image Lab (version 4.1) 
      software. P. falciparum msp1 and msp2 markers were highly polymorphic with low
      allele frequencies. In Kolkata, 27 msp1 different genotypes (including 11of K1, 6
      of MAD20 and 10 of Ro33 allelic families) and 30 different msp2 genotypes (of
      which 17 and 13 belonged to the FC27 and 3D7 allelic families, respectively) were
      recorded. The majority of these genotypes occurred at a frequency below 10%. The 
      mean MOI for msp1 and msp2 gene were 2.05 and 3.72, respectively. The P.
      falciparum population of Kolkata was genetically diverse. As the frequencies of
      most of the msp1 and msp2 alleles were low, the probability of new infection with
      genotype identical to that in pretreatment infection was very rare. This
      information will serve as baseline data for evaluation of malaria control
      interventions as well as for monitoring the parasite population structure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The East African highlands are fringe regions between stable and
      unstable malaria transmission. What factors contribute to the heterogeneity of
      malaria exposure on different spatial scales within larger foci has not been
      extensively studied. In a comprehensive, community-based cross-sectional survey
      an attempt was made to identify factors that drive the macro- and micro
      epidemiology of malaria in a fringe region using parasitological and serological 
      outcomes. METHODS: A large cross-sectional survey including 17,503 individuals
      was conducted across all age groups in a 100 km(2) area in the Western Kenyan
      highlands of Rachuonyo South district. Households were geo-located and prevalence
      of malaria parasites and malaria-specific antibodies were determined by PCR and
      ELISA. Household and individual risk-factors were recorded. Geographical
      characteristics of the study area were digitally derived using high-resolution
      satellite images. RESULTS: Malaria antibody prevalence strongly related to
      altitude (1350-1600 m, p < 0.001). A strong negative association with increasing 
      altitude and PCR parasite prevalence was found. Parasite carriage was detected at
      all altitudes and in all age groups; 93.2 % (2481/2663) of malaria infections
      were apparently asymptomatic. Malaria parasite prevalence was associated with
      age, bed net use, house construction features, altitude and topographical wetness
      index. Antibody prevalence was associated with all these factors and distance to 
      the nearest water body. CONCLUSION: Altitude was a major driver of malaria
      transmission in this study area, even across narrow altitude bands. The large
      proportion of asymptomatic parasite carriers at all altitudes and the
      age-dependent acquisition of malaria antibodies indicate stable malaria
      transmission; the strong correlation between current parasite carriage and
      serological markers of malaria exposure indicate temporal stability of spatially 
      heterogeneous transmission.

      in Parasite Clearance Following Drug Administration.
PG  - 753-61
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of drug-resistant malaria highlights the need for new
      agents. A desired characteristic of candidate antimalarials is rapid killing of
      parasites. This is typically measured by the rate of exponential clearance of
      parasitemia following treatment. However, this clearance rate excludes the highly
      variable lag phase, when the parasitemia level may increase, remain constant, or 
      decrease. Understanding factors determining this lag phase is important for drug 
      development. METHODS: We assessed the kinetics of parasitemia in 112 volunteers
      infected with blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum and treated with 8 different
      antimalarials. The parasitemia level was measured by quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction. We analyzed the relationship between the timing of treatment in
      the parasite growth cycle, and whether the parasitemia level rose or fell in the 
      first 12 or 24 hours after treatment. RESULTS: The timing of treatment in the
      parasite life cycle predicted whether subjects experienced rises or falls in
      parasitemia level after treatment. Antimalarials were unable to prevent rises in 
      the parasitemia level in the first 12 hours. However, in the first 24 hours after
      treatment, fast-acting but not slow-acting drugs reduced the parasitemia level
      independent of when treatment was administered. CONCLUSIONS: The highly variable 
      lag phase depends on the speed of action of an antimalarial and when in the
      periodic growth cycle it is administered.

TI  - Contribution of Polymerase Chain Reaction for detection of malaria in Tunisia.
PG  - 766-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Tunisia, detection of Plasmodium in asymptomatic individuals from 
      endemic countries is a critical measure in national program of malaria
      eradication. The screening is based on microscopic examination of thick and thin 
      blood smears. However, the performance of this diagnosis is closely related to
      the experience of biologist and the parasitaemia. AIM: The objective of this
      study was to evaluate the contribution of the PCR in the screening of malaria.
      METHODS: This prospective study involved 260 students from malaria endemic areas 
      who were screened for malaria between september 2011 and june 2013. Each subject 
      had a blood sample which was examined for malaria by microscopy and nested
      multiplex PCR. RESULTS: PCR detected the presence of Plasmodium in 13 blood
      samples (5%). While microscopy was positive only in nine cases (3.5%). The
      discordances involved five negative samples at microscopy and which were positive
      in PCR and a negative sample in PCR which was positive at microscopy. A mixed
      infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae was identified by
      PCR. For this case, microscopy diagnosed only Plasmodium falciparum specie.
      CONCLUSION: PCR is more efficient than microscopy in detecting low parasitaemia ;
      particularly observed in asymptomatic subjects. This technique allows to reduce
      asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium and reduce the risk of a resumption of
      transmission of malaria in our country.

TI  - Clinical illness and outcomes in Nigerian children with late-appearing anaemia
      after artemisinin-based combination treatments of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.1186/s12879-016-1565-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late-appearing anaemia (LAA) following treatment with artemisinins
      for severe malaria has been reported and well described, but there are limited
      clinical and parasitological data on LAA in African children with uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria following oral artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).
      METHODS: This was an open label study with the main objectives of evaluating the 
      clinical features, the risk factors for, the temporal changes in haematocrit and 
      the outcomes of a LAA in malarious children treated with artesunate-amodiaquine
      (AA), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP). The
      diagnosis of LAA was made using the criteria: clearance of parasitaemia, fever
      and other symptoms within 1 week of commencing treatment; adequate clinical and
      parasitological response at 4-6 weeks after treatment began; haematocrit >/=30 % 
      1 and/or 2 weeks after treatment began; and haematocrit <30 %, parasite
      negativity by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction and absence of concomitant
      illness 3-6 weeks after treatment began. RESULTS: LAA occurred in 84 of 609
      children, was mild, moderate or severe in 77, 6 or 1 child, respectively and was 
      relatively asymptomatic. Mean time elapsing from commencement of treatment to LAA
      was 27.1 days (95 % CI 25.3-28.9). In a multivariate analysis, an age <3 years
      (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] = 2.6, 95 % CI 1.3-5.2, P = 0.005), fever 1 day after
      treatment began (AOR = 3.8, 95 % CI 1.8-8.2, P < 0.0001), haematocrit <25 % at
      presentation (AOR = 2.2, 95 % CI 1.3-3.7, P = 0.003), haematocrit <30 % 1 day
      after treatment began (AOR = 2.1, 95 % CI 1.0-4.3, P = 0.04), parasite reduction 
      ratio >10(4) 2 days after treatment began (AOR = 2.1, 95 % CI 1.1-3.9, P = 0.03) 
      and spleen enlargement at presentation (AOR = 2.0, 95 % CI 1.1-3.9, P < 0.0001)
      were independent predictors of LAA. During 6 weeks of follow-up, uneventful
      recovery from anaemia occurred in 56 children [mean recovery time of 11.8 days
      (95 % CI 10.3-13.3)]. The only independent predictor of failure of recovery was
      LAA occurring 4 weeks after starting treatment (AOR = 7.5, 95 % CI 2.5-22.9, P < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSION: A relatively asymptomatic LAA with uneventful recovery can
      occur in young malarious children following ACTs. Its occurrence may have
      implications for case and community management of anaemia and for anaemia control
      efforts in sub-Saharan Africa where ACTs have become first-line antimalarials.

TI  - DETECTION OF PUTATIVE ANTIMALARIAL-RESISTANT PLASMODIUM VIVAX IN ANOPHELES
      VECTORS AT THAILAND-CAMBODIA AND THAILAND-MYANMAR BORDERS.
PG  - 182-93
AB  - Monitoring of multidrug-resistant (MDR)falciparum and vivax malaria has recently 
      been included in the Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment (GPARC)
      of the Greater Mekong Sub-region, particularly at the Thailand-Cambodia and
      Thailand-Myanmar borders. In parallel to GPARC, monitoring MDR malaria parasites 
      in anopheline vectors is an ideal augment to entomological surveillance.
      Employing Plasmodium- and species-specific nested PCR techniques, only P. vivax
      was detected in 3/109 salivary gland DNA extracts of anopheline vectors collected
      during a rainy season between 24-26 August 2009 and 22-24 September 2009 and a
      dry season between 29-31 December 2009 and 16-18 January 2010. Indoor and out-
      door resting mosquitoes were collected in Thong Pha Phum District, Kanchanaburi
      Province (border of Thailand-Myanmar) and Bo Rai District, Trat Province (border 
      of Thailand-Cambodia): one sample from Anopheles dirus at the Thailand-Cambodia
      border and two samples from An. aconitus from Thailand-Myanmar border isolate.
      Nucleotide sequencing of dihydrofolate reductase gene revealed the presence in
      all three samples of four mutations known to cause high resistance to antifolate 
      pyrimethamine, but no mutations were found in multidrug resistance transporter 1 
      gene that are associated with (falciparum) resistance to quinoline antimalarials.
      Such findings indicate the potential usefulness of this approach in monitoring
      the prevalence of drug-resistant malaria parasites in geographically regions
      prone to the development of drug resistance and where screening of human
      population at risk poses logistical and ethical problems. Keywords: Anopheles

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current malaria control strategies are based on early diagnosis and
      appropriate treatment of malaria cases. The study aimed at comparing the
      performance of blood film microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in
      Plasmodium falciparum detection in patients >/=6 years of age. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 154 consecutive pyretic patients aged 6-62 years were
      enrolled, sampled, and tested for malaria using RDT (first response) and
      microscopy by Giemsa staining. Genomic DNA was extracted after saponin hemolysis 
      and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Plasmodium
      falciparum. The endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
      value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Of the 154 patients,
      80 (51.9%) had fever of >/=37.5 degrees C. 106 (68.8%) were positive by First
      response(R) , 132 (85.7%) by microscopy, and 121 (78.6%) by PCR. The sensitivity,
      specificity, PPV, and NPV of first response compared to microscopic method were
      82.2%, 100.0%, 100.0%, and 34.3%, respectively, while it was 75.4%, 75.0%, 95.3%,
      and 31.2%, respectively, when compared to PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
      and NPV of the microscopic method compared to PCR were 92.3%, 50.0%, 90.91%, and 
      54.5%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the performance of RDT
      and film microscopy methods (P </= 0.05). CONCLUSION: Microscopy performed better
      and is more reliable than first response (RDT) in areas with low parasite density
      among patients >/=6 years of age. Rapid diagnostic tests could be useful in
      aareas with high parasite density as an alternative to smear microscopy.

AB  - Malaria is a disease caused by a protozoan of the Plasmodium genus and results in
      0.5-0.7million deaths per year. Increasing drug resistance of the parasite and
      insecticide resistance of mosquitoes necessitate alternative control measures.
      Numerous vaccine candidates have been identified but none have been able to
      induce robust, long-lived protection when evaluated in malaria endemic regions.
      Rodent studies have demonstrated that chemically attenuated blood stage parasites
      can persist at sub-patent levels and induce homologous and heterologous
      protection against malaria. Parasite-specific cellular responses were detected,
      with protection dependent on CD4+ T cells. To investigate this vaccine approach
      for Plasmodium falciparum, we characterised the persistence and immunogenicity of
      chemically attenuated P. falciparum FVO strain parasites (CAPs) in
      non-splenectomised Aotus nancymaae monkeys following administration of a single
      dose. Control monkeys received either normal red blood cells or wild-type
      parasites followed by drug treatment. Chemical attenuation was performed using
      tafuramycin A, which irreversibly binds to DNA. CAPs were detected in the
      peripheral blood for up to 2days following inoculation as determined by thick
      blood smears, and for up to 8days as determined by quantitative PCR.
      Parasite-specific IgG was not detected in monkeys that received CAPs; however, in
      vitro parasite-specific T cell proliferation was observed. Following challenge,
      the CAP monkeys developed an infection; however, one CAP monkey and the infection
      and drug-cure monkeys showed partial or complete resistance. These experiments
      lay the groundwork for further assessment of CAPs as a potential vaccine against 
      malaria.

TI  - Sustained efficacy of artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine against Plasmodium
      falciparum in Yemen and a renewed call for an adjunct single dose primaquine to
      clear gametocytes.
PG  - 295
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1344-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Yemen, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) has
      been used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria, which
      accounts for about 99 % of malaria cases. There is evidence that resistance to SP
      is increasing, with potential negative impact on efficacy, and in particular on
      curbing transmission. This study aims: (a) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
      of AS + SP treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Yemen; (b) to
      investigate the frequency of mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes associated 
      with resistance to AS (Kelch 13 propeller domain, pfK13) and SP (dihydrofolate
      reductase, pfdhfr, and dihydropteroate synthase, pfdhps); and (c) to assess the
      adequacy of this ACT to clear gametocytes. METHODS: A 28-day in vivo evaluation
      of the clinical and parasitological response to three-day course of AS + SP was
      carried out in two areas of high endemicity (Hodeidah and Al-Mahwit provinces,
      Tehama region) in Yemen according to standard WHO protocol 2009. Clinical and
      parasitological indices were monitored over a 28-day follow-up, and the outcome
      was PCR-corrected. The frequencies of mutations in the pfdhfr, pfdhps, and pfK13 
      genes were obtained by sequencing following amplification. RESULTS: Eighty-six
      patients completed the study, with a cure rate of 96.5 % (94.2 %
      PCR-uncorrected). Whereas four (4.7 %) patients still showed parasitaemia on day 
      2 post-treatment, all were found negative for asexual malaria stages on days 3
      and 7. The efficacy of gametocyte clearance was poor (14.5, 42.5 and 86.0 % on
      days 7, 14 and 28, respectively), with gametocytes persisting throughout the
      study in some patients. All the isolates sequenced had the pfk13 propeller domain
      wild-type allele, and mutations associated with SP failure were observed only for
      pfdhfr with the double mutation (S108N + N51I) found in 65.4 % of the isolates
      sequenced. CONCLUSION: In Yemen, AS + SP therapy remains effective for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Mutations were not detected in
      pfk13 or pfdhps, though double mutations were observed for pfdhfr. The observed
      persistent gametocytaemia re-enforces calls to add a single dose primaquine to
      this ACT in order to minimizes the potential for transmission and enhance
      regional efforts to eliminate malaria.

TI  - Asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in 18 villages of southern Savannakhet
      Province, Lao PDR (Laos).
PG  - 296
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1336-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large fraction of Plasmodium infections do not cause clinical signs
      and symptoms of disease and persist at densities in blood that are not detectable
      by microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. These infections may be critical as a
      transmission reservoir in areas of low malaria endemicity. Understanding the
      epidemiology of these infections would be helpful for malaria elimination.
      METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Thapangthong and Nong
      Districts of Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, to determine the prevalence of
      parasitaemia. A total of 888 blood samples were collected from afebrile
      volunteers aged >/=15 years in 18 villages during March and July 2015. Plasmodium
      infections were diagnosed by rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and high volume,
      ultra-sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (uPCR). RESULTS: uPCR
      detected Plasmodium infections in 175 of 888 samples (20 %). The species
      distribution was Plasmodium falciparum 3.6 % (32/888), Plasmodium vivax 11.1 %
      (99/888), mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax 1.6 % (14/888) and
      Plasmodium of undetermined species 3.4 % (30/888). RDT identified only 2 %
      (18/888) positive cases. Using uPCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity
      of RDTs were 28 and 100 %, respectively, in detecting P. falciparum infections,
      and 3 and 99 % in detecting asymptomatic P. vivax infections. The K13 kelch
      propeller domain C580Y mutation, associated with reduced susceptibility to
      artemisinin derivatives, was found in 75 % (12/18) of P. falciparum isolates from
      Thapangthong and in 7 % (2/28) from Nong (p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis,
      males were more likely to have P. vivax infections [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)
      4.76 (95 % CI 2.84-8.00)] while older villagers were at lower risk for
      parasitaemia [aOR for increasing age 0.98 (95 % CI 0.96-0.99)]. CONCLUSION: There
      is a high prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in southern
      Savannakhet. Artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum strains form an increasing
      proportion of the parasite population in Thapangthong District and are already
      present in the more remote Nong District. This worrying trend has wider
      implications for Laos and could reverse the gains achieved by the successful
      control of malaria in Laos and the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS). Rapid
      elimination of P. falciparum has to be a top priority in Laos as well as in the
      wider GMS.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0153899 [doi]
AB  - Control strategies implemented a decade ago led to a marked reduction in the
      prevalence of malaria in many countries. In Dienga, southeastern Gabon, the
      prevalence of microscopic P. falciparum infection was 7% in 2003, close to the
      pre-elimination threshold of 5%. The aim of this work was to determine the
      prevalence of P. falciparum infection in the same community a decade later. A
      cohort of 370 individuals aged from 3 to 85 years living in Dienga was
      investigated for P. falciparum infection; during six passages (P) in 15-month
      period. Demographic data were collected, along with behaviors and attitudes
      towards malaria. Plasmodium infection was diagnosed by microscopy (ME), followed 
      by PCR to detect submicroscopic infection. The prevalence of P. falciparum
      infection in P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6 was respectively 43.5% (25.1% ME+, 18.4%

      ME+, 20% PCR+), 57.7% (25.4.% ME+, 32.3% PCR+); and 46.2% (21.4% ME+, 24.8% PCR+)
      with an overall average of 45.9% (95%CI [37.0-54.7], 23.2% ME+ and 22.7% PCR+).
      P4 and P5 prevalences were statically different throughout the six passages.
      Microscopic prevalence was significantly higher than that observed ten years ago 
      (23% [n = 370] vs 7% [n = 323], p < 0.001). Asymptomatic infections were the most
      frequent (96%). Gametocytes were detected in levels ranging from 5.9% to 13.9%.
      Insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual insecticides, and self-medication were 
      used by respectively 33.2% (95%CI [29.0-37.4]), 17.7% (95%CI [15.5-19.9]) and
      12.1% (95%CI [10.6-13.6]) of the study population. A near-threefold increase in
      P. falciparum infection has been observed in a rural area of southeastern Gabon
      during a 10-year period. Most infections were asymptomatic, but these subjects
      likely represent a parasite reservoir. These findings call for urgent
      reinforcement of preventive measures.

TI  - Sequence analysis of pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes and its association with chloroquine 
      resistance in Southeast Indian Plasmodium falciparum isolates.
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.1016/j.gdata.2016.04.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the widespread resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to
      chloroquine drug, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been
      recommended as the first-line treatment. This study aims to evaluate the extent
      of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum infection after the introduction of
      ACT. This study was carried out based on the mutation analysis in P. falciparum
      chloroquine resistant transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 
      1 (pfmdr1) genes. Identification of these molecular markers plays a significant
      role in monitoring and assessment of drug resistance as well as in designing an
      effective antimalarial drug policy in India. METHODS: Sixty blood samples were
      collected from patients infected with P. falciparum from JIPMER, Puducherry and
      MKCG Medical College, Odisha. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism was performed, targeting the point mutation of K76T in pfcrt 
      and N86Y in pfmdr1 gene. The PCR products were sequenced, genotyped and further
      analysed for amino acid changes in these codons. RESULTS: The frequency of pfcrt 
      mutation at 76th position was dominant for mutant T allele with 56.7% and wild
      type K, 43.3%. Majority of pfmdr1 86 allele were wild type, with N (90%) and
      mutant, Y (10%). Additionally, we found three haplotypes for CQ resistance,
      SVMNT, CVIET and CVIKT in association with the pfcrt gene. However, a poorly
      studied SNP in pfmdr1 gene (Y184F) associated with CQ resistance showed high
      frequency (70%) in P. falciparum isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The point mutation K76T
      of pfcrt is high in P. falciparum suggesting a sustained high CQ resistance even 
      after five years of the introduction of ACTs for antimalarial therapy. The
      present study suggests a strong association of CQ resistance with pfcrt T76, but 
      not with the pfmdr1 Y86 mutation. However, sequence analysis showed that Y184F
      mutation on pfmdr1 gene was found to be associated with high resistance. Also, a 
      new pfcrt haplotype 'CVIKT' associated with CQ resistance was found to be present
      in Indian strains of P. falciparum. The data obtained from this study helps in
      continuous monitoring of drug resistance in malaria and also suggests the need
      for careful usage of CQ in Plasmodium vivax malarial treatment.

TI  - A significant association between deltamethrin resistance, Plasmodium falciparum 
      infection and the Vgsc-1014S resistance mutation in Anopheles gambiae highlights 
      the epidemiological importance of resistance markers.
PG  - 289
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1331-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of malaria vector control is threatened by widespread
      pyrethroid insecticide resistance. However, the extent to which insecticide
      resistance impacts transmission is unclear. The objective of this study was to
      examine the association between the DDT/pyrethroid knockdown resistance mutation 
      Vgsc-1014S, commonly termed kdr, and infection with Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoites in Anopheles gambiae. METHODS: WHO standard methods were used to
      characterize susceptibility of wild female mosquitoes to 0.05 % deltamethrin.
      PCR-based molecular diagnostics were used to identify mosquitoes to species and
      to genotype at the Vgsc-L1014S locus. ELISAs were used to detect the presence of 
      P. falciparum sporozoites and for blood meal identification. RESULTS: Anopheles
      mosquitoes were resistant to deltamethrin with mortality rates of 77.7 % [95 % CI
      74.9-80.3 %]. Of 545 mosquitoes genotyped 96.5 % were A. gambiae s.s. and 3.5 %
      were Anopheles arabiensis. The Vgsc-1014S mutation was detected in both species. 
      Both species were predominantly anthropophagic. In A. gambiae s.s., Vgsc-L1014S
      genotype was significantly associated with deltamethrin resistance (chi2 = 11.2; 
      p < 0.001). The P. falciparum sporozoite infection rate was 4.2 %. There was a
      significant association between the presence of sporozoites and Vgsc-L1014S
      genotype in A. gambiae s.s. (chi2 = 4.94; p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: One marker,
      Vgsc-1014S, was associated with insecticide resistance and P. falciparum
      infection in wild-caught mixed aged populations of A. gambiae s.s. thereby
      showing how resistance may directly impact transmission.

AB  - Safe and effective antimalarial drugs are required for the treatment of pregnant 
      women. We report a 3-day regimen of artesunate (4 mg/kg/day)-azithromycin (25
      mg/kg/day) (ASAZ) to be efficacious (polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure
      rate of 96.7%) and well tolerated in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in children (N = 11) and adults (N = 19), in Vietnam in 2010. In
      comparison, the cure rate for artesunate (4 mg/kg on day 0, 2 mg/kg on days 1-6) 
      was 90.0% in children (N = 7) and adults (N = 23). Because azithromycin is
      considered safe in pregnancy, our findings provide further evidence that ASAZ
      should be evaluated for the treatment of pregnant women with malaria.

TI  - High efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and declining efficacy of artesunate +
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine against Plasmodium falciparum in Sudan (2010-2015):
      evidence from in vivo and molecular marker studies.
PG  - 285
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1339-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present paper reports on studies that evaluated artesunate +
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) which is the first-line drug and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) which is a second-line drug against uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in Sudan. This evaluation was performed in twenty studies
      covering six sentinel sites during five successive annual malaria transmission
      seasons from 2010 to 2015. METHODS: The standard World Health Organization
      protocol was used for a follow-up period of 28 days. The frequency distribution
      of molecular markers for antifolate resistance in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) 
      and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes was studied in pre-treatment samples in
      four sites in 2011. RESULTS: In the nine studies of AL conducted at five sites (n
      = 595), high PCR-corrected cure rates were found, ranging from 96.8 to 100 %.
      Among the eleven studies of AS + SP (n = 1013), a decline in the PCR-corrected
      cure rates was observed in Gedaref in Eastern Sudan: 91.0 % in the 2011-12 season
      and 86.5 % in the 2014-15 season. In the remaining sites, the AS + SP cure rates 
      ranged between 95.6 and 100 %. The rate of clearance of microscopic
      gametocytaemia after treatment was not significantly different with AL or AS + SP
      on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of follow-up. A total of 371 pre-treatment samples were 
      analysed for molecular markers of SP resistance. The temporal changes and
      geographical differences in the frequency distribution of SP-resistance genotypes
      showed evidence of regional differentiation and selection of resistant strains.
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this study call for a need to review the Sudan
      malaria treatment policy. Epidemiological factors could play a major role in the 
      emergence of drug-resistant malaria in eastern Sudan. AUSTRALIAN NEW ZEALAND

TI  - Persistence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia after artemisinin combination
      therapy: evidence from a randomized trial in Uganda.
PG  - 26330
LID - 10.1038/srep26330 [doi]
AB  - Artemisinin resistance is rapidly spreading in Southeast Asia. The efficacy of
      artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) continues to be excellent across Africa. We
      performed parasite transcriptional profiling and genotyping on samples from an
      antimalarial treatment trial in Uganda. We used qRT-PCR and genotyping to
      characterize residual circulating parasite populations after treatment with
      either ACT or ACT-primaquine. Transcripts suggestive of circulating ring stage
      parasites were present after treatment at a prevalence of >25% until at least 14 
      days post initiation of treatment. Greater than 98% of all ring stage parasites
      were cleared within the first 3 days, but subsequently persisted at low
      concentrations until day 14 after treatment. Genotyping demonstrated a
      significant decrease in multiplicity of infection within the first 2 days in both
      ACT and ACT-primaquine arms. However, multiple clone infections persisted until
      day 14 post treatment. Our data suggest the presence of genetically diverse
      persisting parasite populations after ACT treatment. Although we did not
      demonstrate clinical treatment failures after ACT and the viability and
      transmissibility of persisting ring stage parasites remain to be shown, these
      findings are of relevance for the interpretation of parasite clearance
      transmission dynamics and for monitoring drug effects in Plasmodium falciparum
      parasites.

TI  - Increased Prevalence of Mutant Allele Pfdhps 437G and Pfdhfr Triple Mutation in
      Plasmodium falciparum Isolates from a Rural Area of Gabon, Three Years after the 
      Change of Malaria Treatment Policy.
PG  - 9694372
LID - 10.1155/2016/9694372 [doi]
AB  - In Gabon, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for intermittent
      preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) and for uncomplicated malaria
      treatment through ACTs drug. P. falciparum strains resistant to SP are frequent
      in areas where this drug is highly used and is associated with the occurrence of 
      mutations on Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and
      dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) genes. The aim of the study was to compare
      the proportion of mutations on Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes in isolates collected at
      Oyem in northern Gabon, in 2005 at the time of IPTp-SP introduction and three
      years later. Point mutations were analyzed by nested PCR-RFLP method. Among 91
      isolates, more than 90% carried Pfdhfr 108N and Pfdhfr 59R alleles. Frequencies
      of Pfdhfr 51I (98%) and Pfdhps 437G (67.7%) mutant alleles were higher in 2008.
      Mutations at codons 164, 540, and 581 were not detected. The proportion of the
      triple Pfdhfr mutation and quadruple mutation including A437G was high: 91.9% in 
      2008 and 64.8% in 2008, respectively. The present study highlights an elevated
      frequency of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutant alleles, although quintuple mutations were 
      not found in north Gabon. These data suggest the need of a continuous monitoring 
      of SP resistance in Gabon.

TI  - Malaria prevalence, severity and treatment outcome in relation to day 7
      lumefantrine plasma concentration in pregnant women.
PG  - 278
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1327-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Day 7 plasma concentrations of lumefantrine (LF) can serve as a
      marker to predict malaria treatment outcome in different study populations. Two
      main cut-off points (175 and 280 ng/ml) are used to indicate plasma
      concentrations of LF, below which treatment failure is anticipated. However,
      there is limited data on the cumulative risk of recurrent parasitaemia (RP) in
      relation to day 7 LF plasma concentrations in pregnant women. This study
      describes the prevalence, severity, factors influencing treatment outcome of
      malaria in pregnancy and day 7 LF plasma concentration therapeutic cut-off points
      that predicts treatment outcome in pregnant women. METHODS: This was a one-arm
      prospective cohort study whereby 89 pregnant women with uncomplicated Plasmodium 
      falciparum malaria receiving artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) participated in
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study. Blood samples were collected on days
      0, 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for malaria parasite quantification. LF plasma
      concentrations were determined on day 7. The primary outcome measure was an
      adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) after treatment with ALu.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria in pregnant women was 8.1 % (95 % CI
      6.85-9.35) of whom 3.4 % (95 % CI 1.49-8.51) had severe malaria. The overall
      PCR-uncorrected treatment failure rate was 11.7 % (95 % CI 0.54-13.46 %). Low
      baseline hemoglobin (<10 g/dl) and day 7 LF concentration <600 ng/ml were
      significant predictors of RP. The median day 7 LF concentration was significantly
      lower in pregnant women with RP (270 ng/ml) than those with ACPR (705 ng/ml) (p =
      0.016). The relative risk of RP was 4.8 folds higher (p = 0.034) when cut-off of 
      <280 ng/ml was compared to >/=280 ng/ml and 7.8-folds higher (p = 0.022) when
      cut-off of <600 ng/ml was compared to >/=600 ng/ml. The cut-off value of 175
      ng/ml was not associated with the risk of RP (p = 0.399). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant
      women with day 7 LF concentration <600 ng/ml are at high risk of RP than those
      with >/=600 ng/ml. To achieve effective therapeutic outcome, higher day 7 venous 
      plasma LF concentration >/=600 ng/ml is required for pregnant patients than the
      previously suggested cut-off value of 175 or 280 ng/ml for non-pregnant adult
      patients.

TI  - Microsatellite genotyping and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism-based
      indices of Plasmodium falciparum diversity within clinical infections.
PG  - 275
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1324-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In regions where malaria is endemic, individuals are often infected
      with multiple distinct parasite genotypes, a situation that may impact on
      evolution of parasite virulence and drug resistance. Most approaches to studying 
      genotypic diversity have involved analysis of a modest number of polymorphic
      loci, although whole genome sequencing enables a broader characterisation of
      samples. METHODS: PCR-based microsatellite typing of a panel of ten loci was
      performed on Plasmodium falciparum in 95 clinical isolates from a highly endemic 
      area in the Republic of Guinea, to characterize within-isolate genetic diversity.
      Separately, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from genome-wide short-read
      sequences of the same samples were used to derive within-isolate fixation indices
      (F ws), an inverse measure of diversity within each isolate compared to overall
      local genetic diversity. The latter indices were compared with the microsatellite
      results, and also with indices derived by randomly sampling modest numbers of
      SNPs. RESULTS: As expected, the number of microsatellite loci with more than one 
      allele in each isolate was highly significantly inversely correlated with the
      genome-wide F ws fixation index (r = -0.88, P < 0.001). However, the
      microsatellite analysis revealed that most isolates contained mixed genotypes,
      even those that had no detectable genome sequence heterogeneity. Random sampling 
      of different numbers of SNPs showed that an F ws index derived from ten or more
      SNPs with minor allele frequencies of >10 % had high correlation (r > 0.90) with 
      the index derived using all SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of data give
      highly correlated indices of within-infection diversity, although PCR-based
      analysis detects low-level minority genotypes not apparent in bulk sequence
      analysis. When whole-genome data are not obtainable, quantitative assay of ten or
      more SNPs can yield a reasonably accurate estimate of the within-infection
      fixation index (F ws).

TI  - [Detection of Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis in cyst
      samples using a novel single tube multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction].
PG  - 266-77
AB  - Cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by
      Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively, are
      important helminthic diseases worldwide as well as in our country.
      Epidemiological studies conducted in Turkey showed that the prevalence of CE is
      291-585/100.000. It has also been showed that the seroprevalence of AE is 3.5%.
      For the diagnosis of CE and AE, radiological (ultrasonography, computed
      tomography, magnetic resonance) and serological methods, in addition to clinical 
      findings, are being used. The definitive diagnosis relies on pathological
      examination When the hydatid cysts are sterile or does not contain protoscolex,
      problems may occur during pathological discrimination of E.granulosus and
      E.multilocularis species. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel multiplex
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (M-RT-PCR) targeting mitochondrial 12S rRNA
      gene of E.granulosus and E.multilocularis using Echi S
      (5'-TTTATGAATATTGTGACCCTGAGAT-3') and Echi A (5'-GGTCTTAACTCAACTCATGGAG-3')
      primers and three different probes; Anchor Ech
      (5'-GTTTGCCACCTCGATGTTGACTTAG-fluoroscein-3'), Granulosus
      (5'-LC640-CTAAGGTTTTGGTGTAGTAATTGATATTTT-phosphate-3') and Multilocularis
      (5'-LC705-CTGTGATCTTGGTGTAGTAGTTGAGATT-phosphate-3') that will enable the
      diagnosis of CE and AE in same assay. During M-RTR-PCR, plasmids containing
      E.granulosus (GenBank: AF297617.1) and E.multilocularis (GenBank: NC_000928.2)
      mitochondrial 12S rRNA regions were used as positive controls. Cysts samples of
      patients which were pathologically confirmed to be CE (n: 10) and AE (n: 15) and 
      healthy human DNA samples (n: 25) as negative control as well as DNA samples of
      12 different parasites (Taenia saginata, Hymenolepis nana, Trichuris trichiura,
      Fasciola hepatica, Enterobius vermicularis, Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis
      jirovecii, Trichomonas vaginalis, Cryptosporidium hominis, Strongyloides
      stercoralis, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax) were used to develop
      M-RT-PCR. E.granulosus and E.multilocularis control plasmids were constructed to 
      detect analytic sensitivity of the test using TOPO cloning. Positive control
      plasmids were diluted to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity by
      distilled water at 10(6)-10(5)-10(4)-10(3)-10(2)-10(1)-1 plasmid copy of dilution
      in each reaction. According to the results, analytical sensitivity of the assay
      for E.granulosus and E.multilocularis was 1 copy plasmid/microl reaction. The
      non-existence of cross reactivity with 12 different parasites' DNA samples showed
      the analytical specificity of the assay. Displaying Echinococcus DNA in cyst
      samples among 25 patients and species discrimination as well as non-existence of 
      cross reactivity with human DNA samples showed that the clinical sensitivity and 
      specificity of the assay were 100%. As a result, the M-RT-PCR developed in the
      present study provided a sensitive, specific, rapid, and reliable method in the
      diagnosis of echinococcosis and the discrimination of E.granulosus and
      E.multilocularis from cyst samples.

      Illness in Kenya.
PG  - e0155308
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0155308 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most acute febrile illnesses (AFI) are usually not associated with a 
      specific diagnosis because of limitations of available diagnostics. This study
      reports on the frequency of EBV viremia and viral load in children and adults
      presenting with febrile illness in hospitals in Kenya. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: A pathogen surveillance study was conducted on patients presenting with
      AFI (N = 796) at outpatient departments in 8 hospitals located in diverse regions
      of Kenya. Enrollment criterion to the study was fever without a readily
      diagnosable infection. All the patients had AFI not attributable to the common
      causes of fever in Kenyan hospitals, such as malaria or rickettsiae, leptospira, 
      brucella and salmonella and they were hence categorized as having AFI of unknown 
      etiology. EBV was detected in blood using quantitative TaqMan-based qPCR
      targeting a highly conserved BALF5 gene. The overall frequency of EBV viremia in 
      this population was 29.2%, with significantly higher proportion in younger
      children of <5years (33.8%, p = 0.039) compared to patients aged >/=5 years
      (26.3% for 5-15 years or 18.8% for >15 years). With respect to geographical
      localities, the frequency of EBV viremia was higher in the Lake Victoria region
      (36.4%), compared to Kisii highland (24.6%), Coastal region (22.2%) and Semi-Arid
      region (25%). Furthermore, patients from the malaria endemic coastal region and
      the Lake Victoria region presented with significantly higher viremia than
      individuals from other regions of Kenya. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study
      provides profiles of EBV in patients with AFI from diverse eco-regions of Kenya. 
      Of significant interest is the high frequency of EBV viremia in younger children.
      The observed high frequencies of EBV viremia and elevated viral loads in
      residents of high malaria transmission areas are probably related to malaria
      induced immune activation and resultant expansion of EBV infected B-cells.

TI  - Molecular mutation profile of pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum isolates imported
      from Africa in Henan province.
PG  - 265
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1306-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance is a primary public health problem.
      Haplotypes of pfcrt gene have been implicated to be molecular markers of
      chloroquine (CQ) resistance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of
      polymorphisms in pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum-infected patients imported from
      Africa in Henan province. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 502 patients
      who were infected with P. falciparum returning from Africa in Henan province
      during 2012-2015. The single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfcrt (codons 72-76)
      were assessed by nested PCR with DNA sequencing and restriction digestion, the
      haplotype prevalences were also determined. RESULTS: Four haplotypes coding 72-76
      of pfcrt were found including CVMNK (wild type), CVIET (mutation type), CVIEK
      (mutation type), and CV M/I N/E/D/K K/T (mixed type), with 61.95 % (311/502),
      33.07 % (166/502), 0.20 % (1/502), and 4.78 % (24/502) prevalence, respectively. 
      Except mixed type, CVIET and CVIEK were the largest proportion of the mutant type
      in West Africa, accounting for 44.83 % (91/203), followed by East Africa (8/21,
      38.10 %), North Africa (4/11, 36.36 %), Central Africa (36/135, 26.67 %), and
      South Africa (28/132, 21.21 %). There was significant difference among the groups
      (chi(2) = 23.78, P < 0.05). Mixed type was the largest proportion in North Africa
      (9.09 %), followed by Central Africa (6.67 %), East Africa (4.76 %), South Africa
      (4.55 %), and West Africa (3.45 %). There was no significant difference among the
      groups (chi(2) = 2.31, P > 0.05). The position 72 and 73 of pfcrt showed
      predominance for the wild type with rates of 100 % (502/502). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study identified four haplotypes of pfcrt in P. falciparum-infected patients
      imported from Africa in Henan province. The prevalence of mutations in the pfcrt 
      was dropped comparing with other people's researches. It establishes fundamental 
      data for detection of P. falciparum CQR with molecular markers for the imported
      P. falciparum in China, and it also provides complementary information of CQR for
      the malaria endemic countries and assesses the evolution of anti-malarial drug
      resistance.

TI  - Circumsporozoite protein rates, blood-feeding pattern and frequency of knockdown 
      resistance mutations in Anopheles spp. in two ecological zones of Mauritania.
PG  - 268
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1543-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles gambiae species complex are the
      main malaria vector in Mauritania but data on their vector capacities, feeding
      habits and insecticide susceptibility are still scanty. The objectives of this
      study were to fill this gap. METHODS: Adult Anopheles spp. mosquitoes were
      collected using pyrethrum spray catch method from two ecological zones of
      Mauritania: Nouakchott (Saharan zone) and Hodh Elgharbi region (Sahelian zone).
      Circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) for P. falciparum, P. vivax VK210 and P. vivax
      VK247 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the female 
      anopheline mosquitoes. To confirm CSP-ELISA results, polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) was also performed. Blood meal identification was performed in all engorged
      females by partial sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Molecular
      assessments of pyrethroid knockdown resistance (kdr) and insensitive
      acetylcholinesterase resistance (ace-1) were conducted. RESULTS: In Nouakchott,
      the only species of Anopheles identified during the survey was Anopheles
      arabiensis (356 specimens). In Hodh Elgharbi, 1016 specimens of Anopheles were
      collected, including 578 (56.9%) Anopheles rufipes, 410 (40.35%) An. arabiensis, 
      20 (1.96%) An. gambiae, 5 (0.5%) An. pharoensis and 3 (0.3 %) An. funestus. Three
      of 186 female An. arabiensis collected in Nouakchott and tested by ELISA were
      found positive for Plasmodium vivax VK210, corresponding to a sporozoite rate of 
      1.6%; however PCR confirmed infection by P. vivax sporozoite in only one of
      these. In Hodh Elgharbi, no mosquito was found positive for Plasmodium spp.
      infection. There was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of 
      human blood-fed Anopheles spp. between Nouakchott (58.7%, 47 of 80 blood-engorged
      An. arabiensis females) and Hodh Elgharbi (11.1%, 2 of 18 blood-engorged
      mosquitoes). Analysis of the kdr polymorphisms showed 48.2% (70/145) of East
      African kdr mutation (L1014S) in Nouakchott compared to 10% (4/40) in Hodh
      Elgharbi region (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, West African kdr mutation (L1014F) was
      found only in An. gambiae populations (4/40, 10%) from Hodh Elgharbi region. No
      ace-1 mutation was found in mosquito specimens from the two study zones.
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study confirmed the autochthonous P. vivax malaria
      transmission in Nouakchott, involving An. arabiensis as the main vector. It also 
      described for the first time the absence of ace-1 mutation, the co-occurrence of 
      both West and East African kdr mutation in An. gambiae in Mauritania, and
      highlighted the regional variations in the prevalence and type of kdr mutations.

AB  - Though demonstration of Plasmodium parasite in peripheral blood on microscopy
      remains gold standard, it may miss some patients resulting in delay in
      instituting life-saving therapy. Studies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a
      highly sensitive and specific technique that also discriminates among different
      species of malaria parasite, are scanty. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the role of 
      PCR in diagnosis and species identification of Plasmodium. Of 2186 febrile
      patients with clinical suspicion of malaria screened between July 2013 to
      February 2015, 561 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Microscopy, rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT) and PCR were performed to identify the parasite. Plasmodium
      was detected in 64/561 (11.40 %), 92/561 (16.40 %) and 78/561 (13.90 %) cases
      using microscopy, RDT and PCR, respectively. Of 78 positive cases by PCR, 47
      (60.25 %) were confirmed as Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), 28 (35.89 %)
      were Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and 3 (3.84 %) had mixed infections. Sensitivity
      and specificity of microscopy and RDT were 82.10 %, 100 % and 98.70 %, 96.90 %,
      respectively (p = 0.139). Of total 93 patients, 67 (72.04 %) were classified as
      complicated and 26 (27.96 %) were as uncomplicated. Creatinine (p = <0.001),
      conjugated bilirubin (p = 0.003) and total bilirubin (p = <0.001) level was
      elevated in complicated malaria along with renal (65 %) and liver dysfunction (25
      %). In the present study, P. falciparum was responsible for 40/67 (59.70 %) cases
      of complicated malaria; P. vivax was also found in 17/67 (25.37 %) complicated
      cases using PCR. The findings highlight the alarming number of complicated vivax 
      malaria in addition to falciparum. Moreover, PCR proved to be highly sensitive
      and specific test for detecting Plasmodium species.

AB  - Plasmodiums are protozoa that may infect various hosts. Only five species are now
      recognized as naturally parasitizing humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
      vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi. This fifth 
      species, P. knowlesi, previously identified as naturally parasitizing the monkey 
      Macaca fascicularis, has been microscopically confused for a long time with P.
      malariae or P. falciparum and it was not possible to correctly differentiate them
      until the advent of molecular biology. To date, natural human infections with P. 
      knowlesi only occur in Southeast Asia and a similar phenomenon of natural
      transmission of simian plasmodium to humans has not been reported elsewhere. This
      study was conducted to investigate a possible transmission of African small
      monkey's plasmodium to humans in populations living near the rainforest of the
      Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where several species of non-human primates
      are living. Two successive real-time PCRs were identified in the literature and
      used in combination for purpose. Only P. falciparum was found in this study.
      However, studies with larger samples and with more advanced techniques should be 
      conducted.

AB  - For the effective control of malaria, development of sensitive, accurate and
      rapid tool to diagnose and manage the disease is essential. In humans subjects,
      the severe form of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium
      vivax (Pv) and there is need to identify these parasites in acute, chronic and
      latent (during and post-infection) stages of the disease. In this study, we
      report a species specific and sensitive diagnostic method for the detection of Pf
      and Pv in humans. First, we identified intra and intergenic multiloci short
      stretch of 152 (PfMLS152) and 110 (PvMLS110) nucleotides which is present up to
      44 and 34 times in the genomes of Pf and Pv respectively. We developed the
      single-step amplification-based method using isolated DNA or from lysed red blood
      cells for the detection of the two malaria parasites. The limit of detection of
      real-time polymerase chain reaction based assays were 0.1copyof parasite/mul for 
      PfMLS152 and PvMLS110 target sequences. Next, we have tested 250 clinically
      suspected cases of malaria to validate the method. Sensitivity and specificity
      for both targets were 100% compared to the quantitative buffy coat microscopy
      analysis and real-time PCR (Pf-chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) and
      Pv-lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH)) based assays. The sensitivity of microscopy and
      real-time PCR (PfCRT and PvLDH primers) assays were 80.63%; 95%CI 75.22%-85.31%; 
      p<0.05 and 97.61%; 95%CI 94.50%-99.21%; p<0.05 in detecting malaria infection
      respectively when compared to PfMLS152 and PvMLS110 targets to identify malaria
      infection in patients. These improved assays may have potential applications in
      evaluating malaria in asymptomatic patients, treatment, blood donors and in
      vaccine studies.

TI  - Therapeutic Efficacy of Artemether-Lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) in Treating
      Uncomplicated P. falciparum Malaria in Metehara, Eastern Ethiopia: Regulatory
      Clinical Study.
PG  - e0154618
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0154618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As per the WHO recommendation, the development of resistance by P.
      falciparum to most artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) triggered the need
      for routine monitoring of the efficacy of the drugs every two years in all
      malaria endemic countries. Hence, this study was carried out to assess the
      therapeutic efficacy of Artemether-Lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) in treating the
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria, after 9 years of its introduction in the
      Metehara, Eastern Ethiopia. METHOD: This is part of the therapeutic efficacy
      studies by the Federal Ministry of Health Ethiopia, which were conducted in
      regionally representative sentinel sites in the country from October 2014 to
      January 2015. Based on the study criteria set by WHO, febrile and malaria
      suspected outpatients in the health center were consecutively recruited to study.
      A standard six-dose regimen of AL was administered over three days and followed
      up for measuring therapeutic responses over 28 days. Data entry and analysis was 
      done by using the WHO designed Excel spreadsheet and SPSS version 20 for Windows.
      Statistical significant was considered for P-value less than 0.05. RESULT: Of the
      91 patients enrolled, the day-28 analysis showed 83 adequate clinical and
      parasitological responses (ACPRs). Per protocol analysis, PCR-uncorrected &
      corrected cure rates of Coartem(R) among the study participants were 97.6%
      (95%CI: 93.6-99.5) and 98.8% (CI: 93.5-100%), respectively. No parasite detected 
      on day 3 and onwards. Fever clearance was above 91% on day-3. Mean hemoglobin was
      significantly increased (P<0.000) from 12.39 g/dl at day 0 to 13.45 g/dl on day
      28. No serious adverse drug reactions were observed among the study participants.
      CONCLUSION: This study showed high efficacy of AL in the study area, which
      suggests the continuation of AL as first line drug for the treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the study area. This study recommends
      further studies on drug toxicity, particularly on repeated cough and oral
      ulceration.

TI  - Heterogeneous malaria transmission in long-term Afghan refugee populations: a
      cross-sectional study in five refugee camps in northern Pakistan.
PG  - 245
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1305-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Afghan refugees in northern Pakistan have been resident for over 30
      years and current information on malaria in this population is sparse.
      Understanding malaria risk and distribution in refugee camps is important for
      effective management both in camps and on return to Afghanistan. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional malariometric surveys were conducted in five Afghan refugee camps
      to determine infection and exposure to both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium 
      vivax. Factors associated with malaria infection and exposure were analysed using
      logistic regression, and spatial heterogeneity within camps was investigated with
      SatScan. RESULTS: In this low-transmission setting, prevalence of infection in
      the five camps ranged from 0-0.2 to 0.4-9 % by rapid diagnostic test and 0-1.39
      and 5-15 % by polymerase chain reaction for P. falciparum and P. vivax,
      respectively. Prevalence of anti-malarial antibodies to P. falciparum antigens
      was 3-11 and 17-45 % for P. vivax antigens. Significant foci of P. vivax
      infection and exposure were detected in three of the five camps. Hotspots of P.
      falciparum were also detected in three camps, only one of which also showed
      evidence of P. vivax hotspots. CONCLUSIONS: There is low and spatially
      heterogeneous malaria transmission in the refugee camps in northern Pakistan.
      Understanding malaria risk in refugee camps is important so the malaria risk
      faced by these populations in the camps and upon their return to Afghanistan can 
      be effectively managed.

TI  - History of malaria treatment as a predictor of subsequent subclinical
      parasitaemia: a cross-sectional survey and malaria case records from three
      villages in Pailin, western Cambodia.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1284-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of the sub-clinical reservoir of malaria, which may
      maintain transmission, could be an important component of elimination strategies.
      The reliable detection of asymptomatic infections with low levels of parasitaemia
      requires high-volume quantitative polymerase chain reaction (uPCR), which is
      impractical to conduct on a large scale. It is unknown to what extent
      sub-clinical parasitaemias originate from recent or older clinical episodes. This
      study explored the association between clinical history of malaria and subsequent
      sub-clinical parasitaemia. METHODS: In June 2013 a cross-sectional survey was
      conducted in three villages in Pailin, western Cambodia. Demographic and
      epidemiological data and blood samples were collected. Blood was tested for
      malaria by high-volume qPCR. Positive samples were analysed by nested PCR to
      determine the Plasmodium species. To identify previous episodes of malaria, case 
      records were collected from village malaria workers and local health facilities
      and linked to study participants. RESULTS: Among 1343 participants, 40/122 (32.8 
      %) with a history of clinical malaria were parasitaemic during the
      cross-sectional survey, compared to 172/1221 (14.1 %) without this history (p <
      0.001). Among the 212 parasitaemic participants in the survey, 40 (18.9 %) had a 
      history of clinical malaria, compared to 87 out of 1131 (7.7 %) parasite-negative
      participants; p < 0.001, adjusted OR 3.3 (95 % CI; 2.1-5.1). A history of
      Plasmodium vivax was associated with sub-clinical P. vivax parasitaemia in the
      survey (p < 0.001), but this association was not seen with Plasmodium falciparum 
      (p = 0.253); only three participants had both P. falciparum parasites in the
      survey and a clinical history of P. falciparum. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical episode
      of vivax malaria was associated with subsequent sub-clinical parasitaemia.
      Treatment of P. vivax with artemisinin-based combination therapy without
      primaquine often resulted in recurrent episodes. Targeting individuals with a
      history of clinical malaria will be insufficient to eliminate the sub-clinical
      reservoir as they constitute a minority of parasitaemias.

TI  - Malaria case clinical profiles and Plasmodium falciparum parasite genetic
      diversity: a cross sectional survey at two sites of different malaria
      transmission intensities in Rwanda.
PG  - 237
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1287-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa with 
      Plasmodium falciparum being the principal cause of malaria disease morbidity and 
      mortality. Plasmodium falciparum virulence is attributed, in part, to its
      population-level genetic diversity-a characteristic that has yet to be studied in
      Rwanda. Characterizing P. falciparum molecular epidemiology in an area is needed 
      for a better understand of malaria transmission and to inform choice of malaria
      control strategies. METHODS: In this health-facility based survey, malaria case
      clinical profiles and parasite densities as well as parasite genetic diversity
      were compared among P. falciparum-infected patients identified at two sites of
      different malaria transmission intensities in Rwanda. Data on demographics and
      clinical features and finger-prick blood samples for microscopy and parasite
      genotyping were collected(.) Nested PCR was used to genotype msp-2 alleles of
      FC27 and 3D7. RESULTS: Patients' variables of age group, sex, fever (both by
      patient report and by measured tympanic temperatures), parasite density, and bed 
      net use were found differentially distributed between the higher endemic (Ruhuha)
      and lower endemic (Mubuga) sites. Overall multiplicity of P. falciparum infection
      (MOI) was 1.73 but with mean MOI found to vary significantly between 2.13 at
      Ruhuha and 1.29 at Mubuga (p < 0.0001). At Ruhuha, expected heterozygosity (EH)
      for FC27 and 3D7 alleles were 0.62 and 0.49, respectively, whilst at Mubuga, EH
      for FC27 and 3D7 were 0.26 and 0.28, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a 
      higher geometrical mean parasite counts, more polyclonal infections, higher MOI, 
      and higher allelic frequency were observed at the higher malaria-endemic (Ruhuha)
      compared to the lower malaria-endemic (Mubuga) area. These differences in malaria
      risk and MOI should be considered when choosing setting-specific malaria control 
      strategies, assessing p. falciparum associated parameters such as drug
      resistance, immunity and impact of used interventions, and in proper
      interpretation of malaria vaccine studies.

      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Malawi, 2014.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1281-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria causes significant morbidity in Malawi, with an estimated 5
      million cases in 2014. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine
      (ASAQ) are the first- and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria,
      respectively, but emerging resistance threatens their efficacy. In order to
      understand whether AL and ASAQ remain efficacious for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Malawi, a therapeutic efficacy
      trial was conducted. METHODS: During March-July 2014, febrile children aged 6-59 
      months with microscopy-confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria
      (1000-200,000 parasites/muL) were enrolled in a 28-day randomized in vivo
      efficacy trial at three sites: one each in northern (Karonga), central
      (Nkhotakota) and southern (Machinga) Malawi. The study was powered to estimate
      site-specific efficacy for AL and overall efficacy for ASAQ, with 3:1
      randomization to AL or ASAQ. Blood was collected for malaria microscopy and
      molecular testing on days 0-3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Recrudescence and reinfection
      were differentiated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping of merozoite
      surface protein. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected day 28 Kaplan-Meier
      cumulative success rate. RESULTS: A total of 452 children were enrolled; 303/338 
      (89 %) and 98/114 (86 %) reached a study endpoint in AL and ASAQ arms,
      respectively. All treatment failures occurred after day 3. The day 28 uncorrected
      cumulative success rate was 97.1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 93.9-100 %)
      for ASAQ and 76.8 % (95 % CI 72.1-81.5 %) for AL, with 82.5 % (95 % CI 75.4-89.7 
      %), 69 % (95 % CI 59.9-78.1 %), and 78.2 % (95 % CI 70.2-86.3 %) success in the
      northern, central, and southern regions, respectively. The day 28 PCR-corrected
      cumulative success rate was 99 % (95 % CI 97.2-100 %) in the ASAQ arm and 99.3 % 
      (95 % CI 98.3-100 %) in the AL arm, with 98-100 % efficacy in each site.
      CONCLUSIONS: As evidenced by the day 28 PCR-corrected cumulative success rates,
      both AL and ASAQ remain efficacious treatments for uncomplicated malaria in
      Malawi. The lower uncorrected efficacy in the AL arm compared to ASAQ may be
      explained by the shorter half-life of lumefantrine (3-6 days) compared to
      amodiaquine (9-18 days). The high reinfection rate suggests that there is a
      continued need to scale-up effective malaria prevention interventions.

AB  - Introduction. The characterization of genetic profile of Plasmodium isolates from
      different areas could help in better strategies for malaria elimination. This
      study aimed to compare P. falciparum diversity in two African countries. Methods.
      Isolates collected from 100 and 73 falciparum malaria infections in sites of Cote
      d'Ivoire (West Africa) and Gabon (Central Africa), respectively, were analyzed by
      a nested PCR amplification of msp1 and msp2 genes. Results. The K1 allelic family
      was widespread in Cote d'Ivoire (64.6%) and in Gabon (56.6%). For msp2, the 3D7
      alleles were more prevalent (>70% in both countries) compared to FC27 alleles. In
      Cote d'Ivoire, the frequencies of multiple infections with msp1 (45.1%) and msp2 
      (40.3%) were higher than those found for isolates from Gabon, that is, 30.2% with
      msp1 and 31.4% with msp2. The overall complexity of infection was 1.66 (SD =
      0.79) in Cote d'Ivoire and 1.58 (SD = 0.83) in Gabon. It decreased with age in
      Cote d'Ivoire in contrast to Gabon. Conclusion. Differences observed in some
      allelic families and in complexity profile may suggest an impact of
      epidemiological facies as well as immunological response on genetic variability
      of P. falciparum.

TI  - Investigation and control of a Plasmodium falciparum malaria outbreak in Shan
      Special Region II of Myanmar along the China-Myanmar Border from June to December
      2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From 2007 to 2013, intensive control measures reduced malaria burden 
      by 90 % along the China-Myanmar border. However, despite these measures a P.
      falciparum malaria outbreak was reported in the Shan Special Region II of Myanmar
      in June of 2014. METHODS: Epidemiological, parasitological and entomological
      investigations were performed. Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DAPQ) was
      immediately administered to treat parasite positive individuals. Long lasting
      insecticidal nets (LLIN), indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides and
      behavior change communication (BCC) were also provided for outbreak control. An
      embedded efficacy study was conducted evaluating DP. Molecular genotyping via
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the Kelch gene on chromosome 13.
      RESULTS: All infections were identified as Plasmodium falciparum by RDT and
      microscopy. Two fatalities resulted from the outbreak. The attack rate was 72.8 %
      (67/92) and the incidence density rate was 14.2 per 100 person-weeks. The
      positive rate of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 72.2 % (65/90) and
      microscopically-determine parasite rate 42.2 % (38/90). Adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
      of multivariate logistic regression analysis for aged <15 years, 15-45 years,
      inappropriate treatment from a private healer and lack of bed nets were 13.51 (95
      % confidence interval, 2.21-105.89), 7.75 (1.48-44.97), 3.78 (1.30-46.18) and
      3.21(1.21-15.19) respectively. In the six surrounding communities of the outbreak
      site, positive RDT rate was 1.2 % (4/328) and microscopically-determine parasite 
      rate 0.6 % (2/328). Two light traps collected a total of 110 anopheline
      mosquitoes including local vectors, An. minimus, An. sinensis and An. maculates. 
      After intensive control, the detection of malaria attacks, parasites and antigen 
      were reduced to zero between July 1 and December 1, 2014. The cure rate of P.
      falciparum patients at day 42 was 94.3 % (95 % CI, 80.8-99.3 %). The PCR did not 
      detect K13-propeller mutations. CONCLUSION: Imported P. falciparum caused the
      outbreak. Age, seeking inappropriate treatment and lack of bed nets were risk
      factors for infection during the outbreak. P. falciparum was sensitive to
      treatment with DAPQ. The integrated measures controlled the outbreak and
      prevented the spread of P. falciparum effectively. The results of this study
      indicate that malaria control on the China-Myanmar border, especially among
      special populations, needs further collaboration between China, Myanmar and
      international societies.

      the elimination process in low and unstable malaria transmission areas, southeast
      of Iran.

AB  - In Iran, the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax has dropped
      after a national malaria elimination program was launched. To estimate the
      likelihood of success and to measure the outcome of malaria intervention tools
      during elimination programs (2008-2012), the population genetic surveys of
      Iranian P. vivax isolates (n=60) were carried out using the CSP genetic marker.
      The results were compared with a similar work that was carried out during a
      control phase (2000-2003) in the same study areas. Based on PCR-RFLP analysis, 49
      (81.67%) of 60 studied samples were VK210 and 11 (18.33%) were VK247 with no
      mixed genotypes. However, 10.97% of P. vivax isolates of control phase harbored
      the mixed genotypes. Sequencing analysis of 50 pvcsp gene showed 14 distinct
      haplotypes, of which 11 and 3 were VK210 and VK247 types, respectively. However, 
      during the control phase, 19 distinct subtypes (11 VK210 and 8 VK247) were
      reported. Also, 7 of 11 VK210 and the VK247F subtypes were new, and 3 out of 7
      new VK210 and VK247F were isolated from the patients with Pakistani nationality. 
      The lower nucleotide diversity per site (pi=0.02017+/-0.00436 and
      pi=0.04525+/-0.00255) and haplotype diversity (Hd=0.513+/-0.093 and
      Hd=0.691+/-0.128) as well as lower In/Del haplotype [Hd(i)=0.243 and 0] and
      nucleotide diversity [pi(i)=0.00078 and 0] were recorded for VK210 and VK247of
      the elimination samples, respectively. In conclusion, the comparison of PRMs and 
      RATs in CRR along with the polymorphism analysis of the sequence lengths, SNPs,
      and In/Del polymorphisms in all analyzed samples showed lower genetic diversity
      for PvCSP in the elimination samples. Also, although there is a turnover of P.
      vivax parasite genotypes in the study areas, reduction in genetic diversity and
      transmission was detected due to scaling-up of the intervention tools during an
      elimination program in Iran. This notable challenge of the elimination program
      must be taken into account and controlled by active surveillance for limiting
      both reintroductions of new allelic forms as well as the spread of drug-resistant
      parasite to prevent any disease outbreaks.

TI  - Examining Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax clearance subsequent to antimalarial
      drug treatment in the Myanmar-China border area based on quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1186/s12879-016-1482-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent emergence of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum has posed a
      serious hindrance to the elimination of malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion. 
      Parasite clearance time, a measure of change in peripheral parasitaemia in a
      sequence of samples taken after treatment, can be used to reflect the
      susceptibility of parasites or the efficiency of antimalarials. The association
      of genetic polymorphisms and artemisinin resistance has been documented. This
      study aims to examine clearance time of P. falciparum and P. vivax parasitemia as
      well as putative gene mutations associated with residual or recurred parasitemia 
      in Myanmar. METHODS: A total of 63 P. falciparum and 130 P. vivax samples
      collected from two internally-displaced populations and one surrounding village
      were examined for parasitemia changes. At least four samples were taken from each
      patient, at the first day of diagnosis up to 3 months following the initial
      treatment. The amount of parasite gene copy number was estimated using
      quantitative real-time PCR based on a species-specific region of the 18S rRNA
      gene. For samples that showed residual or recurred parasitemia after treatment,
      microsatellites were used to identify the 'post-treatment' parasite genotype and 
      compared such with the 'pre-treatment' genotype. Mutations in genes pfcrt,
      pfmdr1, pfatp6, pfmrp1 and pfK13 that are potentially associated with ACT
      resistance were examined to identify if mutation is a factor for residual or
      persistent parasitemia. RESULTS: Over 30% of the P. falciprium infections showed 
      delayed clearance of parasitemia after 2-3 days of treatment and 9.5% showed
      recurred parasitemia. Mutations in codon 876 of the pfmrp1 corroborated
      significance association with slow clearance time. However, no association was
      observed in the variation in pfmdr1 gene copy number as well as mutations of
      various codonsinpfatp6, pfcrt, and pfK13 with clearance time. For P. vivax, over 
      95% of the infections indicated cleared parasitemia at days 2-3 of treatment.
      Four samples were found to be re-infected with new parasite strains based on
      microsatellite genotypes after initial treatment. CONCLUSION: The appearance of
      P.falciparum infected samples showing delayed clearance or recurred parasitemia
      after treatment raises concerns on current treatment and ACT drug resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Indonesian archipelago is endemic for malaria. Although
      Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are the most common causes for malaria cases, 
      P. malariae and P. ovale are also present in certain regions. Zoonotic case of
      malaria had just became the attention of public health communities after the
      Serawak study in 2004. However, zoonotic case in Indonesia is still under
      reported; only one published report of knowlesi malaria in South Kalimantan in
      2010. CASE PRESENTATION: A case of Plasmodium knowlesi infection in a worker from
      a charcoal mining company in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia was described. The
      worker suffered from fever following his visit to a lowland forest being cut and 
      converted into a new mining location. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed a zoonotic
      infection using polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing of 
      plasmodial DNA encoding the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI).

AB  - A panel of 129 Giemsa-stained thick blood spots (TBS) confirmed for Plasmodium
      falciparum infection having different levels of parasite density were collected
      from a malaria endemic area. DNA was extracted and nested polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) assay was performed to amplify P. falciparum DNA. Nested PCR assay
      successfully amplified P. falciparum DNA at a very low parasitaemia of ~10
      parasites/mul of blood. Current PCR assay is very simple and can be used
      retrospectively to monitor the invasion and prevalence of different Plasmodium
      species in endemic areas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to find out the mutational prevalence of
      Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene in Assam
      and Arunachal Pradesh, India. METHODS: To fulfil the objective of the study, a
      total of 54 P. falciparum malaria positive samples were attempted for genotyping 
      of Pfcrt gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing
      method. RESULTS: The K76T mutation was observed in 77.78% cases followed by M74I 
      (61.11%), N75E (61.11%) and C72S (16.67%). Triple mutant allele M74I+N75E+K76T
      was found in 61.11% P. falciparum field isolates. Double mutant allele C72S+K76T 
      was seen among 16.67% samples. Mutation studies have shown existence of three
      different haplotypes of which two were associated with chloroquine resistance.
      The haplotype CVIET was found preponderance and circulated in all four districts.
      The other haplotype SVMNT was observed only in Karbi Anglong district of Assam.
      Maximum haplotype diversity was also recorded from Karbi Anglong district of
      Assam. CONCLUSION: Our study has confirmed high prevalence of mutant Pfcrt
      genotypes associated with chloroquine resistance in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, 
      India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium has a complex biology including the ability to interact
      with host signals modulating their function through cellular machinery. Tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) elicits diverse cellular responses including effects in
      malarial pathology and increased infected erythrocyte cytoadherence. As TNF
      levels are raised during Plasmodium falciparum infection we have investigated
      whether it has an effect on the parasite asexual stage. METHODS: Flow cytometry, 
      spectrofluorimetric determinations, confocal microscopy and PCR real time
      quantifications were employed for characterizing TNF induced effects and membrane
      integrity verified by wheat germ agglutinin staining. RESULTS: TNF is able to
      decrease intracellular parasitemia, involving calcium as a second messenger of
      the pathway. Parasites incubated for 48 h with TNF showed reduced erythrocyte
      invasion. Thus, TNF induced rises in intracellular calcium concentration, which
      were blocked by prior addition of the purinergic receptor agonists KN62 and
      A438079, or interfering with intra- or extracellular calcium release by
      thapsigargin or EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid). Importantly, expression 
      of PfPCNA1 which encodes the Plasmodium falciparum Proliferating-Cell Nuclear
      Antigen 1, decreased after P. falciparum treatment of TNF (tumor necrosis factor)
      or 6-Bnz cAMP (N(6)-benzoyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt).
      CONCLUSIONS: This is potentially interesting data showing the relevance of
      calcium in downregulating a gene involved in cellular proliferation, triggered by
      TNF. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The data show that Plasmodium may subvert the
      immunological system and use TNF for the control of its proliferation within the 
      vertebrate host.

TI  - Malaria hotspots defined by clinical malaria, asymptomatic carriage, PCR and
      vector numbers in a low transmission area on the Kenyan Coast.
PG  - 213
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1260-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeted malaria control interventions are expected to be
      cost-effective. Clinical, parasitological and serological markers of malaria
      transmission have been used to detect malaria transmission hotspots, but few
      studies have examined the relationship between the different potential markers in
      low transmission areas. The present study reports on the relationships between
      clinical, parasitological, serological and entomological markers of malaria
      transmission in an area of low transmission intensity in Coastal Kenya. METHODS: 
      Longitudinal data collected from 831 children aged 5-17 months, cross-sectional
      survey data from 800 older children and adults, and entomological survey data
      collected in Ganze on the Kenyan Coast were used in the present study. The
      spatial scan statistic test used to detect malaria transmission hotspots was
      based on incidence of clinical malaria episodes, prevalence of asymptomatic
      asexual parasites carriage detected by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR), seroprevalence of antibodies to two Plasmodium falciparum merozoite
      antigens (AMA1 and MSP1-19) and densities of Anopheles mosquitoes in CDC
      light-trap catches. RESULTS: There was considerable overlapping of hotspots by
      these different markers, but only weak to moderate correlation between
      parasitological and serological markers. PCR prevalence and seroprevalence of
      antibodies to AMA1 or MSP1-19 appeared to be more sensitive markers of hotspots
      at very low transmission intensity. CONCLUSION: These findings may support the
      choice of either serology or PCR as markers in the detection of malaria
      transmission hotspots for targeted interventions.

AB  - The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) is a recently developed 
      molecular technique that amplifies nucleic acid under isothermal conditions. For 
      malaria diagnosis, 150 blood samples from consecutive febrile malaria patients,
      and healthy subjects were screened in Thailand. Each sample was diagnosed by
      LAMP, microscopy and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), using nPCR as the
      gold standard. Malaria LAMP was performed using Plasmodiumgenus and Plasmodium
      falciparum specific assays in parallel. For the genus Plasmodium, microscopy
      showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, while LAMP presented 99% of
      sensitivity and 93% of specificity. For P. falciparum, microscopy had a
      sensitivity of 95%, and LAMP of 90%, regarding the specificity; and microscopy
      presented 93% and LAMP 97% of specificity. The results of the genus-specific LAMP
      technique were highly consistent with those of nPCR and the sensitivity of P.
      falciparum detection was only marginally lower.

TI  - Mosquito Passage Dramatically Changes var Gene Expression in Controlled Human
      Plasmodium falciparum Infections.
PG  - e1005538
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005538 [doi]
AB  - Virulence of the most deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is linked to 
      the variant surface antigen PfEMP1, which is encoded by about 60 var genes per
      parasite genome. Although the expression of particular variants has been
      associated with different clinical outcomes, little is known about var gene
      expression at the onset of infection. By analyzing controlled human malaria
      infections via quantitative real-time PCR, we show that parasite populations from
      18 volunteers expressed virtually identical transcript patterns that were
      dominated by the subtelomeric var gene group B and, to a lesser extent, group A. 
      Furthermore, major changes in composition and frequency of var gene transcripts
      were detected between the parental parasite culture that was used to infect
      mosquitoes and Plasmodia recovered from infected volunteers, suggesting that P.
      falciparum resets its var gene expression during mosquito passage and starts with
      the broad expression of a specific subset of var genes when entering the human
      blood phase.

AB  - We evaluated the clinical efficacy of artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) fixed-dose
      combination to treat uncomplicated malaria in Jurua Valley, the main Plasmodium
      falciparum transmission hotspot in Brazil. Between November 2010 and February
      2013, we enrolled 162 patients aged 4-73 years, with fever or a history of fever,
      and a single-species P. falciparum infection confirmed by microscopy and
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All 154 patients who completed the 42-day
      follow-up presented an adequate clinical and parasitologic response. ASMQ was
      well tolerated and no adverse event caused treatment interruption. Gametocytes
      were detected in 46.3% patients; 35.2% had gametocytes at enrollment, whereas
      others developed patent gametocytemia 1-14 days after starting ASMQ. By day 3 of 
      treatment, all subjects had cleared asexual parasitemia, but parasite DNA
      remained PCR detectable in 37.6% of them. Day-3 PCR positivity was associated
      with prolonged gametocyte carriage. We found no molecular evidence of resistance 
      to either MQ (pfmdr1 gene amplification) or AS (mutations in selected kelch13
      gene domains known to be associated with AS resistance) in the local P.
      falciparum population. These results strongly support the use of ASMQ as a
      first-line regimen to treat uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in northwestern
      Brazil, but underscore the need for gametocytocidal drugs to reduce the
      transmission potential of ASMQ-treated patients (ClinicalTrials.gov number
      NCT01144702).

TI  - Plasmodium copy number variation scan: gene copy numbers evaluation in haploid
      genomes.
PG  - 206
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1258-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In eukaryotic genomes, deletion or amplification rates have been
      estimated to be a thousand more frequent than single nucleotide variation. In
      Plasmodium falciparum, relatively few transcription factors have been identified,
      and the regulation of transcription is seemingly largely influenced by gene
      amplification events. Thus copy number variation (CNV) is a major mechanism
      enabling parasite genomes to adapt to new environmental changes. METHODS:
      Currently, the detection of CNVs is based on quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is
      significantly limited by the relatively small number of genes that can be
      analysed at any one time. Technological advances that facilitate whole-genome
      sequencing, such as next generation sequencing (NGS) enable deeper analyses of
      the genomic variation to be performed. Because the characteristics of Plasmodium 
      CNVs need special consideration in algorithms and strategies for which classical 
      CNV detection programs are not suited a dedicated algorithm to detect CNVs across
      the entire exome of P. falciparum was developed. This algorithm is based on a
      custom read depth strategy through NGS data and called PlasmoCNVScan. RESULTS:
      The analysis of CNV identification on three genes known to have different levels 
      of amplification and which are located either in the nuclear, apicoplast or
      mitochondrial genomes is presented. The results are correlated with the qPCR
      experiments, usually used for identification of locus specific
      amplification/deletion. CONCLUSIONS: This tool will facilitate the study of P.
      falciparum genomic adaptation in response to ecological changes: drug pressure,
      decreased transmission, reduction of the parasite population size (transition to 
      pre-elimination endemic area).

TI  - Behaviour and molecular identification of Anopheles malaria vectors in Jayapura
      district, Papua province, Indonesia.
PG  - 192
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1234-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Members of the Anopheles punctulatus group dominate Papua, Indonesia 
      and Papua New Guinea (PNG), with a geographic range that extends south through
      Vanuatu. An. farauti and An. punctulatus are the presumed major vectors in this
      region. Although this group of species has been extensively studied in PNG and
      the southern archipelagoes within their range, their distribution, ecology and
      vector behaviours have not been well characterized in eastern Indonesia. METHODS:
      Mosquitoes were collected in five villages in Jayapura province, Papua, Indonesia
      using human-landing collections, animal-baited tents and backpack aspirators.
      Mosquitoes were morphologically typed and then molecularly distinguished based on
      ribosomal ITS2 sequences and tested for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax
      infection using circumsporozoite ELISA and PCR. RESULTS: The presence and vector 
      status of An. farauti 4 in Papua, Indonesia is confirmed here for the first time.
      The data indicate that this species is entering houses at a rate that increases
      its potential to come into contact with humans and act as a major malaria vector.
      An. farauti 4 was also abundant outdoors and biting humans during early evening
      hours. Other species collected in this area include An. farauti 1, An. hinesorum,
      An. koliensis, An. punctulatus, and An. tessellatus. Proboscis morphology was
      highly variable within each species, lending support to the notion that this
      characteristic is not a reliable indicator to distinguish species within the An. 
      punctulatus group. CONCLUSIONS: The vector composition in Papua, Indonesia is
      consistent with certain northern areas of PNG, but the behaviours of anophelines 
      sampled in this region, such as early and indoor human biting of An. farauti 4,
      may enable them to act as major vectors of malaria. Presumed major vectors An.
      farauti and An. punctulatus were not abundant among these samples. Morphological 
      identification of anophelines in this sample was often inaccurate, highlighting
      the importance of using molecular analysis in conjunction with morphological
      investigations to update keys and training tools.

TI  - High heterogeneity of malaria transmission and a large sub-patent and diverse

AB  - BACKGROUND: Yemen remains the country with the highest malaria transmission
      within the Arabian Peninsula and a source of imported cases to neighbouring
      countries. METHODS: This study collected samples from individuals resident in a
      valley in Western Yemen as a baseline to examine infection prevalence for a
      future trial. As well as rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopy, a filter
      paper blood spot was collected for molecular and serological analyses. RESULTS:
      Samples were collected from 2261 individuals from 12 clusters across a study area
      of approximately 100 km(2). Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence was 12.4, 
      11.1 and 19.6% by RDT, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
      respectively. RDT and microscopy did not detect 45% of infections present,
      suggesting many infections were low-density. Infection prevalence and
      seroprevalence were highly heterogeneous between clusters, with evidence of
      higher exposure in clusters close to the wadi. The mean multiplicity of infection
      (MOI) was 2.3 and high heterozygosity and allelic richness were detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: This highly diverse parasite population suggests a high degree of
      transmissibility and coupled with the substantial proportion of low-density
      infections, may pose challenges for malaria control and elimination efforts.

TI  - Limited artemisinin resistance-associated polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum 
      K13-propeller and PfATPase6 gene isolated from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.
PG  - 54-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpddr.2015.11.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With emergence and geographically expanding of antimalarial resistance
      worldwide, molecular markers are essential tool for surveillance of resistant
      Plasmodium parasites. Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller (K13-propeller) domain are shown to be associated
      with artemisinin (ART) resistance in vivo and in vitro. This study aims to
      investigate the ART resistance-associated polymorphisms of K13-propeller and
      PfATPase6 genes in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Bioko Island, Equatorial
      Guinea (EG). METHODS: A total of 172 samples were collected from falciparum
      malaria patients on Bioko Island between 2013 and 2014. The polymorphisms of
      K13-propeller and PfATPase6 genes were analyzed by Nest-PCR and sequencing.
      RESULTS: Sequences of K13-propeller and PfATPase6 were obtained from 90.74%
      (98/108) and 91.45% (139/152) samples, respectively. The 2.04% (2/98) cases had
      non-synonymous K13-propeller A578S mutation but no found the mutations associated
      with ART resistance in Southeast Asia. For PfATPase6, the mutations were found at
      positions N569K and A630S with the mutation prevalence of 7.91% (11/139) and
      1.44% (2/139), respectively. In addition, a sample with the mixed type at
      position I723V was discovered (0.72%, 1/139). CONCLUSIONS: This study initially
      offers an insight of K13-propeller and PfATPase6 polymorphisms on Bioko Island,
      EG. It suggests no widespread ART resistance or tolerance in the region, and
      might be helpful for developing and updating guidance for the use of ART-based
      combination therapies (ACTs).

AB  - The study of the interactions among parasites within their hosts is crucial to
      the understanding of epidemiology of disease and for the design of effective
      control strategies. We have conducted an assessment of infections with Loa loa,
      Mansonella perstans, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Plasmodium falciparum in eastern
      Cameroon using a highly sensitive and specific quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction assay using archived dried whole blood spots. The resident population (N
      = 1,085) was parasitized with M. perstans (76%), L. loa (39%), and P. falciparum 
      (33%), but not with W. bancrofti Compared with single infections (40.1%),
      coinfection was more common (48.8%): 21.0% had L. loa-M. perstans
      (Ll(+)/Mp(+)/Pf(-)), 2.7% had L. loa-P. falciparum (Ll(+)/Pf(+)/Mp(-)), 15.1% had
      M. perstans-P. falciparum (Mp(+)/Pf(+)/Ll(-)), and 10.0% had L. loa-M.
      perstans-P. falciparum (Ll(+)/Mp(+)/Pf(+)). Interestingly, those with all three
      infections (Ll(+)/Mp(+)/Pf(+)) had significantly higher L. loa microfilaria (mf) 
      counts than either single Ll(+) (P = 0.004) or double Ll(+)/Mp(+) (P = 0.024)
      infected individuals. Of those infected with L. loa, the mean estimated counts of
      L. loa mf varied based on location and were positively correlated with estimated 
      intensities of M. perstans mf. Finally, at a community level, heavy L. loa
      infections were concentrated in a few individuals whereby they were likely the
      major reservoir for infection.

      heme-mediated signaling pathway.
PG  - 1009-18
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S96863 [doi]
AB  - Heme is cytotoxic to the plasmodium parasite, which converts it to an insoluble
      crystalline form called hemozoin (malaria pigment) in erythrocytes during
      replication. The increased serum levels of free heme cause tissue damage,
      activation of microvascular endothelial and glial cells, focal inflammation,
      activation of apoptotic pathways, and neuronal tissue damage. Several hypotheses 
      have been proposed to explain how these causative factors exacerbate fatal
      malaria. However, none of them fully explain the detailed mechanisms leading to
      the high morbidity and mortality associated with malaria. We have previously
      reported that heme-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBVEC) apoptosis
      is a major contributor to severe malaria pathogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that
      heme (at clinically relevant levels) induces inflammation and apoptosis in HBVEC,
      a process that is mediated by independent proinflammatory and proapoptotic
      signaling pathways. In this study, we determined the key signaling molecules
      associated with heme-mediated apoptosis in HBVEC in vitro using RT2 profiler
      polymerase chain reaction array technology and confirmed results using
      immunostaining techniques. While several expressed genes in HBVEC were altered
      upon heme stimulation, we determined that the apoptotic effects of heme were
      mediated through p73 (tumor protein p73). The results provide an opportunity to
      target heme-mediated apoptosis therapeutically in malaria-infected individuals.

AB  - The adoption of Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACT) constitutes a basic
      strategy for malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, since cases of ACT 
      resistance have been reported in South-East Asia, the need to understand P.
      falciparum resistance mechanism to ACT has become a global research goal. The
      selective pressure of ACT and the possibility that some specific Pfcrt and Pfmdr1
      alleles are associated with treatment failures was assessed in a clinical trial
      comparing ASAQ to AL in Nanoro. Dried blood spots collected on Day 0 and on the
      day of recurrent parasitaemia during the 28-day follow-up were analyzed using the
      restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to detect single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Pfcrt (codon76) and Pfmdr1 (codons 86, 184,
      1034, 1042, and 1246) genes. Multivariate analysis of the relationship between
      the presence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles and treatment outcome was performed. AL 
      and ASAQ exerted opposite trends in selecting Pfcrt K76T and Pfmdr1-N86Y alleles,
      raising the potential beneficial effect of using diverse ACT at the same time as 
      first line treatments to reduce the selective pressure by each treatment regimen.
      No clear association between the presence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles carried at 
      baseline and treatment failure was observed.

AB  - Unlike other countries, the chloroquine resistant marker Pfcrt T76 mutant has
      remained fairly stable in Ghana several years after official disuse of
      chloroquine. Certain mutations in Pfmdr1 may potentiate Pfcrt T76, offering a
      possible explanation for this observation. To understand the phenomenon, the
      co-existence of mutations in Pfmdr1 with Pfcrt T76 in Ghanaian Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates was studied. The reported presence of parasites with reduced 
      sensitivity to amodiaquine and quinine in the country was also studied. Blood
      samples collected from confirmed malaria patients presenting at health facilities
      in two distinct ecological zones were analyzed. The prevalence of Pfcrt K76T and 
      the five point mutations in Pfmdr1 were determined using nested PCR followed by
      RFLP analysis. The association between genes was determined by chi square
      analysis, and synergism between the two genes was ascertained using the
      Jonckheere-Terptra (J-T) test followed by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Nearly
      fifty-four percent (53.7%) of the P. falciparum isolates examined had the Pfcrt
      T76 gene, out of which 18.3% had both K76 and T76 alleles. Mutations at codon 86,
      184, 1034, 1042 and 1246 of the Pfmdr1 gene were detected in 36.0%, 87.9%, 71.0%,
      91.6% and 8.4% of the isolates, respectively. The haplotypes of Pfmdr1 present
      were NFCDD (43.46%), YFCDD (27.57%), NFSDD (7.48%), NYSNY (5.14%) and YFSDD
      (4.67%). Pfcrt T76 was significantly associated with a double mutation at codon
      86 and 184 of Pfmdr1 (YF; chi2=18.045, p=0.006). Associations were observed
      between Pfcrt K76T and Pfmdr1 triple mutation at codons 86, 184 and 1034 (NFC;
      chi2=13.770, p=0.032 and YFC; chi2=16.489, p=0.011). The J-T test showed
      significant synergism between Pfcrt 76 and Pfmdr1 polymorphisms (p<0.0001), which
      was confirmed by MCS at 99% CI. Synergism between Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 mutant genes
      could account for the slow recovery of chloroquine sensitive P. falciparum in
      Ghana. The same phenomenon could explain resistance to amodiaquine and quinine.
      The outcomes of this study also indicated a possible emergence of
      artemether-lumefantrine resistance in Ghana.

AB  - Microscopy and field adaptable rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are not sensitive
      and specific in certain conditions such as poor training of microscopists, lack
      of electricity, or lower sensitivity in the detection of non-falciparum malaria. 
      More sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) would reduce delays in diagnosis and 
      initiation of therapy. In the current study, we have evaluated the efficacy of
      noninstrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) coupled with loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (LAMP) for detection of traveler's malaria (n=140) in
      comparison with microscopy, nested PCR, and the only Food and Drug
      Administration-approved rapid diagnostic test. NINA-LAMP was 100% sensitive and
      98.6% specific when compared to nested PCR. For non-falciparum detection,
      NINA-LAMP sensitivity was 100% sensitive compared to nested PCR, whereas RDT
      sensitivity was 71%. LAMP is highly sensitive and specific for symptomatic
      malaria diagnosis regardless of species.

      Cambodian population: implications for prevention, treatment and elimination
      strategies.
PG  - 181

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subclinical Plasmodium parasitaemia is an important reservoir for the
      transmission and persistence of malaria, particularly in low transmission areas. 
      METHODS: Using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR (uPCR) for the detection of
      parasitaemia, the entire population of three Cambodian villages in Pailin
      province were followed for 1 year at three-monthly intervals. A cohort of adult
      participants found initially to have asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia was
      followed monthly over the same period. RESULTS: The initial cross sectional
      survey in June 2013 (M0) of 1447 asymptomatic residents found that 32 (2.2%) had 
      Plasmodium falciparum, 48 (3.3%) had P. vivax, 4 (0.3%) had mixed infections and 
      in 142/1447 (9.8%) malaria was detected but there was insufficient DNA to
      identify the species (Plasmodium. species). Polymorphisms in the 'K13-propeller' 
      associated with reduced susceptibility to artemisinin derivatives (C580Y) were
      found in 17/32 (51%) P. falciparum strains. Monthly follow-up without treatment
      of 24 adult participants with asymptomatic mono or mixed P. falciparum infections
      found that 3/24 (13%) remained parasitaemic for 2-4 months, whereas the remaining
      21/24 (87%) participants had cleared their parasitaemia after 1 month. In
      contrast, 12/34 (35%) adult participants with P. vivax mono-infection at M0 had
      malaria parasites (P. vivax or P. sp.) during four or more of the following 11
      monthly surveys. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal survey in a low transmission
      setting shows limited duration of P. falciparum carriage, but prolonged carriage 
      of P. vivax infections. Radical treatment of P. vivax infections by
      8-aminoquinoline regimens may be required to eliminate all malaria from Cambodia.

AB  - The development of a sterilizing and cost-effective vaccine against malaria
      remains a major problem despite recent advances. In this study, it is
      demonstrated that two antigens of P. falciparum UB05, UB09 and their chimera
      UB05-09 can serve as protective immunity markers by eliciting higher T-cell
      responses in malaria semi-immune subjects (SIS) than in frequently sick subjects 
      (FSS) and could be used to distinguish these two groups. UB05, UB09 and UB05-09
      were cloned, expressed in E. coli, purified and used to stimulate PBMCs isolated 
      from 63 subjects in a malaria endemic area, for IFN-gamma production, which was
      measured by the ELISpot assay. The polymorphism of UB09 gene in the malaria
      infected population was also studied by PCR/sequencing of the gene in P.
      falciparum field isolates. All three antigens were preferentially recognized by
      PBMCs from SIS. IFN-gamma production induced by these antigens correlated with
      the absence of fever and parasitaemia. UB09 was shown to be relatively
      well-conserved in nature. It is concluded that UB05, UB09 and the chimera UB05-09
      posses T-cell epitopes that are associated with protection against malaria and
      could thus be used to distinguish SIS from FSS eventhough acute infection with
      malaria has been shown to reduce cytokine production in some studies. Further
      investigations of these antigens as potential diagnostic and/or vaccine
      candidates for malaria are indicated.

TI  - Microsatellite Genotyping of Plasmodium vivax Isolates from Pregnant Women in
      Four Malaria Endemic Countries.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152447 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed human parasite and the main cause
      of human malaria outside the African continent. However, the knowledge about the 
      genetic variability of P. vivax is limited when compared to the information
      available for P. falciparum. We present the results of a study aimed at
      characterizing the genetic structure of P. vivax populations obtained from
      pregnant women from different malaria endemic settings. Between June 2008 and
      October 2011 nearly 2000 pregnant women were recruited during routine antenatal
      care at each site and followed up until delivery. A capillary blood sample from
      the study participants was collected for genotyping at different time points.
      Seven P. vivax microsatellite markers were used for genotypic characterization on
      a total of 229 P. vivax isolates obtained from Brazil, Colombia, India and Papua 
      New Guinea. In each population, the number of alleles per locus, the expected
      heterozygosity and the levels of multilocus linkage disequilibrium were assessed.
      The extent of genetic differentiation among populations was also estimated. Six
      microsatellite loci on 137 P. falciparum isolates from three countries were
      screened for comparison. The mean value of expected heterozygosity per country
      ranged from 0.839 to 0.874 for P. vivax and from 0.578 to 0.758 for P.
      falciparum. P. vivax populations were more diverse than those of P. falciparum.
      In some of the studied countries, the diversity of P. vivax population was very
      high compared to the respective level of endemicity. The level of
      inter-population differentiation was moderate to high in all P. vivax and P.
      falciparum populations studied.

TI  - MOLECULAR SURVEILLANCE OF Plasmodium vivax AND Plasmodium falciparum DHFR
      MUTATIONS IN ISOLATES FROM SOUTHERN IRAN.

AB  - In Iran, both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum malaria have been detected, but 
      P. vivax is the predominant species. Point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase
      (dhfr) gene in both Plasmodia are the major mechanisms of pyrimethamine
      resistance. From April 2007 to June 2009, a total of 134 blood samples in two
      endemic areas of southern Iran were collected from patients infected with P.
      vivax and P. falciparum. The isolates were analyzed for P. vivax dihydrofolate
      reductase (pvdhfr) and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) point
      mutations using various PCR-based methods. The majority of the isolates (72.9%)
      had wild type amino acids at five codons of pvdhfr. Amongst mutant isolates, the 
      most common pvdhfr alleles were double mutant in 58 and 117 amino acids
      (58R-117N). Triple mutation in 57, 58, and 117 amino acids (57L/58R/117N) was
      identified for the first time in the pvdhfr gene of Iranian P. vivax isolates.
      All the P. falciparumsamples analyzed (n = 16) possessed a double mutant
      pfdhfrallele (59R/108N) and retained a wild-type mutation at position 51. This
      may be attributed to the fact that the falciparum malaria patients were treated
      using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Iran. The presence of mutant haplotypes
      in P. vivax is worrying, but has not yet reached an alarming threshold regarding 
      drugs such as SP. The results of this study reinforce the importance of
      performing a molecular surveillance by means of a continuous chemoresistance
      assessment.

PG  - 11078
LID - 10.1038/ncomms11078 [doi]
AB  - African apes harbour at least six Plasmodium species of the subgenus Laverania,
      one of which gave rise to human Plasmodium falciparum. Here we use a selective
      amplification strategy to sequence the genome of chimpanzee parasites classified 
      as Plasmodium reichenowi and Plasmodium gaboni based on the subgenomic fragments.
      Genome-wide analyses show that these parasites indeed represent distinct species,
      with no evidence of cross-species mating. Both P. reichenowi and P. gaboni are
      10-fold more diverse than P. falciparum, indicating a very recent origin of the
      human parasite. We also find a remarkable Laverania-specific expansion of a
      multigene family involved in erythrocyte remodelling, and show that a short
      region on chromosome 4, which encodes two essential invasion genes, was
      horizontally transferred into a recent P. falciparum ancestor. Our results
      validate the selective amplification strategy for characterizing cryptic pathogen
      species, and reveal evolutionary events that likely predisposed the precursor of 
      P. falciparum to colonize humans.

AB  - Heterozygous hemoglobin S (HbAS), or sickle trait, protects children from
      life-threatening falciparum malaria, potentially by attenuating binding of
      Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) to extracellular ligands. Such
      binding is central to the pathogenesis of placental malaria (PM). We hypothesized
      that HbAS would be associated with reduced risks of PM and low birth weight
      (LBW). We tested this hypothesis in 850 delivering women in southern Malawi.
      Parasites were detected by polymerase chain reaction in placental and peripheral 
      blood, and placentae were scored histologically for PM. The prevalence of HbAS
      was 3.7%, and 11.2% of infants were LBW (< 2,500 g). The prevalence of Plasmodium
      falciparum was 12.7% in placental and 8.5% in peripheral blood; 24.4% of
      placentae demonstrated histological evidence of P. falciparum HbAS was not
      associated with reduced prevalence of P. falciparum in placental (odds ratio
      [OR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50-3.23, P = 0.61) or peripheral
      blood (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.08-2.54, P = 0.03), prevalence of histological PM (OR:
      0.97, 95% CI: 0.40-2.34, P = 0.95), or prevalence of LBW (OR: 0.82, 95% CI:
      0.24-2.73, P = 0.74). Mean (standard deviation) birth weights of infants born to 
      HbAS (2,947 g [563]) and, homozygous hemoglobin A (2,991 g [465]) mothers were
      similar. Across a range of parasitologic, clinical, and histologic outcomes, HbAS
      did not confer protection from PM or its adverse effects.

AB  - We evaluated the use of positive malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) to
      determine genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in Mali. Genetic diversity
      was assessed via multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA).
      We performed DNA extraction from 104 positive and 30 negative used mRDTs that had
      been stored at ambient temperature for up to 14 months. Extracted DNA was
      analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and MLVA genotyping
      was then assessed on positive qPCR samples. Eighty-three of the positive mRDTs
      (83/104, 79.8%) and none of the negative mRDTs were confirmed P. falciparum
      positive via qPCR. We achieved complete genotyping of 90.4% (75/83) of the
      qPCR-positive samples. Genotyping revealed high genetic diversity among P.
      falciparum populations in Mali and an absence of population clustering. We show
      that mRDTs are useful to monitor P. falciparum genetic diversity and thereby can 
      provide essential data to guide malaria control programs.

AB  - Malaria remains common in sub-Saharan Africa, but it is frequently over-diagnosed
      and over-treated in hospitalized children. HIV is prevalent in many malaria
      endemic areas and may delay parasite clearance and increase mortality among
      children with malaria. This prospective cohort study enrolled children with
      suspected malaria between 3 months and 12 years of age hospitalized at two
      referral hospitals in Tanzania. Both a thick blood smear (BS) and a malaria rapid
      diagnostic test (mRDT) were performed. If discordant results were obtained, PCR
      was performed for Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria was confirmed if two out of
      three tests were positive. Malaria parasite densities were determined for two
      consecutive days after diagnosis and treatment of malaria. All participants were 
      tested for HIV. Among 1492 hospitalized children, 400 (26.8%) were enrolled with 
      suspected malaria infection. There were 196/400 (49.0%) males, and the median age
      was 18 [9-36] months. BS was positive in 95/400 (23.8%), and mRDT was positive in
      70/400 (17.5%), with moderate agreement (Kappa=0.598). Concordant results
      excluded malaria in 291/400 (72.8%) and confirmed malaria in 56/400 (14.0%). PCR 
      performed on 53 discordant results confirmed malaria in 1/39 of the
      BS-positive/mRDT-negative cases, and 6/14 of the BS-negative/mRDT-positive cases.
      The prevalence of confirmed malaria was 63/400 (15.8%). In multivariable logistic
      regression, malaria was associated with HIV (OR 3.45 [1.65-7.20], p=0.001).
      Current breastfeeding (OR 0.25 [0.11-0.56], p=0.001) and higher hemoglobin (OR
      0.70 [0.60-0.81], p<0.001 per 1g/dL) were associated with decreased odds of
      malaria. Malaria parasite clearance was delayed in HIV-infected participants
      (p<0.001). Malaria is over-diagnosed even at referral centers in high
      transmission areas. Hospitalized HIV-infected children are more likely to have
      malaria and exhibit delayed clearance of parasites. Hospitals should consider
      using mRDTs as a first step for malaria testing among hospitalized children in
      sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Detection of chloroquine and artemisinin resistance molecular markers in
      Plasmodium falciparum: A hospital based study.
PG  - 69-77
LID - 10.4103/2229-5070.175110 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emergence of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
      has increased the morbidity and mortality of falciparum malaria worldwide.
      Artemisinin-based combination therapies are now recommended by the World Health
      Organization as the first line treatment for falciparum malaria. Numerous
      molecular markers have been implicated in the CQ and artemisinin resistance.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 26 confirmed cases of falciparum malaria (by
      giemsa stained thick and thin smear, quantitative buffy coat,
      immunochromatographic test, or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were included in 
      the study. About 5 ml of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood sample was
      collected and stored at -20 degrees C till use. Plasmodium DNA was extracted
      using QIAamp whole blood DNA extraction kit. PCR was done to amplify pfcrt,
      pfmdr1, pfserca, and pfmrp1 genes and the amplicons obtained were sequenced by
      Macrogen, Inc., Korea. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was done
      using Bio-Edit Sequence Alignment Editor. RESULTS: Out of the four genes
      targeted, we noted a SNP in the pfcrt gene alone. This SNP (G > T) was noted in
      the 658(th) position of the gene, which was seen in 13 patients. The pfmdr1 and
      pfserca genes were present in 9 and 14 patients respectively. But we could not
      find any SNPs in these genes. This SNP in pfcrt gene was not significantly
      associated with any adverse outcome and neither altered disease progression.
      CONCLUSION: Presence of a single SNP may not be associated with any adverse
      clinical outcome. As the sample size was small, we may have not been able to
      detect any other known or unknown polymorphisms.

AB  - Intense research efforts have been focused on the improvement of the efficiency
      and sensitivity of malaria diagnostics, especially in resource-limited settings
      for the detection of asymptomatic infections. Our recently developed
      magneto-optical (MO) method allows the accurate quantification of malaria pigment
      crystals (hemozoin) in blood by their magnetically induced rotation. First
      evaluations of the method using beta-hematin crystals and in vitro P. falciparum 
      cultures implied its potential for high-sensitivity malaria diagnosis. To further
      investigate this potential, here we study the performance of the method in
      monitoring the in vivo onset and progression of the blood-stage infection in a
      rodent malaria model. Our results show that the MO method can detect the first
      generation of intraerythrocytic P. berghei parasites 66-76 hours after sporozoite
      injection, demonstrating similar sensitivity to Giesma-stained light microscopy
      and exceeding that of flow cytometric techniques. Magneto-optical measurements
      performed during and after the treatment of P. berghei infections revealed that
      both the follow up under treatment and the detection of later reinfections are
      feasible with this new technique. The present study demonstrates that the MO
      method - besides being label and reagent-free, automated and rapid - has a high
      in vivo sensitivity and is ready for in-field evaluation.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from concurrent malaria and
      arbovirus co-infections in Kedougou, southeastern Senegal.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1208-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concurrent malaria and arbovirus infections are common and represent 
      an important public health concern in regions where both diseases are endemic.
      The present study investigates the genetic diversity and complexity of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection in concurrent malaria-arbovirus infections in Kedougou
      region, southeastern Senegal. METHODS: Parasite DNA was extracted from 60 to 27
      sera samples collected from P. falciparum isolates of malaria and concurrent
      malaria-arbovirus infected patients, respectively, and followed by PCR-genotyping
      targeting the msp-1 (block2) and msp-2 (block3) allelic families. RESULTS: The
      mean number of genotype per allelic family was comparable between the two groups.
      K1 was the predominant msp-1 allelic type both in malaria (94.91%) and
      arbovirus-malaria (92.59%) groups, whereas IC/3D7 was the most prevalent msp-2
      allelic type in malaria (94.91%) and arbovirus-malaria (96.29%) groups.
      Frequencies of msp-1 and msp-2 allelic types were statistically comparable
      between the two groups (Fisher exact test, P > 0.05) and were not associated with
      age. FC27 was strikingly the least prevalent in both groups and was absent in
      children under 5 years of age. The proportions of P. falciparum isolates from
      malaria-infected patients carrying the three msp-1 allelic types (67.44%) or the 
      two msp-2 allelic types (76.47%) were significantly higher than those from
      arbovirus-malaria co-infected patients (Exact binomial test, P < 0.05). The
      multiplicities of infection (MOI) were low and comparable for msp-1 (1.19 vs
      1.22) and msp-2 (1.11 vs 1.10), respectively between malaria and
      arbovirus-malaria groups. CONCLUSION: The study showed no difference in the
      genetic diversity between P. falciparum isolates from malaria and concurrent
      malaria-arbovirus infected patients in Kedougou. The MOI was low despite intense 
      malaria transmission in Kedougou. The overall results suggest a limited or no
      influence of arbovirus infections on P. falciparum diversity and complexity of
      malaria infection.

TI  - Four Artemisinin-Based Treatments in African Pregnant Women with Malaria.
PG  - 913-27
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1508606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding the safety and efficacy of artemisinin
      combination treatments for malaria in pregnant women is limited, particularly
      among women who live in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, 
      randomized, open-label trial of treatments for malaria in pregnant women in four 
      African countries. A total of 3428 pregnant women in the second or third
      trimester who had falciparum malaria (at any parasite density and regardless of
      symptoms) were treated with artemether-lumefantrine, amodiaquine-artesunate,
      mefloquine-artesunate, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The primary end points 
      were the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-adjusted cure rates (i.e., cure of the
      original infection; new infections during follow-up were not considered to be
      treatment failures) at day 63 and safety outcomes. RESULTS: The PCR-adjusted cure
      rates in the per-protocol analysis were 94.8% in the artemether-lumefantrine
      group, 98.5% in the amodiaquine-artesunate group, 99.2% in the
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, and 96.8% in the mefloquine-artesunate
      group; the PCR-adjusted cure rates in the intention-to-treat analysis were 94.2%,
      96.9%, 98.0%, and 95.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference among 
      the amodiaquine-artesunate group, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, and the
      mefloquine-artesunate group. The cure rate in the artemether-lumefantrine group
      was significantly lower than that in the other three groups, although the
      absolute difference was within the 5-percentage-point margin for equivalence. The
      unadjusted cure rates, used as a measure of the post-treatment prophylactic
      effect, were significantly lower in the artemether-lumefantrine group (52.5%)
      than in groups that received amodiaquine-artesunate (82.3%),
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (86.9%), or mefloquine-artesunate (73.8%). No
      significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events and in birth
      outcomes was found among the treatment groups. Drug-related adverse events such
      as asthenia, poor appetite, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting occurred
      significantly more frequently in the mefloquine-artesunate group (50.6%) and the 
      amodiaquine-artesunate group (48.5%) than in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      group (20.6%) and the artemether-lumefantrine group (11.5%) (P<0.001 for
      comparison among the four groups). CONCLUSIONS: Artemether-lumefantrine was
      associated with the fewest adverse effects and with acceptable cure rates but
      provided the shortest post-treatment prophylaxis, whereas
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had the best efficacy and an acceptable safety
      profile. (Funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials
      Partnership and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00852423.).

TI  - New molecular settings to support in vivo anti-malarial assays.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1205-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is now commonly used as a method to
      confirm diagnosis of malaria and to differentiate recrudescence from
      re-infection, especially in clinical trials and in reference laboratories where
      precise quantification is critical. Although anti-malarial drug discovery is
      based on in vivo murine efficacy models, use of molecular analysis has been
      limited. The aim of this study was to develop qPCR as a valid methodology to
      support pre-clinical anti-malarial models by using filter papers to maintain
      material for qPCR and to compare this with traditional methods. METHODS: FTA
      technology (Whatman) is a rapid and safe method for extracting nucleic acids from
      blood. Peripheral blood samples from mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, P.
      yoelii, or P. falciparum were kept as frozen samples or as spots on FTA cards.
      The extracted genetic material from both types of samples was assessed for
      quantification by qPCR using sets of specific primers specifically designed for
      Plasmodium 18S rRNA, LDH, and CytB genes. RESULTS: The optimal conditions for
      nucleic acid extraction from FTA cards and qPCR amplification were set up, and
      were confirmed to be suitable for parasite quantification using DNA as template
      after storage at room temperature for as long as 26 months in the case of P.
      berghei samples and 52 months for P. falciparum and P. yoelii. The quality of DNA
      extracted from the FTA cards for gene sequencing and microsatellite amplification
      was also assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the suitability
      of FTA cards and qPCR assay to quantify parasite load in samples from in vivo
      efficacy models to support the drug discovery process.

AB  - The need to develop new effective antimalarial agents is urgent due to the rapid 
      emergence of drug resistance to all current drugs by the most virulent human
      malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. A promising avenue is in the development
      of antimalarials based on RNA interference targeting expression of malaria
      parasite vital genes, viz. DNA topoisomerase II gene (PfTOP2). Biodegradable
      chitosan nanoparticle system has proven to be effective in delivering DNA and
      small double-stranded interfering RNA to target cells. We have employed a long
      double-stranded (dsRNA) targeting the coding region of PfTOP2 that is complexed
      with chitosan nanoparticles in order to interfere with the cognate mRNA
      expression and examined its effect on P. falciparum growth in culture. Exposure
      of ring stage-infected erythrocytes to 10 mug/ml PfTOP2 chitosan/dsRNA
      nanoparticles for 48 h resulted in 71% growth inhibition as determined by [(3)H] 
      hypoxanthine incorporation and microscopic assays, compared with 41% inhibition
      using an equivalent amount of free PfTOP2 dsRNA or 12% with unrelated
      chitosan/dsRNA nanoparticles. This inhibition was shown to occur during
      maturation of trophozoite to schizont stages. RT-PCR analysis indicated 56% and
      38% decrease in PfTOP2 transcript levels in P. falciparum trophozoites treated
      with PfTOP2 dsRNA nanoparticles and free PfTOP2 dsRNA respectively. These results
      suggest that chitosan-based nanoparticles might be a useful tool for delivering
      dsRNA into malaria parasites.

TI  - Single low dose primaquine to reduce gametocyte carriage and Plasmodium
      falciparum transmission after artemether-lumefantrine in children with
      asymptomatic infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s12916-016-0581-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single low dose (0.25 mg/kg) of primaquine is recommended as a
      gametocytocide in combination with artemisinin-based combination therapies for
      Plasmodium falciparum but its effect on post-treatment gametocyte circulation and
      infectiousness to mosquitoes has not been quantified. METHODS: In this
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 360 asymptomatic parasitaemic
      children aged 2-15 years were enrolled and assigned to receive:
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and a dose of placebo; AL and a 0.25 mg/kg
      primaquine dose; or AL and a 0.40 mg/kg primaquine dose. On days 0, 2, 3, 7, 10
      and 14, gametocytes were detected and quantified by microscopy, Pfs25 mRNA
      quantitative nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA), and
      quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). For a subset of participants,
      pre- and post-treatment infectiousness was assessed by mosquito feeding assays on
      days -1, 3, 7, 10 and 14. RESULTS: Both primaquine arms had lower gametocyte
      prevalences after day 3 compared to the placebo arm, regardless of gametocyte
      detection method. The mean (95% confidence interval) number of days to gametocyte
      clearance in children with patent gametocytes on day 0 (N = 150) was 19.7 (14.6 -
      24.8), 7.7 (6.3 - 9.1) and 8.2 (6.7 - 9.6) for the AL-placebo, the 0.25 mg/kg
      primaquine dose and the 0.40 mg/kg primaquine dose arms, respectively. While
      38.0% (30/79) of selected gametocytaemic individuals were infectious before
      treatment, only 1/251 participant, from the AL-placebo group, infected mosquitoes
      after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We observed similar gametocyte clearance rates
      after 0.25 and 0.40 mg/kg primaquine doses. Infectivity to mosquitoes after AL
      was very low and absent in primaquine arms. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV REGISTRATION:

AB  - Malaria remains a major public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo
      (DRC) with 14 million cases reported by the WHO Malaria Report in 2014.
      Asymptomatic malaria cases are known to be prevalent in endemic areas and are
      generally untreated, resulting in a significant source of gametocytes that may
      serve as reservoir of disease transmission. Considering that microscopy certainly
      underestimates the prevalence of Plasmodium infections within asymptomatic
      carriers and that PCR assays are currently recognized as the most sensitive
      methods for Plasmodium identification, this study was conducted to weigh the
      asymptomatic carriage in DRC by a molecular method. Six provinces were randomly
      selected for blood collection in which 80 to 100 individuals were included in the
      study. Five hundred and eighty blood samples were collected and molecular
      diagnosis was performed. Globally, almost half of the samples collected from
      asymptomatic individuals (280/580; 48.2%) had Plasmodium infections and the most 
      species identified was P. falciparum alone in combination with P. malariae. The
      high prevalence reported here should interpellate the bodies involved in malaria 
      control in DR Congo to take into account asymptomatic carriers in actions taken
      and consider asymptomatic malaria as a major hurdle for malaria elimination.

TI  - COMPARISON OF A GENUS-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONAL PCR AND A SPECIES-SPECIFIC NESTED-PCR
      FOR MALARIA DIAGNOSIS USING FTA COLLECTED SAMPLES FROM KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA.
PG  - 457-66
AB  - Molecular tools are increasingly accepted as the most sensitive and reliable
      techniques for malaria diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. Also, collection of
      finger prick blood spots onto filter papers is the most simple and affordable
      method for samples preservation and posterior molecular analysis, especially in
      rural endemic regions where malaria remains a major health problem. Two malaria
      molecular diagnostic tests, a Plasmodium genus-specific conventional PCR and a
      Plasmodium species-specific Nested PCR, were evaluated using DNA templates
      prepared from Whatman-FTA cards' dry blood spots using both,
      Methanol-fixation/Heat-extraction and FTA commercial purification kit. A total of
      121 blood samples were collected from six Saudi south-western endemic districts
      both, as thick and thin films for routine microscopic screening and onto FTA
      cards for molecular studies. Out of the 121 samples, 75 were P. falciparum
      positive by at least one technique. No other species of Plasmodium were detected.
      P. falciparum parasites were identified in 69/75 (92%) samples by microscopic
      screening in health care centers. P. genus-specific PCR was able to amplify P.
      falciparum DNA in 41/75 (55%) and 59/75 (79%) samples using
      Methanol-fixation/Heat-extraction and FTA purification kit, respectively. P.
      species-specific Nested PCR revealed 68/75 (91%) and 75/75 (100%) positive
      samples using DNA templates were isolated by Methanol-fixation/Heat- extraction
      and FTA purification methods, respectively. The species-specific Nested PCR
      applied to Whatman-FTA preserved and processed blood samples represents the best 
      alternative to classical microscopy for malaria diagnosis, particularly in
      epidemiological screening.

AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of
      the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective
      female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United
      States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria
      transmission. However, malaria is also occasionally acquired by persons who have 
      not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products,
      congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne
      transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify 
      episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for
      travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of 
      illness in 2013 and summarizes trends during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF
      SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or
      rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be reported to local and state health
      departments by health care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are
      conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to
      CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System, National Notifiable
      Diseases Surveillance System, or direct CDC consultations. CDC conducted
      antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted to CDC by 
      health care providers or local/state health departments. Data from these
      reporting systems serve as the basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received 1,727
      reported cases of malaria, including two congenital cases, with an onset of
      symptoms in 2013 among persons in the United States. The total number of cases
      represents a 2% increase from the 1,687 cases reported for 2012. Plasmodium
      falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in 61%, 14%, 3%, 
      and 4% of cases, respectively. Forty (2%) patients were infected by two species. 
      The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 17% of cases. Polymerase 
      chain reaction testing determined or corrected the species for 85 of the 137
      (62%) samples evaluated for drug resistance marker testing. Of the 904 patients
      who reported purpose of travel, 635 (70%) were visiting friends or relatives
      (VFR). Among the 961 cases in U.S. civilians for whom information on
      chemoprophylaxis use and travel region was known, 42 (4%) patients reported that 
      they had initiated and adhered to a chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by 
      CDC for the regions to which they had traveled. Thirty-six cases were reported in
      pregnant women, none of whom had adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported 
      cases, approximately 270 (16%) were classified as severe illnesses in 2013. Of
      these, 10 persons with malaria died in 2013, the highest number since 2001. In
      2013, a total of 137 blood samples submitted to CDC were tested for molecular
      markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance. Of the 100 P.
      falciparum-positive samples, 95 were tested for pyrimethamine resistance: 88
      (93%) had genetic polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 74
      (76%) with sulfadoxine resistance, 53 (53%) with chloroquine resistance, one (1%)
      with atovaquone resistance, none with mefloquine drug resistance, and none with
      artemisinin resistance. INTERPRETATION: The overall trend of malaria cases has
      been increasing since 1973; the number of cases reported in 2013 is the third
      highest annual total since then. Despite progress in reducing the global burden
      of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many regions, and the use of
      appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH
      ACTIONS: Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased
      slightly in 2013 compared with 2012, but still remains unacceptably low. This
      incomplete reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and
      prevent infections. VFRs continue to be a difficult population to reach with
      effective malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies
      that effectively target VFRs need to be developed and implemented to have a
      substantial impact on the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States.
      Fewer patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis in 2013 (32%) compared with 2012 
      (34%), and adherence was poor among those who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper
      use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will prevent the majority of malaria illness and 
      reduce the risk for severe disease
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be
      fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications
      appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of
      malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent
      molecular laboratory advances have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular 
      surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html). These advances will allow CDC to 
      track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both
      domestically and globally. For this to be successful, specimens should be
      submitted for all cases diagnosed in the United States. Clinicians should consult
      the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria and contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline
      for case management advice, when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations can be
      obtained online (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling
      the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713).

AB  - Malaria is one of the most common infective diseases in the world. Invasion of
      host erythrocytes by the malaria parasite is crucial for pathogen survival and
      pathogenesis. Various proteins mediate parasite invasion and identification of
      novel invasion-related proteins may aid in elucidating the underlying molecular
      mechanism and new intervention strategies for malaria control. This study
      characterized the PfTip protein, a homolog of the human Tcell immunomodulatory
      protein, and examined its function in preventing parasite infection.
      Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation were adopted in the present
      study. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PfTip has a betapropeller fold in its 
      structure and is highly expressed at the early ring stage. TNFRSF14 was predicted
      to be a candidate interactant of PfTip. Further analyses showed that PfTip
      blockage by sera inhibited erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite. The
      protective effect of PfTip was further confirmed through in vivo analysis. To the
      best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide evidence on the
      function of PfTip in erythrocyte parasite invasion. Additional assays involving
      the receptor of this protein are currently underway.

TI  - Reactive case-detection of malaria in Pailin Province, Western Cambodia: lessons 
      from a year-long evaluation in a pre-elimination setting.
PG  - 132
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1191-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As momentum towards malaria elimination grows, strategies are being
      developed for scale-up in elimination settings. One prominent strategy, reactive 
      case detection (RACD), involves screening and treating individuals living in
      close proximity to passively detected, or "index" cases. This study aims to use
      RACD to quantify Plasmodium parasitaemia in households of index cases, and
      identify risk factors for infection; these data could inform reactive screening
      approaches and identify target risk groups. METHODS: This study was conducted in 
      the Western Cambodian province of Pailin between May 2013 and March 2014 among
      440 households. Index participants/index cases (n = 270) and surrounding
      households (n = 110) were screened for Plasmodium infection with rapid diagnostic
      tests (RDT), microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Participants were interviewed to identify risk factors. A comparison group of 60 
      randomly-selected households was also screened, to compare infection levels of
      RACD and non-RACD households. In order to identify potential risk factors that
      would inform screening approaches and identify risk groups, multivariate logistic
      regression models were applied. RESULTS: Nine infections were identified in
      households of index cases (RACD approach) through RDT screening of 1898
      individuals (seven Plasmodium vivax, two Plasmodium falciparum); seven were
      afebrile. Seventeen infections were identified through PCR screening of 1596
      individuals (15 P. vivax, and 22 % P. falciparum/P. vivax mixed infections). In
      the control group, 25 P. falciparum infections were identified through PCR
      screening of 237 individuals, and no P. vivax was found. Plasmodium falciparum
      infection was associated with fever (p = 0.013), being a member of a control
      household (p </= 0.001), having a history of malaria infection (p = 0.041), and
      sleeping without a mosquito net (p = 0.011). Significant predictors of P. vivax
      infection, as diagnosed by PCR, were fever (p = 0.058, borderline significant)
      and history of malaria infection (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study found that
      RACD identified very few secondary infections when targeting index and
      neighbouring households for screening. The results suggest RACD is not
      appropriate, where exposure to malaria occurs away from the community, and there 
      is a high level of treatment-seeking from the private sector. Piloting RACD in a 
      range of transmission settings would help to identify the ideal environment for
      feasible and effective reactive screening methods.

PG  - 134

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of Plasmodium spp. is sometimes inconvenient especially in 
      rural areas that are distant from a laboratory. In this study a portable
      diagnostic test of Plasmodium spp. was developed using insulated isothermal
      polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) as an alternative approach to improve this
      situation. METHODS: A pair of universal primers and probe were designed to
      amplify and detect gene encoding 18S small sub-unit rRNA of Plasmodium spp using 
      iiPCR method in a portable device, POCKIT. The efficiency and detection limit of 
      the assay were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qPCR) approach before being subjected to testing in POCKIT. Detection results of
      POCKIT were displayed as '+', '-' or '?' based on the fluorescence ratio
      after/before reaction. A total of 55 and 35 samples from malaria patients and
      healthy subjects, respectively, were screened to evaluate the feasibility of this
      newly designed iiPCR assay. RESULTS: The iiPCR assay allowed the detection of
      various species of Plasmodium, including those infecting humans (Plasmodium
      falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, P. ovale), monkeys, birds, and
      rodents. Efficiency of the assay achieved 96.9 % while the lower detection limit 
      was >/=100 copies of plasmodial DNA. Specificity of the assay was assured as it
      could not detect human, bacterial and other parasitic DNA. Among the 55 clinical 
      samples tested, 47 (85.4 %) of them were detected as positive by POCKIT. Four
      (7.3 %) samples with fluorescence ratio after/before reaction of <1.2 were
      reported as negative while another four (7.3 %) were ambiguously detected as they
      had fluorescence ratios between 1.2 and 1.3. The fluorescence ratio was not found
      to be associated with the copy number of plasmodial DNA. This approach can only
      be considered as a qualitative method. CONCLUSIONS: The portable iiPCR system may
      serve as an alternative approach for preliminary screening of malaria in endemic 
      rural areas. The system may also be useful for detecting animal malaria in the
      field. Although it is not as quantitative as qPCR method, it is comparatively
      fast and easy to handle. It is believed that the POCKIT-iiPCR assay is able to
      achieve 100 % sensitivity if increased amount of DNA from each sample is used.
      The iiPCR assay can also be upgraded in future to detect multiple Plasmodium spp.
      at the same time by designing the specific primers and probes.

TI  - Human malaria diagnosis using a single-step direct-PCR based on the Plasmodium
      cytochrome oxidase III gene.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1185-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nested PCRs based on the Plasmodium 18s-rRNA gene have been
      extensively used for human malaria diagnosis. However, they are not practical
      when large quantities of samples need to be processed, further there have been
      challenges in the performance and when interpreting results, especially when
      submicroscopic infections are analysed. Here the use of "direct PCR" was
      investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis in the malaria elimination era. 
      METHODS: The performance of the Plasmodium cytochrome oxidase III gene (COX-III) 
      based novel malaria detection strategies (direct nested PCR and direct single
      PCR) were compared using a 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR as a reference tool.
      Evaluations were based on sensitivity, specificity and the ability to detect
      mixed infections using control blood spot samples and field collected blood
      samples with final species diagnosis confirmation by sequencing. RESULTS: The
      COX-III direct PCR (limit of detection: 0.6-2 parasites/muL) was more sensitive
      than the 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR (limit of detection: 2-10 parasites/muL). The
      COX-III direct PCR identified all 21 positive controls (no mixed infections
      detected) while the 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR identified 18/21 (including four
      mixed infections). Different concentrations of simulated mixed infections
      (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum) suggest that the COX-III direct PCR 
      detects only the predominant species. When the 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR was
      used to detect Plasmodium in field collected bloods spots (n = 3833), there was
      discrepancy in the results from the genus PCR (16 % positive) and the
      species-specific PCR (5 % positive). Further, a large portion of a subset of
      these positive samples (93 % for genus and 60 % for P. vivax), did not align with
      Plasmodium sequences. In contrast, the COX-III direct PCR clearly identified
      (single bands confirmed with sequencing) 2 % positive Plasmodium samples
      including P. vivax, P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale
      wallikeri. CONCLUSIONS: The COX-III single direct PCR is an alternative method
      for accurate detection of Plasmodium microscopic and submicroscopic infections in
      humans, especially when a large number of samples require screening. This PCR
      does not require DNA isolation, is sensitive, quick, produces confident/clear
      results, identifies all the Plasmodium species infecting humans, and is
      cost-effective.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Pyronaridine-Artesunate for Treatment of Uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in Western Cambodia.
PG  - 3884-90
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00039-16 [doi]
AB  - Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria was assessed in an area of artemisinin resistance in western
      Cambodia. This nonrandomized, single-arm, observational study was conducted
      between 2014 and 2015. Eligible patients were adults or children with
      microscopically confirmed P. falciparum infection and fever. Patients received
      pyronaridine-artesunate once daily for 3 days, dosed according to body weight.
      The primary outcome was an adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) 
      on day 42, estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, PCR adjusted to exclude
      reinfection. One hundred twenty-three patients were enrolled. Day 42 PCR-crude
      ACPRs were 87.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.7 to 92.6%) for the overall
      study, 89.8% (95% CI, 78.8 to 95.3%) for Pursat, and 82.1% (95% CI, 68.4 to
      90.2%) for Pailin. Day 42 PCR-adjusted ACPRs were 87.9% (95% CI, 80.6 to 93.2%)
      for the overall study, 89.8% (95% CI, 78.8 to 95.3%) for Pursat, and 84.0% (95%
      CI, 70.6 to 91.7%) for Pailin (P = 0.353 by a log rank test). Day 28 PCR-crude
      and -adjusted ACPRs were 93.2% (95% CI, 82.9 to 97.4%) and 88.1% (95% CI, 75.3 to
      94.5%) for Pursat and Pailin, respectively. A significantly lower proportion of
      patients achieved day 3 parasite clearance in Pailin (56.4% [95% CI, 43.9 to
      69.6%]) than in Pursat (86.7% [95% CI, 76.8 to 93.8%]; P = 0.0019). Fever
      clearance was also extended at Pailin versus Pursat (P < 0.0001). Most patients
      (95.9% [116/121]) harbored P. falciparum kelch13 C580Y mutant parasites.
      Pyronaridine-artesunate was well tolerated; mild increases in hepatic
      transaminase levels were consistent with data from previous reports.
      Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy was below the World Health
      Organization-recommended threshold at day 42 for medicines with a long half-life 
      (90%) for first-line treatment of P. falciparum malaria in western Cambodia
      despite high efficacy elsewhere in Asia and Africa. (This study has been
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT02389439.).

AB  - PCR is the most sensitive molecular diagnostic available for infectious diseases.
      The goal for low-resource settings is a simple, inexpensive instrument. Toward
      this goal, we previously published a self-contained sample preparation instrument
      that uses magnetics and prearrayed reagents in thin tubing to extract nucleic
      acids and perform isothermal amplification and detection of extracted biomarkers.
      To incorporate PCR thermal cycling, after biomarker is magnetically extracted
      from a patient sample, the section of tubing containing the extracted biomarker
      and PCR reagents is alternately positioned within two constant temperature
      blocks. This instrument was evaluated initially by extracting and amplifying a
      140 bp fragment of the IS6110 sequence of tuberculosis from TE buffer. The mean
      cycle threshold for 5 x 10(6) copies of IS6110 was 25.5 +/- 1.5 cycles (n = 4),
      which was significantly different from negative control samples (34.0 +/- 2.6
      cycles; n = 3). Using a more clinically relevant sample, we extracted and
      amplified Plasmodium falciparum DNA from malaria-infected human blood cultures.
      The average cycle threshold for 1% parasitemia samples was 24.7 +/- 1.5 cycles (n
      = 3) and significantly different from negatives (31.5 +/- 2.1 cycles; n = 3).
      This approach integrates biomarker extraction, PCR amplification, and detection
      in a simple, linear tubing design with potential for use as a low-resource
      instrument.

TI  - Anopheles subpictus carry human malaria parasites in an urban area of Western
      India and may facilitate perennial malaria transmission.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1177-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: India contributes 1.5-2 million annual confirmed cases of malaria.
      Since both parasites and vectors are evolving rapidly, updated information on
      parasite prevalence in mosquitoes is important for vector management and disease 
      control. Possible new vector-parasite interactions in Goa, India were tested.
      METHODS: A total of 1036 CDC traps were placed at four malaria endemic foci in
      Goa, India from May 2013 to April 2015. These captured 23,782 mosquitoes, of
      which there were 1375 female anopheline specimens with ten species identified
      using morphological keys. Mosquito DNA was analysed for human and bovine blood as
      well as for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection. RESULTS: Human 
      host feeding was confirmed in Anopheles stephensi (30 %), Anopheles subpictus (27
      %), Anopheles jamesii (22 %), Anopheles annularis (26 %), and Anopheles
      nigerrimus (16 %). In contrast, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles barbirostris,
      Anopheles tessellates, Anopheles umbrosus and Anopheles karwari specimens were
      negative for human blood. Importantly, An. subpictus, which was considered a
      non-vector in Goa and Western India, was found to be a dominant vector in terms
      of both total number of mosquitoes collected as well as Plasmodium carriage.
      Plasmodium infections were detected in 14 An. subpictus (2.8 %), while the
      traditional vector, An. stephensi, showed seven total infections, two of which
      were in the salivary glands. Of the 14 An. subpictus infections, nested PCR
      demonstrated three Plasmodium infections in the salivary glands: one P. vivax and
      two mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, ten gut
      infections (one P. vivax, six P. falciparum and three mixed infections) were seen
      in An. subpictus. Longitudinal mosquito collections pointed to a bimodal annual
      appearance of An. subpictus to maintain a perennial malaria transmission cycle of
      both P. vivax and P. falciparum in Goa.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum ookinete expression of plasmepsin VII and plasmepsin X.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1161-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium invasion of the mosquito midgut is a population bottleneck
      in the parasite lifecycle. Interference with molecular mechanisms by which the
      ookinete invades the mosquito midgut is one potential approach to developing
      malaria transmission-blocking strategies. Plasmodium aspartic proteases are one
      such class of potential targets: plasmepsin IV (known to be present in the
      asexual stage food vacuole) was previously shown to be involved in Plasmodium
      gallinaceum infection of the mosquito midgut, and plasmepsins VII and plasmepsin 
      X (not known to be present in the asexual stage food vacuole) are upregulated in 
      Plasmodium falciparum mosquito stages. These (and other) parasite-derived enzymes
      that play essential roles during ookinete midgut invasion are prime candidates
      for transmission-blocking vaccines. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
      was used to determine timing of P. falciparum plasmepsin VII (PfPM VII) and
      plasmepsin X (PfPM X) mRNA transcripts in parasite mosquito midgut stages.
      Protein expression was confirmed by western immunoblot and immunofluorescence
      assays (IFA) using anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immunogenic 
      regions of PfPM VII and PfPM X. These antibodies were also used in standard
      membrane feeding assays (SMFA) to determine whether inhibition of these proteases
      would affect parasite transmission to mosquitoes. The Mann-Whitney U test was
      used to analyse mosquito transmission assay results. RESULTS: RT-PCR, western
      immunoblot and immunofluorescence assay confirmed expression of PfPM VII and PfPM
      X in mosquito stages. Whereas PfPM VII was expressed in zygotes and ookinetes,
      PfPM X was expressed in gametes, zygotes, and ookinetes. Antibodies against PfPM 
      VII and PfPM X decreased P. falciparum invasion of the mosquito midgut when used 
      at high concentrations, indicating that these proteases play a role in Plasmodium
      mosquito midgut invasion. Failure to generate genetic knockouts of these genes
      limited determination of the precise role of these proteases in parasite
      transmission but suggests that they are essential during the intraerythrocytic
      life cycle. CONCLUSIONS: PfPM VII and PfPM X are present in the
      mosquito-infective stages of P. falciparum. Standard membrane feeding assays
      demonstrate that antibodies against these proteins reduce the infectivity of P.
      falciparum for mosquitoes, suggesting their viability as transmission-blocking
      vaccine candidates. Further study of the role of these plasmepsins in P.
      falciparum biology is warranted.

      in Myanmar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy has been first-line treatment
      for falciparum malaria in Myanmar since 2005. The wide extent of artemisinin
      resistance in the Greater Mekong sub-region and the presence of mefloquine
      resistance at the Myanmar-Thailand border raise concerns over resistance patterns
      in Myanmar. The availability of molecular markers for resistance to both drugs
      enables assessment even in remote malaria-endemic areas. METHODS: A total of 250 
      dried blood spot samples collected from patients with Plasmodium falciparum
      malarial infection in five malaria-endemic areas across Myanmar were analysed for
      kelch 13 sequence (k13) and pfmdr1 copy number variation. K13 mutations in the
      region corresponding to amino acids 210-726 (including the propeller region of
      the protein) were detected by nested PCR amplification and sequencing, and pfmdr1
      copy number variation by real-time PCR. In two sites, a sub-set of patients were 
      prospectively followed up for assessment of day-3 parasite clearance rates after 
      a standard course of artemether-lumefantrine. RESULTS: K13 mutations and pfmdr1
      amplification were successfully analysed in 206 and 218 samples, respectively.
      Sixty-nine isolates (33.5 %) had mutations within the k13 propeller region with
      53 of these (76.8 %) having mutations already known to be associated with
      artemisinin resistance. F446I (32 isolates) and P574L (15 isolates) were the most
      common examples. K13 mutation was less common in sites in western border regions 
      (29 of 155 isolates) compared to samples from the east and north (40 of 51
      isolates; p < 0.0001). The overall proportion of parasites with multiple pfmdr1
      copies (greater than 1.5) was 5.5 %. Seven samples showed both k13 mutation and
      multiple copies of pfmdr1. Only one of 36 patients followed up after
      artemether-lumefantrine treatment still had parasites at day 3; molecular
      analysis indicated wild-type k13 and single copy pfmdr1. CONCLUSION: The
      proportion of P. falciparum isolates with mutations in the propeller region of
      k13 indicates that artemisinin resistance extends across much of Myanmar. There
      is a low prevalence of parasites with multiple pfmdr1 copies across the country. 
      The efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy containing mefloquine and
      lumefantrine is, therefore, expected to be high, although regular monitoring of
      efficacy will be important.

TI  - A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Randomized Study of Arterolane Maleate-Piperaquine
      Phosphate vs Artemether-Lumefantrine for Falciparum Malaria in Adolescent and
      Adult Patients in Asia and Africa.
PG  - 964-971

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinins, which are derived from plants, are subject to risk of
      supply interruption due to climatic changes. Consequently, an effort to identify 
      a new synthetic antimalarial was initiated. A fixed-dose combination of
      arterolane maleate (AM), a new synthetic trioxolane, with piperaquine phosphate
      (PQP), a long half-life bisquinoline, was evaluated in patients with
      uncomplicatedPlasmodium falciparummalaria. METHODS: In this multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, comparative, parallel-group trial, 1072 patients aged
      12-65 years withP. falciparummonoinfection received either AM-PQP (714 patients) 
      once daily or artemether-lumefantrine (A-L; 358 patients) twice daily for 3 days.
      All patients were followed up until day 42. RESULTS: Of the 714 patients in the
      AM-PQP group, 638 (89.4%) completed the study; of the 358 patients in the A-L
      group, 301(84.1%) completed the study. In both groups, the polymerase chain
      reaction corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (PCR-corrected 
      ACPR) on day 28 in intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations was
      92.86% and 92.46% and 99.25% and 99.07%, respectively. The corresponding figures 
      on day 42 in the ITT and PP populations were 90.48% and 91.34%, respectively.
      After adjusting for survival ITT, the PCR-corrected ACPR on day 42 was >98% in
      both groups. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable. CONCLUSIONS:
      AM-PQP showed comparable efficacy and safety to A-L in the treatment of
      uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria in adolescent and adult patients. AM-PQP
      demonstrated high clinical and parasitological response rates as well as rapid
      parasite clearance. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: India. CTRI/2009/091/000101.

TI  - Demonstration of the Blood-Stage Plasmodium falciparum Controlled Human Malaria
      Infection Model to Assess Efficacy of the P. falciparum Apical Membrane Antigen 1
      Vaccine, FMP2.1/AS01.
PG  - 1743-51
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Models of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) initiated by
      mosquito bite have been widely used to assess efficacy of preerythrocytic vaccine
      candidates in small proof-of-concept phase 2a clinical trials. Efficacy testing
      of blood-stage malaria parasite vaccines, however, has generally relied on
      larger-scale phase 2b field trials in malaria-endemic populations. We report the 
      use of a blood-stage P. falciparum CHMI model to assess blood-stage vaccine
      candidates, using their impact on the parasite multiplication rate (PMR) as the
      primary efficacy end point. METHODS: Fifteen healthy United Kingdom adult
      volunteers were vaccinated with FMP2.1, a protein vaccine that is based on the
      3D7 clone sequence of apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and formulated in Adjuvant
      System 01 (AS01). Twelve vaccinees and 15 infectivity controls subsequently
      underwent blood-stage CHMI. Parasitemia was monitored by quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and PMR was modeled from these data.
      RESULTS: FMP2.1/AS01 elicited anti-AMA1 T-cell and serum antibody responses.
      Analysis of purified immunoglobulin G showed functional growth inhibitory
      activity against P. falciparum in vitro. There were no vaccine- or CHMI-related
      safety concerns. All volunteers developed blood-stage parasitemia, with no impact
      of the vaccine on PMR. CONCLUSIONS: FMP2.1/AS01 demonstrated no efficacy after
      blood-stage CHMI. However, the model induced highly reproducible infection in all
      volunteers and will accelerate proof-of-concept testing of future blood-stage
      vaccine candidates. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02044198.

TI  - An external sensing system in Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1144-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of experiments have previously indicated that Plasmodium
      falciparum-infected erythrocytes (pRBC) were able to sense host environment. The 
      basis of this ability to detect external cues is not known but in screening
      signalling molecules from pRBC using commercial antibodies, a 34 kDa
      phosphorylated molecule that possesses such ability was identified. METHODS: The 
      pRBC were exposed to different culture conditions and proteins were extracted for
      1D or 2D gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot. The localization of 34 kDa
      protein was examined by biochemical fractionation followed by Western blot.
      High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of immune precipitants was used to
      identify this protein and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction was used for detecting mRNA expression level. RESULTS: The 34 kDa 
      protein was called PfAB4 has immediate responses (dephosphorylation and rapid
      turnover) to host environmental stimuli such as serum depletion, osmolality
      change and cytokine addition. PfAB4 is expressed constitutively throughout the
      erythrocytic lifecycle with dominant expression in trophozoites 30 h
      post-infection. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment induced a transient
      detectable dephosphorylation of PfAB4 in the ItG strain (2 min after addition)
      and the level of expression and phosphorylation returned to normal within 1-2 h. 
      PfAB4 localized dominantly in pRBC cytoplasm, with a transient shift to the
      nucleus under TNF stimulation as shown by biochemical fractionation.
      High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of immune precipitants of AB4
      antibodies revealed a 34 kDa PfAB4 component as a mixture of proliferating
      cellular nuclear antigen-1 (PCNA1) and exported protein-2 (EXP2), along with a
      small number of other inconsistently identified peptides. Different parasite
      strains have different PfAB4 expression levels, but no significant association
      between mRNA and PfAB4 levels was seen, indicating that the differences may be at
      the post-transcriptional, presumably phosphorylation, level. A triple serine
      phosphorylated PCNA1 peptide was identified from the PfAB4 high expression strain
      only, providing further evidence that the identity of PfAB4 is PCNA1 in P.
      falciparum. CONCLUSION: A protein element in the human malaria parasite that
      responds to external cues, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF have been 
      discovered. Treatment results in a transient change in phosphorylation status of 
      the response element, which also migrates from the parasite cytoplasm to the
      nucleus. The response element has been identified as PfPCNA1. This sensing
      response could be regulated by a parasite checkpoint system and be analogous to
      bacterial two-component signal transduction systems.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein-2 diversity and the implications for
      PfHRP 2: based malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Ghana.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1159-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a key role in malaria
      management and control. The PfHRP-2 based RDT is the most widely used RDT for
      malaria diagnosis in Ghana. Deletion of pfhrp2 in Plasmodium falciparum parasites
      affect the diagnostic accuracy of PfHRP-2 based RDT kits. Identifying the
      prevalence and distribution of P. falciparum parasites with deleted pfhrp2 is
      important for malaria control. AIM: The purpose of this study was to identify and
      confirm the prevalence of pfhrp2 deletant P. falciparum parasites circulating
      within different regions of Ghana. METHODS: DNA was extracted from the membrane
      of spent CareStart PfHRP-2 RDT kits and dried filter paper blood blots using
      Chelex-100. Exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes were amplified by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR), resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV
      light. RESULTS: Microscopic analysis of blood smears from samples that were
      PfHRP-2 RDT positive revealed a parasite prevalence of 54/114 (47.4 %) and 2/26
      (7.7 %) in Accra and Cape Coast, respectively. PCR analysis increased parasite
      prevalence in the RDT positive samples to 94/114 (82.5 %) and 6/26 (23.1 %) in
      Accra and Cape Coast respectively. The exon 2 of the pfhrp2 gene was deleted in
      18/54 (33.3 %) of the microscopy confirmed and 36.2 % (34/94) of the PCR
      confirmed RDT positive samples collected in Accra. No RDT sample, confirmed to
      contain parasites by either PCR or microscopy was negative by pfhrp2 exon 2 PCR
      in Cape Coast. A survey of an additional 558 DBS revealed that 22.4 % (46/205)
      and 40 % (44/110) of PCR positive samples in Accra and Cape Coast, respectively, 
      lacked the exon 2 region of pfhrp2 and possibly the entire pfhrp2 gene.
      CONCLUSIONS: A high number of P. falciparum parasites, which lack pfhrp2 exon 2
      gene have been identified in two communities in Ghana. Continuous nationwide
      monitoring of the prevalence of pfhrp2 deletant parasites would be essential to
      malaria control. The use of RDT kits that are effective at malaria diagnosis
      despite deletion of pfhrp2, such as the PfHRP-2/PfLDH combo RDT kit could enhance
      the diagnosis of clinical malaria in Ghana.

TI  - In Vivo Efficacy of Artesunate/Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine versus
      Artesunate/Amodiaquine in the Treatment of Uncomplicated P. falciparium Malaria
      in Children around the Slope of Mount Cameroon: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - E5 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines4010005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development and spread of antimalarial drug resistant parasites
      contributes to the global impact of the disease. In vivo efficacy assessments of 
      treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria are essential for ensuring effective
      case management. Artemisinin-based combinations have been adopted as the
      first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Cameroon since
      2004. METHODS: A total of 177 children aged six-months to 10 years with
      uncomplicated mono-infected falciparum malaria were randomized (1:1) to receive
      artesunate/sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS/SP) or artesunate/amodiaquine (AS/AQ)
      pediatric tablets and followed up for 28 days according to the standard World
      Health Organization in vivo drug efficacy monitoring protocol. The primary and
      secondary endpoints were PCR uncorrected and corrected cure rates, as measured by
      adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28. RESULTS: The PCR
      corrected cure rate was high, overall (88.1%, 95% CI 83.1-93.1), 85.9% (95% CI
      78.2-93.6), and 90.2% (95% CI 83.8-96.6) for AS/SP and AS/AQ, respectively.
      Twenty-one treatment failures were observed during follow-up, constituting one
      (4.6%), 14 (8.2%), and six (3.5%) early treatment failure (ETF), late clinical
      failure (LCF), and late parasitological failure (LPF), respectively. The drugs
      were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Both AS/SP and
      AS/AQ are highly effective and well-tolerated treatments for uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria around the slope of Mount Cameroon.

TI  - Sensitive Detection of Plasmodium vivax Using a High-Throughput, Colourimetric
      Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (HtLAMP) Platform: A Potential Novel Tool 
      for Malaria Elimination.
PG  - e0004443
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004443 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Plasmodium vivax malaria has a wide geographic distribution and
      poses challenges to malaria elimination that are likely to be greater than those 
      of P. falciparum. Diagnostic tools for P. vivax infection in non-reference
      laboratory settings are limited to microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests but
      these are unreliable at low parasitemia. The development and validation of a
      high-throughput and sensitive assay for P. vivax is a priority. METHODS: A
      high-throughput LAMP assay targeting a P. vivax mitochondrial gene and deploying 
      colorimetric detection in a 96-well plate format was developed and evaluated in
      the laboratory. Diagnostic accuracy was compared against microscopy, antigen
      detection tests and PCR and validated in samples from malaria patients and
      community controls in a district hospital setting in Sabah, Malaysia. RESULTS:
      The high throughput LAMP-P. vivax assay (HtLAMP-Pv) performed with an estimated
      limit of detection of 1.4 parasites/ muL. Assay primers demonstrated
      cross-reactivity with P. knowlesi but not with other Plasmodium spp. Field
      testing of HtLAMP-Pv was conducted using 149 samples from symptomatic malaria
      patients (64 P. vivax, 17 P. falciparum, 56 P. knowlesi, 7 P. malariae, 1 mixed
      P. knowlesi/P. vivax, with 4 excluded). When compared against multiplex PCR,
      HtLAMP-Pv demonstrated a sensitivity for P. vivax of 95% (95% CI 87-99%); 61/64),
      and specificity of 100% (95% CI 86-100%); 25/25) when P. knowlesi samples were
      excluded. HtLAMP-Pv testing of 112 samples from asymptomatic community controls, 
      7 of which had submicroscopic P. vivax infections by PCR, showed a sensitivity of
      71% (95% CI 29-96%; 5/7) and specificity of 93% (95% CI87-97%; 98/105).
      CONCLUSION: This novel HtLAMP-P. vivax assay has the potential to be a useful
      field applicable molecular diagnostic test for P. vivax infection in elimination 
      settings.

TI  - Protein profiling of mefloquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum using mass
      spectrometry-based proteomics.
PG  - 82-92
AB  - Malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease caused by protozoa of genus
      Plasmodium. There are five species of Plasmodium that are found to infect humans.
      Plasmodium falciparum can cause severe malaria leading to higher morbidity and
      mortality of malaria than the other four species. Antimalarial resistance is the 
      major obstacle to control malaria. Mefloquine was used in combination with
      Artesunate for uncomplicated P. falciparum in South East Asia and it has
      developed and established mefloquine resistance in this region. Here,
      gel-enhanced liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS)-based
      proteomics and label-free quantification were used to explore the protein
      profiles of mefloquine-sensitive and -induced resistant P. falciparum. A Thai P. 
      falciparum isolate (S066) was used as a model in this research. Our data revealed
      for the first time that 69 proteins exhibited at least 2-fold differences in
      their expression levels between the two parasite lines. Of these, 36 were
      up-regulated and 33 were down-regulated in the mefloquine-resistant line compared
      with the mefloquine-sensitive line. These findings are consistent with those of
      past studies, where the multidrug resistance protein Pgh1 showed an up-regulation
      pattern consistent with that expected from its average 3-copy pfmdr1 gene number.
      Pgh1 and eight other up-regulated proteins (i.e., histo-aspartyl protease
      protein, exportin 1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 8,
      peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, serine rich protein homologue, exported
      protein 1, ATP synthase beta chain and phospholipid scramblase 1) were further
      validated for their expression levels using reverse transcriptase quantitative
      real-time PCR. The data support the up-regulation status in the
      mefloquine-resistant parasite line of all the candidate genes referred to above. 
      Therefore, GeLC-MS/MS-based proteomics combined with label-free quantification is
      a reliable approach for exploring mefloquine resistance biomarkers in P.
      falciparum. Identification of these proteins leads to better understanding of
      mefloquine resistant mechanisms in malaria parasites.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF MALARIA INFECTION AT TWO BORDER AREAS OF THAILAND ADJOINING
      WITH MYANMAR AND MALAYSIA.
PG  - 551-7
AB  - During 2009 to 2010, a total of 408 blood samples collected from malaria patients
      in Ranong (149) and Yala (259) Provinces, Thailand were investigated for
      Plasmodium spp using microscopic examination. There are no statistical
      differences in the prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax in samples collected 
      from Ranong and Yala (46% vs 52%, and 54% vs 45%, respectively). Single
      nucleotide polymorphism of codon 86 in pfmdr1 (encoding P. falciparum multidrug
      resistance protein 1) was investigated among 75 samples of P. falciparum and 2
      samples of P. knowlesi. A pfmdr1 N86Y mutation was detected in 1 out of 29
      samples and 45 out of 46 samples obtained from Ranong and Yala Provinces,
      respectively. It is interesting that pfmdr1 was detected in two P. knowlesi DNA
      samples obtained previously from Ranong Province which was 99% homologous to
      pfmdr1 obtained from falciparum parasites in the same area but the mutation was
      not observed. The difference in multidrug resistance protein in Plasmodium
      obtained from those two border areas of Thailand will be of use in monitoring
      drug resistance in these border regions of the country.

TI  - Widespread distribution of Plasmodium vivax malaria in Mauritania on the
      interface of the Maghreb and West Africa.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1118-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is very rarely seen in West Africa, although
      specific detection methods are not widely applied in the region, and it is now
      considered to be absent from North Africa. However, this parasite species has
      recently been reported to account for most malaria cases in Nouakchott, the
      capital of Mauritania, which is a large country at the interface of sub-Saharan
      West Africa and the Maghreb region in northwest Africa. METHODS: To determine the
      distribution of malaria parasite species throughout Mauritania, malaria cases
      were sampled in 2012 and 2013 from health facilities in 12 different areas. These
      sampling sites were located in eight major administrative regions of the country,
      within different parts of the Sahara and Sahel zones. Blood spots from
      finger-prick samples of malaria cases were processed to identify parasite DNA by 
      species-specific PCR. RESULTS: Out of 472 malaria cases examined, 163 (34.5 %)
      had P. vivax alone, 296 (62.7 %) Plasmodium falciparum alone, and 13 (2.8 %) had 
      mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infection. All cases were negative for
      Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. The parasite species distribution
      showed a broad spectrum, P. vivax being detected at six of the different sites,
      in five of the country's major administrative regions (Tiris Zemmour, Tagant,
      Brakna, Assaba, and the capital Nouakchott). Most cases in Nouakchott were due to
      P. vivax, although proportions vary significantly among different health
      facilities in the city. In the northern town of Zouerat, all cases were due to P.
      vivax, whereas almost all cases in the south of the country were due to P.
      falciparum. All P. vivax cases tested were Duffy blood group positive.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is important that P. vivax is recognized to be a widespread cause
      of malaria in Mauritania, occurring in diverse regions. This should be noted by
      the World Health Organization, as it has significant implications for diagnosis, 
      treatment and control of malaria in the northwestern part of Africa.

TI  - Variation in susceptibility of African Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites to
      TEP1 mediated killing in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.
PG  - 20440
LID - 10.1038/srep20440 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles gambiae s.s. mosquitoes are efficient vectors for Plasmodium
      falciparum, although variation exists in their susceptibility to infection. This 
      variation depends partly on the thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) and TEP
      depletion results in significantly elevated numbers of oocysts in susceptible and
      resistant mosquitoes. Polymorphism in the Plasmodium gene coding for the surface 
      protein Pfs47 modulates resistance of some parasite laboratory strains to
      TEP1-mediated killing. Here, we examined resistance of P. falciparum isolates of 
      African origin (NF54, NF165 and NF166) to TEP1-mediated killing in a susceptible 
      Ngousso and a refractory L3-5 strain of A. gambiae. All parasite clones
      successfully developed in susceptible mosquitoes with limited evidence for an
      impact of TEP1 on transmission efficiency. In contrast, NF166 and NF165 oocyst
      densities were strongly reduced in refractory mosquitoes and TEP1 silencing
      significantly increased oocyst densities. Our results reveal differences between 
      African P. falciparum strains in their capacity to evade TEP1-mediated killing in
      resistant mosquitoes. There was no significant correlation between Pfs47 genotype
      and resistance of a given P. falciparum isolate for TEP1 killing. These data
      suggest that polymorphisms in this locus are not the sole mediators of immune
      evasion of African malaria parasites.

AB  - Contraceptive vaccines have been used for the management of wildlife population. 
      In the present study, we have examined the contraceptive potential of Escherichia
      coli-expressed recombinant fusion protein comprising of 'promiscuous' T cell
      epitope of tetanus toxoid [TT; amino acid (aa) residues 830-844] followed by
      dilysine linker (KK), dog ZP3 fragment (aa residues 307-346), triglycine spacer
      (GGG), T cell epitope of bovine RNase (bRNase; aa residues 94-104), GnRH, T cell 
      epitope of circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum (CSP; aa residues
      362-383), and GnRH. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified refolded protein revealed a
      dominant approximately 12 kDa band, which in Western blot reacted with mouse
      polyclonal antibodies against dog ZP3 fragment and mouse monoclonal antibodies
      against GnRH. Immunization of female FvB/J mice following two booster schedule
      with the above recombinant protein supplemented with alum led to high antibody
      titres against the immunogen as well as ZP3 and GnRH as determined by ELISA. The 
      immune sera reacted with zona pellucida of mouse oocyte and also inhibited
      in-vitro fertilization. The qRT-PCR studies showed decrease in the ovarian GnRH
      receptor in mice immunized with the recombinant fusion protein. Mating studies
      revealed high contraceptive efficacy of the recombinant protein as in two
      independent experiments, 90% of the immunized female mice failed to conceive.
      Following one booster immunization schedule, 50% of the immunized female mice
      failed to conceive. However, in adjuvanted controls, all the female mice became
      pregnant. To conclude, the recombinant protein described herein has a good
      potential to be developed as candidate contraceptive vaccine.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Surface Protein-1 Polymorphisms among
      Asymptomatic Sickle Cell Anemia Patients in Nigeria.
PG  - 44-53
AB  - Asymptomatic malaria (ASM) has been implicated in the development of hemolytic
      crisis in infected sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients worldwide. This study
      surveyed steady state SCA Nigerian patients for ASM to investigate the influence 
      of malaria prevention behaviors and age on parasitaemia and multiplicity of
      infection (MOI). A total of 78 steady SCA patients aged 5 - 27 years on routine
      care at three health facilities in Lagos were investigated for ASM by light
      microscopy and PCR with a multiplicity of infection determined by genotyping
      block 2 of merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) gene of Plasmodium falciparum (P.
      falciparum). Use of malaria prevention measures was captured using a
      semi-structured questionnaire. The prevalence rates of ASM (due to Pf only) by
      microscopy and PCR were found to be 27.3% and 47.4% respectively (P < 0.05) with 
      a Mean + SEM parasite density of 2238.4 + 464.3 parasites/uL. Five distinct msp1 
      genotypes [K1 (2), MAD20 (2), RO33 (1)] were detected and significant (P<0.05)
      disparity in allele frequencies (K1, 91.8%, MAD20, 32.4%; RO33, 18.9%) was found.
      The overall MOI was 1.43 and 37.8% of infections were polyclonal (P<0.05). ASM
      was associated with non-use of preventive measures and occurred in 62.1% of SCA
      patients aged < 10y with lower MOI of 1.3 compared to 38.1% in older patients
      with a higher MOI of 1.5 (P<0.05). We conclude that PCR improved the diagnosis of
      ASM among Nigerian SCA patients with infections being of low complexity and
      associated with non-use of preventive interventions and R033 msp1 allele
      selection.

TI  - What is the value of reactive case detection in malaria control? A case-study in 
      India and a systematic review.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1120-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactive case detection (RCD) for malaria is a strategy to identify
      additional malaria infections in areas of low malaria transmission and can
      complement passive surveillance. This study describes experiences with RCD in two
      Indian sites, and aimed to synthesize experiences with RCD across endemic
      countries. METHODS: RCD programmes were piloted in two urban areas of India with 
      a low prevalence of mainly Plasmodium vivax malaria in 2014. Cases were
      identified in a clinic by microscopy and contacts were screened within 2 weeks;
      PCR, in addition to microscopy, was used to detect Plasmodium parasites. A
      systematic review was conducted to identify RCD experiences in the literature.
      RESULTS: In Chennai, 868 contacts were enrolled for 18 index cases of clinical
      malaria; in Nadiad, 131 contacts were enrolled for 20 index cases. No new malaria
      infections were detected in Nadiad among contacts, and four new infections were
      detected in Chennai (three P. vivax and one Plasmodium falciparum), of which two 
      were among household members of index cases. An additional five studies
      describing results from an RCD strategy were identified in the literature: four
      in Africa and one in Thailand. Including the results from India, the average
      number of contacts screened per index case in a total of seven studies ranged
      from four to 50, and 126 in a case study in Thailand with one index case. Malaria
      was detected in 0-45 % of the contacted persons. The average number of index
      cases needed to be traced to find one new case of malaria ranged from one to
      five, and could not be assessed in one study in India (no contacts positive for
      20 cases). Sharing the household with an index case was associated with a
      five-fold increased risk of malaria compared to contacts from households without 
      an index case (pooled risk ratio 5.29, 95 % CI 3.31-8.47, I(2) 0 %, four
      studies). CONCLUSIONS: RCD in areas of low malaria transmission is a
      labour-intensive strategy, and its benefit is not clear. Studies are needed to
      assess how RCD can be optimized or into alternatives where interventions are
      targeted to family members or hotspots.

TI  - Mutations of pvdhfr and pvdhps genes in vivax endemic-malaria areas in Kota
      Marudu and Kalabakan, Sabah.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1109-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria cases persist in some remote areas in Sabah and Sarawak
      despite the ongoing and largely successful malaria control programme conducted by
      the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, Ministry Of Health, Malaysia. Point
      mutations in the genes that encode the two enzymes involved in the folate
      biosynthesis pathway, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase
      (DHPS) enzymes confer resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine respectively,
      in both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. The aim of the current study was to
      determine the mutation on both pvdhfr at codon 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and 173
      and pvdhps genes at codon 383 and 553, which are potentially associated with
      resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine in P. vivax samples in Sabah.
      METHODS: Every individual was screened for presence of malaria infection using a 
      commercial rapid dipstick assay, ParaMax-3 (Zephyr Biomedical, India).
      Individuals tested positive for P. vivax had blood collected and parasite DNA
      extracted. The pvdhfr and pvdhps genes were amplified by nested-PCR. Restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was carried out for detection of specific
      mutations in pvdhfr at codons 13Leu, 33Leu, 57Ile/Leu, 58Arg, 61Met, 117Asn/Thr, 
      and 173Leu and pvdhps at codons 383Gly and 553Gly. The PCR-RFLP products were
      analysed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technology, AS). RESULTS: A 
      total of 619 and 2119 individuals from Kalabakan and Kota Marudu, respectively
      participated in the study. In Kalabakan and Kota Marudu, 9.37 and 2.45 % were
      tested positive for malaria and the positivity for P. vivax infection was 4.2 and
      0.52 %, respectively. No mutation was observed at codon 13, 33 and 173 on pvdhfr 
      and at codon 553 on pvdhps gene on samples from Kalabakan and Kota Marudu.
      One-hundred per cent mutations on pvdhfr were at 57Leu and 117Thr. Mutation at
      58Arg and 61Met was observed to be higher in Kota Marudu 72.73 %. Mutation at
      383Gly on pvdhps was highest in Kalabakan with 80.77 %. There are four distinct
      haplotypes of pvdhfr/pvdhps combination. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of triple and 
      quintuple mutation combination suggest that the P. vivax isolates exhibit a high 
      degree of resistant to sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      combination therapy.

TI  - Genetic diversity and natural selection in the rhoptry-associated protein 1
      (RAP-1) of recent Plasmodium knowlesi clinical isolates from Malaysia.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1127-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP-1) plays a role in
      the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole following the parasite's invasion of
      red blood cells. Although there is some evidence that the protein is recognized
      by the host's immune system, study of Plasmodium falciparum RAP-1 (PfRAP-1)
      suggests that it is not under immune pressure. A previous study on five old
      (1953-1962) P. knowlesi strains suggested that RAP-1 has limited genetic
      polymorphism and might be under negative selection. In the present study, 30
      recent P. knowlesi isolates were studied to obtain a better insight into the
      polymorphism and natural selection of PkRAP-1. METHODS: Blood samples from 30
      knowlesi malaria patients were used. These samples were collected between 2010
      and 2014. The PkRAP-1 gene, which contains two exons, was amplified by PCR,
      cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic
      analyses were performed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programs. RESULTS:
      Thirty PkRAP-1 sequences were obtained. The nucleotide diversity (pi) of exons 1,
      2 and the total coding region (0.00915, 0.01353 and 0.01298, respectively) were
      higher than those of the old strains. Further analysis revealed a lower rate of
      non-synonymous (dN) than synonymous (dS) mutations, suggesting negative
      (purifying) selection of PkRAP-1. Tajima's D test and Fu and Li's D test values
      were not significant. At the amino acid level, 22 haplotypes were established
      with haplotype H7 having the highest frequency (7/34, 20.5 %). In the
      phylogenetic analysis, two distinct haplotype groups were observed. The first
      group contained the majority of the haplotypes, whereas the second had fewer
      haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found higher genetic polymorphism in
      the PkRAP-1 gene than the polymorphism level reported in a previous study. This
      observation may stem from the difference in sample size between the present (n = 
      30) and the previous (n = 5) study. Synonymous and non-synonymous mutation
      analysis indicated purifying (negative) selection of the gene. The separation of 
      PkRAP-1haplotypes into two groups provides further evidence to the postulation of
      two distinct P. knowlesi types or lineages.

TI  - Non-falciparum malaria infections in pregnant women in West Africa.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1092-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections are found in many parts 
      of sub-Saharan Africa but little is known about their importance in pregnancy.
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected at first antenatal clinic attendance from
      2526 women enrolled in a trial of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria
      in pregnancy (ISTp) versus intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) conducted in 
      Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana and Mali. DNA was extracted from blood spots and 
      tested for P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium
      ovale using a nested PCR test. Risk factors for a non-falciparum malaria
      infection were investigated and the influence of these infections on the outcome 
      of pregnancy was determined. RESULTS: P. falciparum infection was detected
      frequently (overall prevalence by PCR: 38.8 %, [95 % CI 37.0, 40.8]), with a
      prevalence ranging from 10.8 % in The Gambia to 56.1 % in Ghana. Non-falciparum
      malaria infections were found only rarely (overall prevalence 1.39 % [95 % CI
      1.00, 1.92]), ranging from 0.17 % in the Gambia to 3.81 % in Mali. Ten
      non-falciparum mono-infections and 25 mixed falciparum and non-falciparum
      infections were found. P. malariae was the most frequent non-falciparum infection
      identified; P. vivax was detected only in Mali. Only four of the non-falciparum
      mono-infections were detected by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test. Recruitment
      during the late rainy season and low socio-economic status were associated with
      an increased risk of non-falciparum malaria as well as falciparum malaria. The
      outcome of pregnancy did not differ between women with a non-falciparum malaria
      infection and those who were not infected with malaria at first ANC attendance.
      CONCLUSIONS: Non-falciparum infections were infrequent in the populations
      studied, rarely detected when present as a mono-infection and unlikely to have
      had an important impact on the outcome of pregnancy in the communities studied
      due to the small number of women infected with non-falciparum parasites.

LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1104-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of molecular techniques has put in the spotlight the
      existence of a large mass of malaria sub-microscopic infections among apparently 
      healthy populations. These sub-microscopic infections are considered an important
      pool for maintained malaria transmission. METHODS: In order to assess the
      appearance of Plasmodium vivax gametocytes in circulation, gametocyte density and
      the parasite infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes, a study was designed to compare
      three groups of volunteers either experimentally infected with P. vivax
      sporozoites (early infections; n = 16) or naturally infected patients (acute
      malaria, n = 16 and asymptomatic, n = 14). In order to determine gametocyte
      stage, a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) assay targeting two
      sexual stage-specific molecular markers was used. Parasite infectivity was
      assessed by membrane feeding assays (MFA). RESULTS: In early infections P. vivax 
      gametocytes could be detected starting at day 7 without giving rise to infected
      mosquitoes during 13 days of follow-up. Asymptomatic carriers, with presumably
      long-lasting infections, presented the highest proportion of mature gametocytes
      and were as infective as acute patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the
      potential role of P. vivax asymptomatic carriers in malaria transmission should
      be considered when new policies are envisioned to redirect malaria control
      strategies towards targeting asymptomatic infections as a tool for malaria
      elimination.

TI  - Field evaluation of a PfHRP-2/pLDH rapid diagnostic test and light microscopy for
      diagnosis and screening of falciparum malaria during the peak seasonal
      transmission in an endemic area in Yemen.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1103-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a public health threat in Yemen, with 149,451 cases being 
      reported in 2013. Of these, Plasmodium falciparum represents 99%. Prompt
      diagnosis by light microscopy (LM) and rapid diagnostic tests (RTDs) is a key
      element in the national strategy of malaria control. The heterogeneous
      epidemiology of malaria in the country necessitates the field evaluation of the
      current diagnostic strategies, especially RDTs. Thus, the present study aimed to 
      evaluate LM and an RDT, combining both P. falciparum histidine-rich protein-2
      (PfHRP-2) and Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), for falciparum malaria
      diagnosis and survey in a malaria-endemic area during the transmission season
      against nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the reference method. METHODS: 
      A household-based, cross-sectional malaria survey was conducted in Mawza
      District, a malaria-endemic area in Taiz governorate. A total of 488 participants
      were screened using LM and PfHRP-2/pLDH RDT. Positive samples (160) and randomly 
      selected negative samples (52) by both RDT and LM were further analysed using 18S
      rRNA-based nested PCR. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
      value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the RDT were 96.0% (95%
      confidence interval (CI): 90.9-98.3), 56.0% (95% CI: 44.7-66.8), 76.3% (95% CI:
      69.0-82.3), and 90.4% (95% CI: 78.8-96.8), respectively. On the other hand, LM
      showed sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI: 29.6-46.3), specificity of 97.6% (95% CI:
      91.7-99.7), PPV of 95.9% (95% CI: 86.3-98.9), and NPV of 51.3% (95% CI:
      43.2-59.2). The sensitivity of LM dropped to 8.5% for detecting asymptomatic
      malaria. Malaria prevalence was 32.8% (32.1 and 37.5% for >/=10 and <10 years,
      respectively) with the RDT compared with 10.7% (10.8 and 9.4% for age groups of
      >/=10 and <10 years, respectively) with LM. Among asymptomatic malaria
      individuals, LM and RDT-based prevalence rates were 1.6 and 25.6%, respectively. 
      However, rates of 88.2 and 94.1% of infection with P. falciparum were found among
      patients who reported fever in the 48 h prior to the survey by LM and
      PfHRP-2/pLDH RDT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PfHRP-2/pLDH RDT shows high
      sensitivity for the survey of falciparum malaria even for asymptomatic malaria
      cases. Although the RDT had high sensitivity, its high false-positivity rate
      limits its utility as a single diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of malaria.
      On the other hand, low sensitivity of LM indicates that a high proportion of
      malaria cases is missed, underestimating the true prevalence of malaria in the
      community. Higher NPV of PfHRP-2/pLDH RDT than LM can give a straightforward
      exclusion of malaria among febrile patients, helping to avoid unnecessary
      presumptive treatments.

TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis and evolutionary history of
      haemoglobin-processing and haem detoxification enzymes in malarial parasites.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1097-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites have evolved a series of intricate mechanisms to
      survive and propagate within host red blood cells. Intra-erythrocytic parasitism 
      requires these organisms to digest haemoglobin and detoxify iron-bound haem.
      These tasks are executed by haemoglobin-specific proteases and haem
      biocrystallization factors that are components of a large multi-subunit complex. 
      Since haemoglobin processing machineries are functionally and genetically linked 
      to the modes of action and resistance mechanisms of several anti-malarial drugs, 
      an understanding of their evolutionary history is important for drug development 
      and drug resistance prevention. METHODS: Maximum likelihood trees of genetic
      repertoires encoding haemoglobin processing machineries within Plasmodium
      species, and with the representatives of Apicomplexan species with various host
      tropisms, were created. Genetic variants were mapped onto existing
      three-dimensional structures. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data
      were used to analyse the selective pressure and the effect of these mutations at 
      the structural level. RESULTS: Recent expansions in the falcipain and plasmepsin 
      repertoires are unique to human malaria parasites especially in the Plasmodium
      falciparum and P. reichenowi lineage. Expansion of haemoglobin-specific
      plasmepsins occurred after the separation event of Plasmodium species, but the
      other members of the plasmepsin family were evolutionarily conserved with one
      copy for each sub-group in every Apicomplexan species. Haemoglobin-specific
      falcipains are separated from invasion-related falcipain, and their expansions
      within one specific locus arose independently in both P. falciparum and P. vivax 
      lineages. Gene conversion between P. falciparum falcipain 2A and 2B was observed 
      in artemisinin-resistant strains. Comparison between the numbers of
      non-synonymous and synonymous mutations suggests a strong selective pressure at
      falcipain and plasmepsin genes. The locations of amino acid changes from
      non-synonymous mutations mapped onto protein structures revealed clusters of
      amino acid residues in close proximity or near the active sites of proteases.
      CONCLUSION: A high degree of polymorphism at the haemoglobin processing genes
      implicates an imposition of selective pressure. The identification in recent
      years of functional redundancy of haemoglobin-specific proteases makes them less 
      appealing as potential drug targets, but their expansions, especially in the
      human malaria parasite lineages, unequivocally point toward their functional
      significance during the independent and repetitive adaptation events in malaria
      parasite evolutionary history.

      prospectively studied the aetiology of febrile illness in 677 children aged 2-59 
      months with acute uncomplicated fever managed by IMCI (Integrated Management of
      Childhood Illness) guidelines in Zanzibar, using point-of-care tests, urine
      culture, blood-PCR, chest X-ray (CXR) of IMCI-pneumonia classified patients, and 
      multiple quantitative (q)PCR investigations of nasopharyngeal (NPH) (all
      patients) and rectal (GE) swabs (diarrhoea patients). For comparison, we also
      performed NPH and GE qPCR analyses in 167 healthy community controls. Final fever
      diagnoses were retrospectively established based on all clinical and laboratory
      data. Clinical outcome was assessed during a 14-day follow-up. The utility of
      IMCI for identifying infections presumed to require antibiotics was evaluated.
      FINDINGS: NPH-qPCR and GE-qPCR detected >/=1 pathogen in 657/672 (98%) and
      153/164 (93%) of patients and 158/166 (95%) and 144/165 (87%) of controls,
      respectively. Overall, 57% (387/677) had IMCI-pneumonia, but only 12% (42/342)
      had CXR-confirmed pneumonia. Two patients were positive for Plasmodium
      falciparum. Respiratory syncytial virus (24.5%), influenza A/B (22.3%),
      rhinovirus (10.5%) and group-A streptococci (6.4%), CXR-confirmed pneumonia
      (6.2%), Shigella (4.3%) were the most common viral and bacterial fever diagnoses,
      respectively. Blood-PCR conducted in a sub-group of patients (n = 83) without
      defined fever diagnosis was negative for rickettsiae, chikungunya, dengue, Rift
      Valley fever and West Nile viruses. Antibiotics were prescribed to 500 (74%)
      patients, but only 152 (22%) had an infection retrospectively considered to
      require antibiotics. Clinical outcome was generally good. However, two children
      died. Only 68 (11%) patients remained febrile on day 3 and three of them had
      verified fever on day 14. An additional 29 (4.5%) children had fever relapse on
      day 14. Regression analysis determined C-reactive Protein (CRP) as the only
      independent variable significantly associated with CXR-confirmed pneumonia.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on uncomplicated febrile illness in African 
      children that both applied a comprehensive laboratory panel and a healthy control
      group. A majority of patients had viral respiratory tract infection. Pathogens
      were frequently detected by qPCR also in asymptomatic children, demonstrating the
      importance of incorporating controls in fever aetiology studies. The precision of
      IMCI for identifying infections requiring antibiotics was low.

TI  - DNA Sequence Polymorphism of the Lactate Dehydrogenase Genefrom Iranian
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum Isolates.
PG  - 505-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) is extensively employed as
      malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Moreover, it is a well-known drug target
      candidate. However, the genetic diversity of this gene might influence
      performance of RDT kits and its drug target candidacy. This study aimed to
      determine polymorphism of pLDH gene from Iranian isolates of P. vivax and P.
      falciparum. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood of
      microscopically confirmed P. vivax and P. falciparum infected patients. pLDH gene
      of P. falciparum and P. vivax was amplified using conventional PCR from 43
      symptomatic malaria patients from Sistan and Baluchistan Province, Southeast Iran
      from 2012 to 2013. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of 15 P. vivax LDH showed fourteen 
      had 100% identity with P. vivax Sal-1 and Belem strains. Two nucleotide
      substitutions were detected with only one resulted in amino acid change. Analysis
      of P. falciparum LDH sequences showed six of the seven sequences had 100%
      homology with P. falciparum 3D7 and Mzr-1. Moreover, PfLDH displayed three
      nucleotide changes that resulted in changing only one amino acid. PvLDH and PfLDH
      showed 75%-76% nucleotide and 90.4%-90.76% amino acid homology. CONCLUSION: pLDH 
      gene from Iranian P. falciparum and P. vivax isolates displayed 98.8-100%
      homology with 1-3 nucleotide substitutions. This indicated this gene was
      relatively conserved. Additional studies can be done weather this genetic
      variation can influence the performance of pLDH based RDTs or not.

TI  - In Vivo Efficacy and Parasite Clearance of Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine
      Versus Artemether-Lumefantrine in Mali.
PG  - 634-9
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0503 [doi]
AB  - Although artemisinin resistance has yet to be reported in Africa, surveillance of
      the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is warranted.
      Here, the efficacy of artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was evaluated in Mali. Randomized open-label
      comparative in vivo assay of AS + SP versus AL were carried out using the 28-day 
      follow-up World Health Organization protocol. Patients with uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria and at least 6 months of age were recruited between October
      2010 and January 2014. A subset of these patients was selected to measure
      Plasmodium falciparum clearance time. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected
      adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 100% for AS + SP and 98.2%
      for AL with no significant difference (P = 0.06). The reinfection rates were
      comparable (P = 0.63) with 8.0% for AS + SP and 12.6% for AL. Individuals under 8
      years were more susceptible to treatment failure (relative risk = 1.9; 95%
      confidence interval = 1.2, 3.3). Median parasite clearance half-life was 1.7
      hours (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3-2.2) for AS + SP and 1.9 hours (IQR =
      1.5-2.5) for AL with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.24). Efficacy
      of AS + SP and AL was high. This study provides baseline information on parasite 
      clearance half-lives after ACT treatment, particularly AS + SP, in Mali.

      in Pakistan.
PG  - e0004399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004399 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Military conflict has been a major challenge in the detection and
      control of emerging infectious diseases such as malaria. It poses issues
      associated with enhancing emergence and transmission of infectious diseases by
      destroying infrastructure and collapsing healthcare systems. The Orakzai agency
      in Pakistan has witnessed a series of intense violence and destruction. Military 
      conflicts and instability in Afghanistan have resulted in the migration of
      refugees into the area and possible introduction of many infectious disease
      epidemics. Due to the ongoing violence and Talibanization, it has been a
      challenge to conduct an epidemiological study. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      All patients were sampled within the transmission season. After a detailed
      clinical investigation of patients, data were recorded. Baseline venous blood
      samples were taken for microscopy and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR)
      analysis. Plasmodium species were detected using nested PCR (nPCR) and
      amplification of the small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (ssrRNA) genes
      using the primer pairs. We report a clinical assessment of the epidemic situation
      of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax (86.5%) and Plasmodium falciparum (11.79%) 
      infections with analysis of complications in patients such as decompensated shock
      (41%), anemia (8.98%), hypoglycaemia (7.3%), multiple convulsions (6.7%),
      hyperpyrexia (6.17%), jaundice (5%), and hyperparasitaemia (4.49%).
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This overlooked distribution of P. vivax should be
      considered by malaria control strategy makers in the world and by the Government 
      of Pakistan. In our study, children were the most susceptible population to
      malaria infection while they were the least expected to use satisfactory
      prevention strategies in such a war-torn deprived region. Local health
      authorities should initiate malaria awareness programs in schools and
      malaria-related education should be further promoted at the local level reaching 
      out to both children and parents.

      Isolates from Pregnant Women in Lagos, Nigeria.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146908 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of antimalarial drugs for prevention and treatment is a major
      strategy in the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. Although
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently recommended for intermittent
      preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy in Nigeria, previously used
      drugs for prophylaxis such as chloroquine (CQ) and pyrimethamine are accessible
      as they are purchased over the counter. This study describes the markers of
      absence or presence of resistance to quinoline (Pfcrt and Pfmdr 1) and type 1
      antifolate antimalarial medicines (Pfdhfr). METHODS: Plasmodium
      falciparum-positive dried blood spots from pregnant women attending antenatal
      clinics for the first time during current pregnancy were investigated for the
      presence of mutations at codons 72-76 of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine
      resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      using haplotype-specific probes. PCR followed by sequence analysis was used to
      identify mutations at codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042 and 1246 of P. falciparum
      multi-drug resistance-1 (Pfmdr1) gene; and codons 16, 50, 51, 59, 108, 140 and
      164 of Pfdhfr gene. RESULTS: Two haplotypes of Pfcrt (n = 54) were observed:
      CVMNK 13(24.2%) and CVIET 41 (75.9%) of the samples. The SVMNT haplotype was
      absent in this population. The Pfmdr1 (n = 28) haplotypes were NYSND 15(53.6%),
      YYSND 5(17.9%), NFSND 6(21.4%) and YFSND 2(7.1%). The Pfdhfr (n = 15) were
      ACNCSVI 4(26.7%), and ACICNSVI 1(6.7%) and ACIRNVI 10 (66.7%). The rate of
      occurrence of Pfcrt 76T, Pfdhfr108N, Pfmdr186Y and 184F were 75.9%, 73.3%, 25%
      and 28.1% respectively. The Pfmdr1 86Y was associated with low parasitaemia
      (median = 71 parasites/mul, P = 0.024) while Pfcrt 76T was associated with young 
      maternal age (mean 24.1 +/- 4.5 years; P = 0.006). The median parasitaemia were
      similar (P>0.05) in wild and mutant strains of Pfcrt 76, Pfmdr1 184 and Pfdhfr
      108. There was no association between gravidity or gestational age of the women
      and presence of mutations in the Pfcrt, Pfmdr1 or Pfdhfr genes (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Markers of resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine were high,
      whereas cycloguanil-resistance marker was not present in the studied population. 
      The low level of mutations in the Pfmdr1gene indicates likely efficacy of
      amodiaquine against malaria in pregnancy.

      combination therapy treatment of Kenyan children.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1095-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in Southeast Asia reported a strong relationship between
      polymorphisms at the propeller domain of the Kelch 13 (K13) protein encoded by
      the Plasmodium falciparum k13 (pfk13) gene and delayed parasite clearance after
      artemisinin treatment. In Africa, P. falciparum remains susceptible and
      combination therapy regimens which include an artemisinin component display good 
      efficacy. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), sub-microscopic persistence of
      P. falciparum has previously been reported in one-third of children treated with 
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in western Kenya. In this study, further
      investigation was made to evaluate whether these sub-microscopic residual
      parasites also harbour mutations at the propeller region of pfk13 and whether the
      mutations, if any, affect treatment outcome. METHODS: The pfk13 propeller domain 
      was genotyped in DNA samples obtained in 2009 from Kenyan children treated with
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Paired
      samples at pre-treatment (day 0) and day of treatment failure (day 28 or 42) for 
      32 patients with documented recurrent parasitaemia were available for genotyping.
      Additional day 3 DNA samples were available for 10 patients. RESULTS: No mutation
      associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia was observed. Only one
      DP-treated patient harboured a non-synonymous mutation at codon 578 (A578S) of
      pfk13-propeller gene in the day 0 sample, but this allele was replaced by the
      wild-type (A578) form on day 3 and on the day of recurrent parasitaemia. The
      mutation at amino acid codon 578 showed no association with any phenotype.
      Polymorphisms in pfk13 were not responsible for parasite persistence and
      gametocyte carriage in the children treated with ACT. CONCLUSION: This study
      contributes to the ongoing surveillance of suspected artemisinin resistance
      parasites in Africa by providing baseline prevalence of k13-propeller mutations
      in western Kenya with samples collected from a longitudinal study. Clinical
      Trials Registration NCT00868465.

      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in northwest Benin.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1091-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem((R))) has been used as a treatment
      for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection since 2004 in Benin. This
      open-label, non-randomized study evaluated efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine
      (AL) in treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children aged 6-59
      months in two malaria transmission sites in northwest Benin. METHODS: A 42-day
      therapeutic efficacy study was conducted between August and November 2014, in
      accordance with 2009 WHO guidelines. One-hundred and twenty-three children, aged 
      6 months to 5 years, with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited into
      the study. The primary endpoint was parasitological cure on day 28 and day 42
      while the secondary endpoints included: parasite and fever clearance, improvement
      in haemoglobin levels. Outcomes were classified as early treatment failure (ETF),
      late clinical failure, late parasitological failure, and adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR). RESULTS: Before PCR correction, ACPR rates were 
      87% (95 % CI 76.0-94.7) and 75.6%, respectively (95% CI 67.0-82.9) on day 28 and 
      day 42. In each study site, ACPR rates were 78.3% in Djougou and 73% in Cobly on 
      day 42. There was no ETF and after PCR correction ACPR was 100% in study
      population. All treatment failures were shown to be due to new infections. Fever 
      was significantly cleared in 24 h and approximately 90% of parasites where
      cleared on day 1 and almost all parasites were cleared on day 2. Haemoglobin
      concentration showed a slight increase with parasitic clearance. CONCLUSION: AL
      remains an efficacious drug for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      in Benin, although higher rates of re-infection remain a concern. Surveillance
      needs to be continued to detect future changes in parasite sensitivity to
      artemisinin-based combination therapy.

TI  - Epidemiological and entomological studies of a malaria outbreak among French
      armed forces deployed at illegal gold mining sites reveal new aspects of the
      disease's transmission in French Guiana.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1088-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2010, a Plasmodium vivax malaria outbreak occurred among 
      French forces involved in a mission to control illegal gold mining in French
      Guiana. The findings of epidemiological and entomological investigations
      conducted after this outbreak are presented here. METHODS: Data related to
      malaria cases reported to the French armed forces epidemiological surveillance
      system were collected during the epidemic period from December 2010 to April
      2011. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify presumed
      contamination sites. Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled at the identified sites
      using Mosquito Magnet and CDC light traps. Specimens were identified
      morphologically and confirmed using molecular methods (sequencing of ITS2 gene
      and/or barcoding). Anopheles infections with Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax
      were tested by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time PCR. RESULTS:
      Seventy-two P. vivax malaria cases were reported (three were mixed P.
      falciparum/P. vivax infections), leading to a global attack rate of 26.5%
      (72/272). Lack of compliance with vector control measures and doxycycline
      chemoprophylaxis was reported by patients. Two illegal gold mining sites located 
      in remote areas in the primary forest were identified as places of contamination.
      In all, 595 Anopheles females were caught and 528 specimens were formally
      identified: 305 Anopheles darlingi, 145 Anopheles nuneztovari s.l., 63 Anopheles 
      marajoara and 15 Anopheles triannulatus s.l. Three An. darlingi were infected by 
      P. falciparum (infection rate: 1.1%) and four An. marajoara by P. vivax
      (infection rate: 6.4%). DISCUSSION: The main drivers of the outbreak were the
      lack of adherence by military personnel to malaria prevention measures and the
      high level of malaria transmission at illegal gold mining sites. Anopheles
      marajoara was clearly implicated in malaria transmission for the first time in
      French Guiana. The high infection rates observed confirm that illegal gold mining
      sites must be considered as high level malaria transmission areas in the
      territory. CONCLUSIONS: Illegal gold mining activities are challenging the
      control of malaria in French Guiana. Collaboration with neighbouring countries is
      necessary to take into account mobile populations such as gold miners. Malaria
      control strategies in the French armed forces must be adapted to P. vivax malaria
      and sylvatic Anopheles species.

TI  - Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapy Versus Quinine or Other Combinations for
      Treatment of Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in the Second and Third 
      Trimester of Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - ofv170
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofv170 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies 
      (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and
      third trimesters of pregnancy. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare efficacy, 
      safety and tolerability of ACTs versus quinine and other non-ACT antimalarials.
      The median PCR-adjusted failure rate by days 28 to 63 in the non-ACT group was 6 
      (range 0-37) per 100 women, lower in the ACT group overall (pooled risk ratio
      [PRR] random effects, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-1.05; 6 trials),
      and significantly lower compared with oral quinine (PRR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49;
      4 trials). There were no differences in fetal deaths and congenital
      abnormalities. Compared with quinine, artemisinin-based combinations therapies
      were associated with less tinnitus (PRR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-1.11; 4 studies),
      dizziness (PRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.93; 3 trials), and vomiting (PRR, 0.33; 95% 
      CI, 0.15-0.73; 3 trials). Artemisinin-based combination therapies are better than
      quinine in the second and third trimesters; their use should be encouraged among 
      health workers.

TI  - Molecular Characterization Reveals Diverse and Unknown Malaria Vectors in the
      Western Kenyan Highlands.
PG  - 327-35
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0562 [doi]
AB  - The success of mosquito-based malaria control is dependent upon susceptible
      bionomic traits in local malaria vectors. It is crucial to have accurate and
      reliable methods to determine mosquito species composition in areas subject to
      malaria. An unexpectedly diverse set of Anopheles species was collected in the
      western Kenyan highlands, including unidentified and potentially new species
      carrying the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This study identified 2,340 
      anopheline specimens using both ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region 
      2 and mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 loci. Seventeen distinct
      sequence groups were identified. Of these, only eight could be molecularly
      identified through comparison to published and voucher sequences. Of the
      unidentified species, four were found to carry P. falciparum by circumsporozoite 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction, the most
      abundant of which had infection rates comparable to a primary vector in the area,
      Anopheles funestus. High-quality adult specimens of these unidentified species
      could not be matched to museum voucher specimens or conclusively identified using
      multiple keys, suggesting that they may have not been previously described. These
      unidentified vectors were captured outdoors. Diverse and unknown species have
      been incriminated in malaria transmission in the western Kenya highlands using
      molecular identification of unusual morphological variants of field specimens.
      This study demonstrates the value of using molecular methods to compliment vector
      identifications and highlights the need for accurate characterization of mosquito
      species and their associated behaviors for effective malaria control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sensitive and specific detection of malarial parasites is crucial in 
      controlling the significant malaria burden in the developing world. Also
      important is being able to identify life threatening Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria quickly and accurately to reduce malaria related mortality. Existing
      methods such as microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have major
      shortcomings. Here, we describe a new real-time PCR-based diagnostic test device 
      at point-of-care service for resource-limited settings. METHODS: Truenat(R)
      Malaria, a chip-based microPCR test, was developed by bigtec Labs, Bangalore,
      India, for differential identification of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax parasites. The Truenat Malaria tests runs on bigtec's Truelab Uno(R)
      microPCR device, a handheld, battery operated, and easy-to-use real-time microPCR
      device. The performance of Truenat(R) Malaria was evaluated versus the WHO nested
      PCR protocol. The Truenat(R) Malaria was further evaluated in a triple-blinded
      study design using a sample panel of 281 specimens created from the clinical
      samples characterized by expert microscopy and a rapid diagnostic test kit by the
      National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR). A comparative evaluation was done 
      on the Truelab Uno(R) and a commercial real-time PCR system. RESULTS: The limit
      of detection of the Truenat Malaria assay was found to be <5 parasites/mul for
      both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The Truenat(R) Malaria test was found to have
      sensitivity and specificity of 100% each, compared to the WHO nested PCR protocol
      based on the evaluation of 100 samples. The sensitivity using expert microscopy
      as the reference standard was determined to be around 99.3% (95% CI: 95.5-99.9)
      at the species level. Mixed infections were identified more accurately by Truenat
      Malaria (32 samples identified as mixed) versus expert microscopy and RDTs which 
      detected 4 and 5 mixed samples, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Truenat(R) Malaria 
      microPCR test is a valuable diagnostic tool and implementation should be
      considered not only for malaria diagnosis but also for active surveillance and
      epidemiological intervention.

AB  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum may pose challenges in malaria
      treatment and prevention through chemotherapy and vaccination. We assessed
      Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection (MOI) of P.
      falciparum infections and sort relationship of parasitaemia with P. falciparum
      msp2 genotypes as well as with the number of infecting clones. The study was
      carried out in Kibaha, Tanzania. Ninety-nine children under five years with
      uncomplicated malaria were recruited. Genetic diversity was analyzed by
      genotyping the msp2 gene using PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism.
      Thirty-two different msp2 alleles were obtained. The msp2 3D7 allelic frequency
      was higher (48.1%) and more prevalent than FC27 (27.3%) (p < 0.05). Twenty-four
      percent of the infections were mixed alleles. The individuals with FC27 had high 
      parasitemia compared to those with 3D7 alleles (p = 0.038). The mean MOI was low 
      (1.4 clones, 95% CI 1.2-1.5). The P. falciparum population among children at
      Kibaha is composed of distinct P. falciparum clones, and parasites having 3D7 are
      more frequent than those with FC27 alleles. Individuals with parasite having FC27
      alleles have high parasite densities suggesting that parasites with FC27 alleles 
      may associate with severity of disease in Kibaha. Low MOI at Kibaha suggests low 
      malaria transmission rate.

AB  - We have developed a convenient, robust and low-cost RNA detection system suitable
      for high-throughput applications. This system uses a highly specific sandwich
      hybridization to capture target RNA directly onto solid support, followed by
      on-site signal amplification via 2-dimensional, branched hybridizing chain
      polymerization through toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. The assay
      uses SYBR Green to detect targets at concentrations as low as 1 pM, without
      involving nucleic acid purification or any enzymatic reaction, using ordinary
      oligonucleotides without modification or labeling. The system was demonstrated in
      the detection of malaria RNA in blood and GAPDH gene expression in cell lysate.

TI  - Cerebral malaria in a man with Plasmodium vivax mono-infection: a case report.
PG  - 241-245
AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is a diffuse encephalopathy associated with coma and
      seizures commonly caused by Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) in children
      with severe malaria. We present a case of a 19-year-old man with CM due to
      Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for
      Japanese B encephalitis, enterovirus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, varicella and mumps
      viruses as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). P. falciparum
      and P. vivax species were analysed by microscopy, immunochromatography and PCR
      assays and confirmed mono-infection of P. vivax in the patient's blood, and P.
      falciparum infection was established to be negative. The patient was discharged
      after intensive supportive care and antimalarial treatment (intravenous
      artesunate and oral doxycycline). We conclude that P. vivax infection is
      associated with CM, a life-threatening complication rarely seen in coastal
      districts of Karnataka. In endemic areas, the possibility of CM should be
      considered even with P. vivax infection.

LID - bcr2015213591 [pii]
AB  - We present a case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man recently returned from Angola,
      where he had been successfully treated for a severe (non-cerebral) falciparum
      malaria infection. He was presented to the emergency room, with a subacute onset 
      encephalopathy, ataxia and a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (123 cells/microL) and
      hyperproteinorrhachia (188 mg/dL). Brain MRI and EEG were unremarkable. CSF PCR
      testing for neurotropic viruses was negative as were CSF and blood cultures. The 
      patient was treated with ceftriaxone and acyclovir, with full recovery on the
      second day of treatment. We believe post-malaria neurological syndrome, a rare
      self-limited encephalopathy, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. 
      Nevertheless, the presentation, lack of changes on brain MRI and EEG, along with 
      possible false-negative CSF viral PCR, could still represent a viral
      encephalitis, which brings to question the treatment approach to adopt
      (conservative vs wide spectrum antiviral plus antibiotics).

TI  - Malaria burden and anti-malarial drug efficacy in Owando, northern Congo.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1078-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Republic of Congo, previous epidemiological studies have only 
      been conducted in the south of the country where it is most accessible.
      Nationally representative data on the efficacy of new anti-malarial tools are
      lacking in the country. As an initial step to close the gap, clinical efficacy of
      two artemisinin-based combinations, artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL), was assessed in Owando, a city in equatorial
      flooded forest in northern Republic of Congo. METHODS: Under 12 years old febrile
      children attending public health facilities were screened for malaria parasites
      using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria
      and microscopic examination of thick blood films. Patients with at least 1,000
      asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasites/microl of blood were clinically examined,
      included after informed consent, and followed up for 28 days, according to the
      2009 World Health Organization protocol. Patients were randomly assigned to
      co-formulated ASAQ (Coarsucam((R))) or AL (Coartem((R))) treatment groups.
      Plasmodium falciparum recrudescent isolates were compared to pre-treatment
      isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using msp1, msp2, and glurp genes to 
      distinguish between re-infection and recrudescence. RESULTS: Between November
      2012 and February 2013, 857 under 12 years old febrile children were screened, of
      whom 198 (23.1%) had positive RDT and 167 (19.5%) positive thick films. ASAQ and 
      AL efficacies were 92.7 and 94.2% before PCR correction, respectively. After
      genotyping, the overall efficacy was 100% for ASAQ and 98.0% for AL. CONCLUSION: 
      The data reported here represent partially the burden of malaria in 0-11 years
      old febrile children examined in public health centres of Owando city and serve
      as reference for further studies. Both artemisinin-based combinations were highly
      efficacious in patients under 12 years old with acute uncomplicated malaria. ASAQ
      was associated with more adverse events, which may reduce compliance in
      unsupervised treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12612000940875.

      combinations in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in two ecological zones in
      Ghana.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Case management based on prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment
      using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) remains the main focus of
      malaria control in Ghana. As part of routine surveillance on the therapeutic
      efficacy of ACT in Ghana, the efficacy of amodiaquine-artesunate (AS-AQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) were studied in six sentinel sites representing the 
      forest and savannah zones of the country. METHODS: Three sites representing the
      two ecological zones studied AS-AQ whilst the other three sites studied AL. In
      each site, the study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical,
      parasitological, and haematological responses to directly observed therapy for
      uncomplicated malaria with either AS-AQ or AL among children aged 6 months and 9 
      years. The WHO 2009 protocol for monitoring anti-malarial drug efficacy was used 
      for the study between July 2013 and March 2014. RESULTS: Per-protocol analyses on
      day 28 showed an overall PCR-corrected cure rate of 100% for AS-AQ and 97.6% (95%
      CI 93.1, 99.5) for AL: 97.2% (95% CI 92.0, 99.4) in the forest zone and 100% in
      the savannah zone. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed similar outcomes.
      Prevalence of fever decreased by about 75% after the first day of treatment with 
      each ACT in the two ecological zones. No child studied was parasitaemic on day 3,
      and gametocytaemia was generally maintained at low levels (<5%). Post-treatment
      mean haemoglobin concentrations significantly increased in the two ecological
      zones. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic efficacy of AS-AQ and AL remains over 90% in the 
      forest and savannah zones of Ghana. Additionally, post-treatment parasitaemia on 
      day 3 is rare suggesting that artemisinin is still efficacious in Ghana.

TI  - Monocyte- and Neutrophil-Derived CXCL10 Impairs Efficient Control of Blood-Stage 
      Malaria Infection and Promotes Severe Disease.
PG  - 1227-38
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1501562 [doi]
AB  - CXCL10, or IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, is a biomarker associated with
      increased risk for Plasmodium falciparum-mediated cerebral malaria (CM).
      Consistent with this, we have previously shown that CXCL10 neutralization or
      genetic deletion alleviates brain intravascular inflammation and protects
      Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected mice from CM. In addition to organ-specific
      effects, the absence of CXCL10 during infection was also found to reduce parasite
      biomass. To identify the cellular sources of CXCL10 responsible for these
      processes, we irradiated and reconstituted wild-type (WT) and CXCL10(-/-) mice
      with bone marrow from either WT or CXCL10(-/-) mice. Similar to CXCL10(-/-) mice,
      chimeras unable to express CXCL10 in hematopoietic-derived cells controlled
      infection more efficiently than WT controls. In contrast, expression of CXCL10 in
      knockout mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow resulted in high parasite biomass
      levels, higher brain parasite and leukocyte sequestration rates, and increased
      susceptibility to CM. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were identified as
      the main cellular sources of CXCL10 responsible for the induction of these
      processes. The improved control of parasitemia observed in the absence of
      CXCL10-mediated trafficking was associated with a preferential accumulation of
      CXCR3(+)CD4(+) T follicular helper cells in the spleen and enhanced Ab responses 
      to infection. These results are consistent with the notion that some inflammatory
      responses elicited in response to malaria infection contribute to the development
      of high parasite densities involved in the induction of severe disease in target 
      organs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopy has long been considered to be the gold standard for
      diagnosis of malaria despite the introduction of newer assays. However, it has
      many challenges like requirement of trained microscopists and logistic issues. A 
      vision based device that can diagnose malaria, provide speciation and estimate
      parasitaemia was evaluated. METHODS: The device was evaluated using samples from 
      431 consented patients, 361 of which were initially screened by RDT and
      microscopy and later analysed by PCR. It was a prospective, non-randomized,
      blinded trial. Quantification of parasitaemia was performed by two experienced
      technicians. Samples were subjected to diagnosis by Sight Dx digital imaging
      scanning. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SightDx P1 device for
      analysed samples were found to be 97.05 and 96.33%, respectively, when compared
      to PCR. When compared to microscopy, sensitivity and specificity were found to be
      94.4 and 95.6%, respectively. The device was able to speciate 73.3% of the PCR
      Plasmodium falciparum positive samples and 91.4% of PCR Plasmodium vivax positive
      samples. CONCLUSION: The ability of the device to detect parasitaemia as compared
      with microscopy, was within 50% in 71.3% of cases and demonstrated a correlation 
      coefficient of 0.89.

AB  - Members of the Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein (PvRBP) family are
      believed to mediate specific invasion of reticulocytes by P. vivax. In this
      study, we performed molecular characterization of genes encoding members of this 
      protein family. Through cDNA sequencing, we constructed full-length gene models
      and verified genes that are protein coding and those that are pseudogenes. We
      also used quantitative PCR to measure their in vivo transcript abundances in
      clinical P. vivax isolates. Like genes encoding related invasion ligands of P.
      falciparum, Pvrbp expression levels vary broadly across different parasite
      isolates. Through antibody measurements, we found that host immune pressure may
      be the driving force behind the distinctly high diversity of one of the family
      members, PvRBP2c. Mild yet significant negative correlation was found between
      parasitemia and the PvRBP2b antibody level, suggesting that antibodies to the
      protein may interfere with invasion.

TI  - Use of Blood Smears and Dried Blood Spots for Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based

      Severely Ill Febrile African Children.

AB  - Molecular approaches offer a means of testing archived samples stored as dried
      blood spots in settings where standard blood cultures are not possible.
      Peripheral blood films are one suggested source of material, although the
      sensitivity of this approach has not been well defined. Thin blood smears and
      dried blood spots from a severe pediatric malaria study were assessed using
      specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers to detect non-typhoidal
      Salmonella (NTS; MisL gene), Streptococcus pneumoniae (lytA), and Plasmodium
      falciparum (18S rRNA). Of 16 cases of NTS and S. pneumoniae confirmed on blood
      culture, none were positive by PCR using DNA extracts from blood films or dried
      blood spots. In contrast, four of 36 dried blood spots and two of 178 plasma
      samples were PCR positive for S. pneumoniae, despite negative bacterial blood
      cultures, suggesting false positives. Quantitative assessment revealed that the
      effective concentration of P. falciparum DNA in blood films was three log orders 
      of magnitude lower than for dried blood spots. The P. falciparum kelch13 gene
      could not be amplified from blood films. These findings question the value of
      blood PCR-based approaches for detection of NTS and S. pneumoniae, and show that 
      stored blood films are an inefficient method of studying P. falciparum.

AB  - Immunization of volunteers under chloroquine prophylaxis by bites of Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ)-infected mosquitoes induces > 90% protection
      against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). We studied intradermal
      immunization with cryopreserved, infectious PfSPZ in volunteers taking
      chloroquine (PfSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccine [CVac]). Vaccine groups 1 and 3
      received 3x monthly immunizations with 7.5 x 10(4) PfSPZ. Control groups 2 and 4 
      received normal saline. Groups 1 and 2 underwent CHMI (#1) by mosquito bite 60
      days after the third immunization. Groups 3 and 4 were boosted 168 days after the
      third immunization and underwent CHMI (#2) 137 days later. Vaccinees (11/20, 55%)
      and controls (6/10, 60%) had the same percentage of mild to moderate solicited
      adverse events. After CHMI #1, 8/10 vaccinees (group 1) and 5/5 controls (group
      2) became parasitemic by microscopy; the two negatives were positive by
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). After CHMI #2, all
      vaccinees in group 3 and controls in group 4 were parasitemic by qPCR. Vaccinees 
      showed weak antibody and no detectable cellular immune responses. Intradermal
      immunization with up to 3 x 10(5) PfSPZ-CVac was safe, but induced only minimal
      immune responses and no sterile protection against Pf CHMI.

TI  - An ultrasensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay to detect
      asymptomatic low-density Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections in
      small volume blood samples.
PG  - 520
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1038-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive, scalable diagnostic methods are needed to guide
      malaria elimination interventions. While traditional microscopy and rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) are suitable for the diagnosis of symptomatic malaria
      infection, more sensitive tests are needed to screen for low-density,
      asymptomatic infections that are targeted by interventions aiming to eliminate
      the entire reservoir of malaria infection in humans. METHODS: A reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) was developed for multiplexed
      detection of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and ribosomal RNA of Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Simulated field samples stored for 14 days with 
      sample preservation buffer were used to assess the analytical sensitivity and
      specificity. Additionally, 1750 field samples from Southeastern Myanmar were
      tested both by RDT and ultrasensitive RT-PCR. RESULTS: Limits of detection (LoD) 
      were determined under simulated field conditions. When 0.3 mL blood samples were 
      stored for 14 days at 28 degrees C and 80% humidity, the LoD was less than 16
      parasites/mL for P. falciparum and 19.7 copies/microL for P. vivax (using a
      plasmid surrogate), about 10,000-fold lower than RDTs. Of the 1739 samples
      successfully evaluated by both ultrasensitive RT-PCR and RDT, only two were RDT
      positive while 24 were positive for P. falciparum, 108 were positive for P.
      vivax, and 127 were positive for either P. vivax and/or P. falciparum using
      ultrasensitive RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: This ultrasensitive RT-PCR method is a
      robust, field-tested screening method that is vastly more sensitive than RDTs.
      Further optimization may result in a truly scalable tool suitable for widespread 
      surveillance of low-level asymptomatic P. falciparum and P. vivax parasitaemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in Yemen is mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum and 25% of
      the population is at high risk. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) had been used as
      monotherapy against P. falciparum. Emergence of chloroquine resistance led to the
      shift in anti-malarial treatment policy in Yemen to artemisinin-based combination
      therapy, that is artesunate (AS) plus SP as first-line therapy for uncomplicated 
      malaria and artemether-lumefantrine as second-line treatment. This study aimed to
      screen mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
      synthetase (dhps) genes associated with SP resistance among P. falciparum
      population in Hadhramout governorate, Yemen. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted
      from dried blood spots of 137 P. falciparum isolates collected from a
      community-based study. DNA was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and subsequently sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes. Sequences were
      analysed for mutations in Pfdhfr gene codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 and in Pfdhps
      gene codons 436, 437, and 540. RESULTS: A total of 128 and 114 P. falciparum
      isolates were successfully sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes, respectively.
      Each Pfdhfr mutant allele (I51 and N108) in P. falciparum population had a
      frequency of 84%. Pfdhfr R59 mutant allele was detected in one isolate. Mutation 
      at codon 437 (G437) in the Pfdhps gene was detected in 44.7% of falciparum
      malaria isolates. Frequencies of Pfdhfr double mutant genotype (I51C59N108I164)
      and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps triple mutant genotype (I51C59N108I164-S436G437K540) were 82.8 
      and 39.3%, respectively. One isolate harboured Pfdhfr triple mutant genotype
      (I51, R59, N108, I164) and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple mutant genotype
      (I51R59N108I164-S436G437K540). CONCLUSION: High frequencies of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps 
      mutant alleles and genotypes in P. falciparum population in Hadhramout, Yemen,
      highlight the risk of developing resistance for SP, the partner drug of AS, which
      subsequently will expose the parasite to AS monotherapy increasing then the
      potential of the emergence of AS resistance. Study findings necessitate the
      continuous monitoring of the efficacy of the national anti-malarial drugs policy 
      in Yemen. In addition, monitoring SP efficacy using molecular markers that has
      shown to be a practical and informative method for monitoring the partner drug of
      AS.

AB  - Deaths from Plasmodium knowlesi malaria have been linked to delayed parenteral
      treatment. In Malaysia, early intravenous artesunate is now recommended for all
      severe malaria cases. We describe P. knowlesi fatalities in Sabah, Malaysia,
      during 2012-2014 and report species-specific fatality rates based on 2010-2014
      case notifications. Sixteen malaria-associated deaths (caused by PCR-confirmed P.
      knowlesi [7], P. falciparum [7], and P. vivax [1] and microscopy-diagnosed "P.
      malariae" [1]) were reported during 2012-2014. Six patients with severe P.
      knowlesi malaria received intravenous artesunate at hospital admission. For
      persons >/=15 years of age, overall fatality rates during 2010-2014 were 3.4,
      4.2, and 1.0 deaths/1,000 P. knowlesi, P. falciparum, and P. vivax notifications,
      respectively; P. knowlesi-associated fatality rates fell from 9.2 to 1.6
      deaths/1,000 notifications. No P. knowlesi-associated deaths occurred among
      children, despite 373 notified cases. Although P. knowlesi malaria incidence is
      rising, the notification-fatality rate has decreased, likely due to improved use 
      of intravenous artesunate.

TI  - High prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infections: a cross-sectional study in
      rural areas in six departments in Haiti.
PG  - 510
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1051-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public health measures are poised for transition from malaria control
      to malaria elimination on the island of Hispaniola. Assessment of the reservoir
      of asymptomatic infections from which acute malaria cases may derive is critical 
      to plan and evaluate elimination efforts. Current field technology is ill suited 
      for detecting sub-microscopic infections, thus highly sensitive survey methods
      capable of detecting virtually all infections are needed. In this study the
      prevalence of infection with Plasmodium falciparum was determined in patients
      seeking medical care primarily for non-febrile conditions in six departments in
      Haiti using a newly designed qRT-PCR-based assay. METHODS: Three different
      methods of parasite detection were compared to assess their utility in
      approximating the prevalence of P. falciparum infections in the population:
      malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) designed to detect histidine-rich protein 2
      (HRP2), thick smear microscopy, and a quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay based upon the small sub-unit ribosomal
      RNA. The limit of detection of the qRT-PCR assay utilized was 0.0003
      parasite/microL of blood. Venous blood was obtained from a total of 563 subjects 
      from six departments in Haiti, all of whom were seeking medical attention without
      complaints consistent with malaria. Each subject was questioned for knowledge and
      behaviour using demographic and epidemiological survey to identify risk factors
      for disease transmission. RESULTS: Among the 563 samples tested, ten and 16 were 
      found positive for malaria by RDT and microscopy, respectively. Using the qRT-PCR
      test to assess the infection status of these subjects, an additional 92 were
      identified for a total of 108. Based upon the qRT-PCR assay results, a wide
      variation in prevalence of infection in asymptomatic subjects was seen between
      geographic locations ranging from 4-41%. The prevalence of infection was highest 
      in the Grand Anse, Nord and Sud-Est Departments, and demographic data from
      questionnaires provide evidence for focal disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      qRT-PCR assay is sufficiently sensitive to identify an unexpectedly large number 
      of asymptomatic, submicroscopic infections. Identifying and clearing these
      infections presents a significant challenge to both control and elimination
      efforts, but the qRT-PCR assay offers a reliable method to identify them.

TI  - Numerical Distributions of Parasite Densities During Asymptomatic Malaria.
PG  - 1322-9
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiv596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic parasitemia is common even in areas of low seasonal
      malaria transmission, but the true proportion of the population infected has not 
      been estimated previously because of the limited sensitivity of available
      detection methods. METHODS: Cross-sectional malaria surveys were conducted in
      areas of low seasonal transmission along the border between eastern Myanmar and
      northwestern Thailand and in western Cambodia. DNA was quantitated by an
      ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (uPCR) assay (limit of accurate
      detection, 22 parasites/mL) to characterize parasite density distributions for
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and the proportions of undetected
      infections were imputed. RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria as
      determined by uPCR was 27.5% (1303 of 4740 people tested). Both P. vivax and P.
      falciparum density distributions were unimodal and log normal, with modal values 
      well within the quantifiable range. The estimated proportions of all parasitemic 
      individuals identified by uPCR were >70% among individuals infected with P.
      falciparum and >85% among those infected with P. vivax. Overall, 83% of
      infections were predicted to be P. vivax infections, 13% were predicted to be P. 
      falciparum infections, and 4% were predicted to be mixed infections. Geometric
      mean parasite densities were similar; 5601 P. vivax parasites/mL and 5158 P.
      falciparum parasites/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This uPCR method identified most infected
      individuals in malaria-endemic areas. Malaria parasitemia persists in humans at
      levels that optimize the probability of generating transmissible gametocyte
      densities without causing illness.

      Guizhou Province].
PG  - 307-8
AB  - Malaria cases reported by county laboratories were further tested in the
      provincial laboratory in Guizhou province by using PCR test and microscopy. The
      consistency between PCR and microscopic results in the provincial laboratory was 
      set as the basis for evaluation of microscopic results in county laboratories. In
      89 samples, 24 were identified by PCR to be positive for malaria, among which 15 
      were infected with P. falciparum, 7 with P. vivax, and 2 with P. ovale; all were 
      imported cases. And 21 samples had consistent identifications by PCR test and
      microscopic examination in the provincial laboratory. The total coincidence rate 
      between county and provincial laboratories was 79.8%(67/84), and the undetected
      and error rates in county laboratories were 9.5%(2/21) and 23.8% (15/63),
      respectively. The Kappa value between county and provicial diagnosis was 0.6,
      being at the medium-to-high level of consistency.

TI  - [Analysis of MSP1 Allelotypes in Imported Cases of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria 
      from Africa].
PG  - 247-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the allelotype characteristics of the merozoite surface 
      protein 1 (MSP1) in imported Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: Blood samples were
      collected from P. falciparum-infected patients returning from African malaria
      endemic areas. Nested PCR was used to amplify gene fragments of MSP1 coding for
      block 2 and block 3 motifs of MSP1 of P. falciparum by using the MSP1-specific
      primers. Then the allelotype of MSPI was analyzed. RESULTS: The MSP1 allelotype
      was detected in 117 of 135 blood samples, with a detection rate of 86.7%. In the 
      117 cases with successful PCR amplification, the detection rates for MAD20, K1,
      RO33, MAD20+K1, MAD20+RO33, K1+RO33 and MAD20+K1+R033 were 6.0%(7/117),
      36.8%(43/117), 20.5%(24/117), 6.8% (8/117), 3.4% (4/117), 17.1% (20/117) and 9.4%
      (11/117), respectively, wherein the mixed infection accounted for 36.8%(43/135). 
      The mean multiplicity of infection(MOI) of MSP1 allelotype was 1.46. There was no
      significant difference in the proportion of patients with major severity of
      illness among the MAD20, K1 and RO33 genotypes. The proportions of patients with 
      major severity of illness were 25.7%(19/74) and 32.6%(14/43) in 74 cases of
      singular infection and 43 cases of mixed infection, respectively. The two
      infection types of patients had 241 +/- 176 days and 285 +/- 216 days of stay
      abroad, with no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: The three
      genotypes of MSP1 and their four types of combination exist in imported cases of 
      P. falciparum malaria from Africa. K1 and RO33 are the dominant genotves.

TI  - Evaluation of artemether-lumefantrine efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated 
      malaria and its association with pfmdr1, pfatpase6 and K13-propeller
      polymorphisms in Luanda, Angola.
PG  - 504
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1018-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has posed an obstacle to
      effective treatment and challenges many malaria control programmes in endemic
      areas. In Angola, until 2003, chloroquine (CQ) was used as first-line therapy for
      uncomplicated malaria. It was replaced initially by amodiaquine and, in 2006, by 
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with artemether-lumefantrine (AL,
      Coartem((R))). Efficacy study of ACT, conducted in Angola between 2004 and 2005, 
      showed a baseline efficacy of approximately 99%. METHODS: 103 malaria patients
      were enrolled according to WHO proceedings. Patients were followed up with
      clinical and parasitological evaluations for 28 days, parasite density and
      identification was evaluated by microscopy, the pfmsp2 were genotyped by
      nested-PCR, to distinguish parasite recrudescence from new infections; the
      polymorphisms at codons 86 and 1246 of pfmdr1 gene, and 769 of pfatp6 gene were
      assessed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing for pfk13-propeller genotype. RESULTS: The
      cure rate was 91.3%. The obtained results showed that from 103 patients, 12.6% (n
      = 13) still had parasitaemia 1 day after the treatment was finished. On day 0, of
      the 94 evaluated samples, wild-type alleles were identified in 73.4% (n = 69) for
      pfmdr1 N86Y position and only one sample carried the mutant allele (Y) for pfmdr1
      1246; 14% of these samples showed increased pfmdr1 copy number; 100% (n = 21) had
      wild-type allele of k13 gene in all the studied positions. DISCUSSION: These
      results showed changes in parasite profile susceptibility to AL in comparison to 
      the baseline data from 2002 to 2004 and on the genotyping characteristics; the
      clinical outcome after treatment with AL did not link a particular genotype with 
      treatment failure; observed changes do not provide sufficient evidence for a
      treatment policy change, but they suggest that a carefully monitoring is needed
      in this area.

TI  - Polymorphisms of the artemisinin resistant marker (K13) in Plasmodium falciparum 
      parasite populations of Grande Comore Island 10 years after artemisinin
      combination therapy.
PG  - 634
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-1253-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a significant public health problem 
      in Comoros, and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) remains the first choice
      for treating acute uncomplicated P. falciparum. The emergence and spread of
      artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in Southeast Asia, associated with mutations 
      in K13-propeller gene, poses a potential threat to ACT efficacy. Detection of
      mutations in the P. falciparum K13-propeller gene may provide the first-hand
      information on changes in parasite susceptibility to artemisinin. The objective
      of this study is to determinate the prevalence of mutant K13-propeller gene among
      the P. falciparum isolates collected from Grande Comore Island, Union of Comoros,
      where ACT has been in use since 2004. METHODS: A total of 207 P. falciparum
      clinical isolates were collected from the island during March 2006 and October
      2007 (n = 118) and March 2013 and December 2014 (n = 89). All isolates were
      analysed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the
      K13-propeller gene using nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Only three
      2006-2007 samples carried SNPs in the K13-propeller gene, one having a synonymous
      (G538G) and the other having two non-synonymous (S477Y and D584E) substitutions
      leading to two mutated haplotypes (2.2%, 2/95). Three synonymous mutations
      (R471R, Y500Y, and G538G) (5.9%, 5/85) and 7 non-synonymous substitutions (21.2%,
      18/85) with nine mutated haplotypes (18.8%, 16/85) were found in isolates from
      2013 to 2014. However, none of the polymorphisms associated with
      artemisinin-resistance in Southeast Asia was detected from any of the parasites
      examined. CONCLUSION: This study showed increased K13-propeller gene diversity
      among P. falciparum populations on the Island over the course of 8 years
      (2006-2014). Nevertheless, none of the polymorphisms known to be associated with 
      artemisinin resistance in Asia was detected in the parasite populations examined.
      Our data suggest that P. falciparum populations in Grande Comore are still
      effectively susceptible to artemisinin. Our results provide insights into P.
      falciparum populations regarding mutations in the gene associated with
      artemisinin resistance and will be useful for developing and updating
      anti-malarial guidance in Comoros.
