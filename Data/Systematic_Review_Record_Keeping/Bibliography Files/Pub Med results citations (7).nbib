TI  - Improved performance with saliva and urine as alternative DNA sources for malaria
      diagnosis by mitochondrial DNA-based PCR assays.

AB  - Saliva and urine from malaria-infected individuals contain trace amounts of
      Plasmodium DNA, and therefore, could be used as alternative specimens for
      diagnosis. A nested PCR targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb-PCR) 
      of four human malaria species and Plasmodium knowlesi was developed and tested
      with 693 blood samples from febrile patients living in diverse malaria-endemic
      areas of Thailand, and compared with microscopy and nested PCR targeting
      small-subunit rRNA (18S-PCR). Cytb-PCR was 16% and 39.8% more sensitive than
      18S-PCR and microscopy, respectively, in detecting all of these malarial species 
      in blood samples. Importantly, 34% and 17% of Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax mono-infections, respectively, detected by microscopy were, in
      fact, mixed P. falciparum and P. non-falciparum infections. Analysis of matched
      blood, saliva and urine from 157 individuals showed that microscopy and Cytb-PCR 
      of saliva yielded no significant difference in detecting P. falciparum and P.
      vivax. However, Cytb-PCR of saliva was more sensitive than microscopy for
      diagnosis of mixed-species infections. A combination of Cytb-PCR of saliva and of
      urine significantly outperformed microscopy (p 0.0098 for P. falciparum, p 0.006 
      for P. vivax, and p 0.0002 for mixed infections). Furthermore, Plasmodium
      malariae and P. knowlesi could also be identified in saliva and urine with this
      method. Therefore, the Cytb-PCR developed herein offers a high potential for the 
      use of both saliva and urine for malaria diagnosis, with a sensitivity comparable
      with or superior to that of microscopy.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism at the C-terminal domain (region III) of knob-associated
      histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) of Plasmodium falciparum in isolates from Iran.

AB  - The knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) plays a major role in the
      virulence of Plasmodium falciparum and is one of the targets for molecular
      therapy. The primary structure of KAHRP of P. falciparum consists of three
      domains (regions I-III), of which the C-terminal domain (region III) is the most 
      polymorphic segment of this protein. One of the main obstacles is genetic
      diversity in designing and developing of malaria control strategies such as
      molecular therapy and vaccines. The primary objective of the present study was to
      investigate and analyze the extent of genetic polymorphism at the region III of
      KAHRP of P. falciparum in isolates from Iran. A fragment of the kahrp gene
      spanning the C-terminal domain was amplified by nested PCR from 50 P. falciparum 
      isolates collected from two malaria endemic areas of Iran during 2009 to August
      2010 and sequenced. In this study, three allelic types were observed at the
      C-terminal domain of KAHRP on the basis of the molecular weight of nested PCR
      products and the obtained sequencing data. The presence of multiple alleles of
      the kahrp gene indicates that several P. falciparum strains exist in the malaria 
      endemic areas of Iran. Our findings will be valuable in the design and the
      development of the molecular therapeutic reagents for falciparum malaria.

      PfEMP1 genes during the course of infection in pregnant women.
PG  - 1679-85
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir168 [doi]
AB  - Placental malaria infections are caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected red
      blood cells sequestering in the placenta by binding to chondroitin sulfate A,
      mediated by VAR2CSA, a variant of the PfEMP1 family of adhesion antigens. Recent 
      studies have shown that many P. falciparum genomes have multiple genes coding for
      different VAR2CSA proteins, and parasites with >1 var2csa gene appear to be more 
      common in pregnant women with placental malaria than in nonpregnant individuals. 
      We present evidence that, in pregnant women, parasites containing multiple
      var2csa-type genes possess a selective advantage over parasites with a single
      var2csa gene. Accumulation of parasites with multiple copies of the var2csa gene 
      during the course of pregnancy was also correlated with the development of
      antibodies involved in blocking VAR2CSA adhesion. The data suggest that
      multiplicity of var2csa-type genes enables P. falciparum parasites to persist for
      a longer period of time during placental infections, probably because of their
      greater capacity for antigenic variation and evasion of variant-specific immune
      responses.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of malaria among children in southern highland
      Rwanda.
PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased control has produced remarkable reductions of malaria in
      some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, including Rwanda. In the southern highlands,
      near the district capital of Butare (altitude, 1,768 m), a combined community-and
      facility-based survey on Plasmodium infection was conducted early in 2010.
      METHODS: A total of 749 children below five years of age were examined including 
      545 randomly selected from 24 villages, 103 attending the health centre in
      charge, and 101 at the referral district hospital. Clinical, parasitological,
      haematological, and socio-economic data were collected. RESULTS: Plasmodium
      falciparum infection (mean multiplicity, 2.08) was identified by microscopy and
      PCR in 11.7% and 16.7%, respectively; 5.5% of the children had malaria. PCR-based
      P. falciparum prevalence ranged between 0 and 38.5% in the villages, and was
      21.4% in the health centre, and 14.9% in the hospital. Independent predictors of 
      infection included increasing age, low mid-upper arm circumference, absence of
      several household assets, reported recent intake of artemether-lumefantrine, and 
      chloroquine in plasma, measured by ELISA. Self-reported bed net use (58%) reduced
      infection only in univariate analysis. In the communities, most infections were
      seemingly asymptomatic but anaemia was observed in 82% and 28% of children with
      and without parasitaemia, respectively, the effect increasing with parasite
      density, and significant also for submicroscopic infections. CONCLUSIONS:
      Plasmodium falciparum infection in the highlands surrounding Butare, Rwanda, is
      seen in one out of six children under five years of age. The abundance of
      seemingly asymptomatic infections in the community forms a reservoir for
      transmission in this epidemic-prone area. Risk factors suggestive of low
      socio-economic status and insufficient effectiveness of self-reported bed net use
      refer to areas of improvable intervention.

TI  - Piperaquine resistance is associated with a copy number variation on chromosome 5
      in drug-pressured Plasmodium falciparum parasites.
PG  - 3908-16
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01793-10 [doi]
AB  - The combination of piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin has recently become the
      official first-line therapy in several Southeast Asian countries. The
      pharmacokinetic mismatching of these drugs, whose plasma half-lives are ~20 days 
      and ~1 h, respectively, implies that recrudescent or new infections emerging
      shortly after treatment cessation will encounter piperaquine as a monotherapy
      agent. This creates substantial selection pressure for the emergence of
      resistance. To elucidate potential resistance determinants, we subjected cloned
      Plasmodium falciparum Dd2 parasites to continuous piperaquine pressure in vitro
      (47 nM; ~2-fold higher than the Dd2 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)]). The
      phenotype of outgrowth parasites was assayed in two clones, revealing an IC(50)
      against piperaquine of 2.1 muM and 1.7 muM, over 100-fold greater than that of
      the parent. To identify the genetic determinant of resistance, we employed
      comparative whole-genome hybridization analysis. Compared to the Dd2 parent, this
      analysis found (in both resistant clones) a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      in P. falciparum crt (pfcrt), deamplification of an 82-kb region of chromosome 5 
      (that includes pfmdr1), and amplification of an adjacent 63-kb region of
      chromosome 5. Continued propagation without piperaquine selection pressure
      resulted in "revertant" piperaquine-sensitive parasites. These retained the pfcrt
      polymorphism and further deamplified the chromosome 5 segment that encompasses
      pfmdr1; however, these two independently generated revertants both lost the
      neighboring 63-kb amplification. These results suggest that a copy number
      variation event on chromosome 5 (825600 to 888300) is associated with piperaquine
      resistance. Transgene expression studies are underway with individual genes in
      this segment to evaluate their contribution to piperaquine resistance.

TI  - Investigating the host binding signature on the Plasmodium falciparum PfEMP1
      protein family.
PG  - e1002032
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002032 [doi]
AB  - The Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family plays a 
      central role in antigenic variation and cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected
      erythrocytes. PfEMP1 proteins/var genes are classified into three main
      subfamilies (UpsA, UpsB, and UpsC) that are hypothesized to have different roles 
      in binding and disease. To investigate whether these subfamilies have diverged in
      binding specificity and test if binding could be predicted by adhesion domain
      classification, we generated a panel of 19 parasite lines that primarily
      expressed a single dominant var transcript and assayed binding against 12 known
      host receptors. By limited dilution cloning, only UpsB and UpsC var genes were
      isolated, indicating that UpsA var gene expression is rare under in vitro culture
      conditions. Consequently, three UpsA variants were obtained by rosette
      purification and selection with specific monoclonal antibodies to create a more
      representative panel. Binding assays showed that CD36 was the most common
      adhesion partner of the parasite panel, followed by ICAM-1 and TSP-1, and that
      CD36 and ICAM-1 binding variants were highly predicted by adhesion domain
      sequence classification. Binding to other host receptors, including CSA, VCAM-1, 
      HABP1, CD31/PECAM, E-selectin, Endoglin, CHO receptor "X", and Fractalkine, was
      rare or absent. Our findings identify a category of larger PfEMP1 proteins that
      are under dual selection for ICAM-1 and CD36 binding. They also support that the 
      UpsA group, in contrast to UpsB and UpsC var genes, has diverged from binding to 
      the major microvasculature receptor CD36 and likely uses other mechanisms to
      sequester in the microvasculature. These results demonstrate that CD36 and ICAM-1
      have left strong signatures of selection on the PfEMP1 family that can be
      detected by adhesion domain sequence classification and have implications for how
      this family of proteins is specializing to exploit hosts with varying levels of
      anti-malaria immunity.

TI  - A simple, inexpensive device for nucleic acid amplification without
      electricity-toward instrument-free molecular diagnostics in low-resource
      settings.
PG  - e19738
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0019738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming
      increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically
      confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference
      laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases
      that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple,
      instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment.
      One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in 
      LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free
      heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change
      materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess
      the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the
      characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method
      comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques
      are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free 
      heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change
      materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that 
      the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated
      in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly
      suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA)
      heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in 
      development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold
      reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that
      should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.

TI  - Mapping hypoendemic, seasonal malaria in rural Bandarban, Bangladesh: a
      prospective surveillance.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently the Chittagong Hill tracts have been hyperendemic for 
      malaria. A past cross-sectional RDT based survey in 2007 recorded rates of
      approximately 15%. This study was designed to understand the present epidemiology
      of malaria in this region, to monitor and facilitate the uptake of malaria
      intervention activities of the national malaria programme and to serve as an area
      for developing new and innovative control strategies for malaria. METHODS: This
      research field area was established in two rural unions of Bandarban District of 
      Bangladesh north of Bandarban city, which are known to be endemic for malaria due
      to Plasmodium falciparum. The project included the following elements: a) a
      demographic surveillance system including an initial census with updates every
      four months, b) periodic surveys of knowledge attitude and practice, c) a
      geographic information system, d) weekly active and continuous passive
      surveillance for malaria infections using smears, rapid tests and PCR, f) monthly
      mosquito surveillance, and e) daily weather measures. The programme included both
      traditional and molecular methods for detecting malaria as well as lab methods
      for speciating mosquitoes and detecting mosquitoes infected with sporozoites.
      RESULTS: The demographic surveillance enumerated and mapped 20,563 people, 75% of
      which were tribal non-Bengali. The monthly mosquito surveys identified 22
      Anopheles species, eight of which were positive by circumsporozoite ELISA. The
      annual rate of malaria was close to 1% with 85% of cases in the rainy months of
      May-October. Definitive clustering identified in the low transmission season
      persisted during the high transmission season. CONCLUSION: This demographically
      and geographically defined area, near to the Myanmar border, which is also
      hypoendemic for malaria, will be useful for future studies of the epidemiology of
      malaria and for evaluation of strategies for malaria control including new drugs 
      and vaccines.

PG  - 123
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance contributes to the global malaria burden. Plasmodium 
      falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps)
      polymorphisms confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). METHODS: The 
      study assessed the frequency of SP resistance-conferring polymorphisms in
      Plasmodium falciparum-positive samples from two clinical studies in Lambarene.
      Their role on treatment responses and transmission potential was studied in an
      efficacy open-label clinical trial with a 28-day follow-up in 29 children under
      five with uncomplicated malaria. RESULTS: SP was well tolerated by all subjects
      in vivo. Three subjects were excluded from per-protocol analysis. PCR-corrected, 
      12/26 (46%) achieved an adequate clinical and parasitological response, 13/26
      (50%) were late parasitological failures, while 1/26 (4%) had an early treatment 
      failure, resulting in early trial discontinuation. Of 106 isolates, 98 (92%)
      carried the triple mutant dhfr haplotype. Three point mutations were found in
      dhps in a variety of haplotypic configurations. The 437G + 540E double mutant
      allele was found for the first time in Gabon. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high
      prevalence of dhfr triple mutant with some dhps point mutations in Gabon, in line
      with treatment failures observed, and molecular markers of SP resistance should
      be closely monitored.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum transmission and aridity: a Kenyan experience from the dry 
      lands of Baringo and its implications for Anopheles arabiensis control.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ecology of malaria vectors particularly in semi-arid areas of
      Africa is poorly understood. Accurate knowledge on this subject will boost
      current efforts to reduce the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. The
      objective of this study was to describe the dynamics of malaria transmission in
      two model semi-arid sites (Kamarimar and Tirion) in Baringo in Kenya. METHODS:
      Adult mosquitoes were collected indoors by pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) and 
      outdoors by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps and identified to
      species by morphological characteristics. Sibling species of Anopheles gambiae
      complex were further characterized by rDNA. PCR and enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent 
      assays (ELISA) were used to test for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite
      proteins and host blood meal sources respectively. RESULTS: Anopheles arabiensis 
      was not only the most dominant mosquito species in both study sites but also the 
      only sibling species of An. gambiae s.l. present in the area. Other species
      identified in the study area were Anopheles funestus, Anopheles pharoensis and
      Anopheles coustani. For Kamarimar but not Tirion, the human blood index (HBI) for
      light trap samples was significantly higher than for PSC samples (Kamarimar, 0.63
      and 0.11, Tirion, 0.48 and 0.43). The HBI for light trap samples was
      significantly higher in Kamarimar than in Tirion while that of PSC samples was
      significantly higher in Tirion than in Kamarimar. Entomological inoculation rates
      (EIR) were only detected for one month in Kamarimar and 3 months in Tirion. The
      number of houses in a homestead, number of people sleeping in the house, quality 
      of the house, presence or absence of domestic animals, and distance to the animal
      shelter and the nearest larval habitat were significant predictors of An.
      arabiensis occurrence. CONCLUSION: Malaria transmission in the study area is
      seasonal with An. arabiensis as the dominant vector. The fact this species feeds 
      readily on humans and domestic animals suggest that zooprophylaxis may be a
      plausible malaria control strategy in semi-arid areas of Africa. The results also
      suggest that certain household characteristics may increase the risk of malaria
      transmission.

TI  - Establishing the extent of malaria transmission and challenges facing
      pre-elimination in the Republic of Djibouti.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-11-121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries aiming for malaria elimination require a detailed
      understanding of the current intensity of malaria transmission within their
      national borders. National household sample surveys are now being used to define 
      infection prevalence but these are less efficient in areas of exceptionally low
      endemicity. Here we present the results of a national malaria indicator survey in
      the Republic of Djibouti, the first in sub-Saharan Africa to combine
      parasitological and serological markers of malaria, to evaluate the extent of
      transmission in the country and explore the potential for elimination. METHODS: A
      national cross-sectional household survey was undertaken from December 2008 to
      January 2009. A finger prick blood sample was taken from randomly selected
      participants of all ages to examine for parasitaemia using rapid diagnostic tests
      (RDTs) and confirmed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Blood spots were also
      collected on filter paper and subsequently used to evaluate the presence of
      serological markers (combined AMA-1 and MSP-119) of Plasmodium falciparum
      exposure. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors
      for P. falciparum infection and/or exposure. The Getis-Ord G-statistic was used
      to assess spatial heterogeneity of combined infections and serological markers.
      RESULTS: A total of 7151 individuals were tested using RDTs of which only 42
      (0.5%) were positive for P. falciparum infections and confirmed by PCR. Filter
      paper blood spots were collected for 5605 individuals. Of these 4769 showed
      concordant optical density results and were retained in subsequent analysis.
      Overall P. falciparum sero-prevalence was 9.9% (517/4769) for all ages; 6.9%
      (46/649) in children under the age of five years; and 14.2% (76/510) in the
      oldest age group (>/=50 years). The combined infection and/or antibody prevalence
      was 10.5% (550/4769) and varied from 8.1% to 14.1% but overall regional
      differences were not statistically significant (chi2=33.98, p=0.3144). Increasing
      age (p<0.001) and decreasing household wealth status (p<0.001) were significantly
      associated with increasing combined P. falciparum infection and/or antibody
      prevalence. Significant P. falciparum hot spots were observed in Dikhil region.
      CONCLUSION: Malaria transmission in the Republic of Djibouti is very low across
      all regions with evidence of micro-epidemiological heterogeneity and limited
      recent transmission. It would seem that the Republic of Djibouti has a
      biologically feasible set of pre-conditions for elimination, however, the
      operational feasibility and the potential risks to elimination posed by P. vivax 
      and human population movement across the sub-region remain to be properly
      established.

      Banking Card in comparison with frozen liquid blood for detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
PG  - 185-90

AB  - BACKGROUND: Venipuncture sampling in test tubes for detecting malaria parasites
      using PCR assays possesses a number of limitations such as reluctance of
      patients, some difficulties in transportation of blood samples and freezing them 
      for long time. To overcome the mentioned limitations, some approaches have been
      employed by a number of authors. This study was proposed to compare between DNA
      Banking Card (DBC) filter papers containing dried finger-prick blood and
      venipunctured frozen liquid blood. METHODS: A total of 75 specimens was prepared 
      from the equal enrolled individuals using three blood storage approaches; making 
      Geimsa-stained thin and thick smears from each individual to determine the
      malaria-positive or -negative specimens, spotting two to three drops of
      finger-prick blood onto the DBC filter paper, and collecting a 2-ml venous blood 
      sample into EDTA-contained test tube from each individual. A semi-nested
      Multiplex PCR technique with DNA extracted from the two latter sets of specimens 
      was used for plasmodia diagnosis. RESULTS: DNA samples isolated from dried blood 
      spotted on the DBC filter papers resulted in 32 (42.7%) positive and 43 (57.3%)
      negative cases comparable with the results outcome of frozen liquid blood with 35
      (46.7%) positive and 40 (53.3%) negative cases. Statistical analysis revealed
      higher sensitivity for SnM-PCR using DNA from liquid blood with 100% vs. dried
      blood spotted on DBC with 97% but higher specificity for the DBC with 100% vs.
      liquid blood with 95.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results obtained from this
      study to overcome the problems of venipuncture frozen liquid blood sampling,
      replacement of a reliable filter paper for preserving finger-prick blood samples 
      is a trustable and useful facilitator particularly in remote malaria-endemic
      areas.

      dihydrofolate reductase in Plasmodium berghei model.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of drug resistance amongst the human malaria
      Plasmodium species has most commonly been associated with genomic mutation within
      the parasites. This phenomenon necessitates evolutionary predictive studies of
      possible resistance mutations, which may occur when a new drug is introduced.
      Therefore, identification of possible new Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate
      reductase (PfDHFR) mutants that confer resistance to antifolate drugs is
      essential in the process of antifolate anti-malarial drug development. METHODS: A
      system to identify mutations in Pfdhfr gene that confer antifolate drug
      resistance using an animal Plasmodium parasite model was developed. By using
      error-prone PCR and Plasmodium transfection technologies, libraries of Pfdhfr
      mutant were generated and then episomally transfected to Plasmodium berghei
      parasites, from which pyrimethamine-resistant PfDHFR mutants were selected.
      RESULTS: The principal mutation found from this experiment was S108N, coincident 
      with the first pyrimethamine-resistance mutation isolated from the field. A
      transgenic P. berghei, in which endogenous Pbdhfr allele was replaced with the
      mutant PfdhfrS108N, was generated and confirmed to have normal growth rate
      comparing to parental non-transgenic parasite and also confer resistance to
      pyrimethamine. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the power of the transgenic P.
      berghei system to predict drug-resistant Pfdhfr mutations in an in vivo
      parasite/host setting. The system could be utilized for identification of
      possible novel drug-resistant mutants that could arise against new antifolate
      compounds and for prediction the evolution of resistance mutations.

TI  - SYBR Green I and TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methods 
      for the determination of amplification of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug
      resistance-1 gene (pfmdr1).
PG  - 939-42
LID - 10.1645/GE-2792.1 [doi]
AB  - The pfmdr1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein homolog 1, has been shown to be a
      reliable marker of resistance for Plasmodium falciparum related to artesunate and
      mefloquine combination therapy. The aims of this study are to investigate the
      copy number of pfmdr1 in P. falciparum isolates collected from the 4
      malaria-endemic areas of Thailand (Kanchanaburi, Mae Hongson, Ranong, and Tak)
      along the Thailand-Myanmar (Burma) border (Thai-Myanmar border) by using SYBR
      Green I and the standard method TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) and to compare the efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) of SYBR
      Green I with TaqMan RT-quantitative (q)PCR methods in determining pfmdr1 gene
      copy number. Ninety-six blood samples were collected onto filter paper from
      patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria who attended malaria clinics in
      the Kanchanaburi (n = 45), Mae Hongson (n = 18), Ranong (n = 11), and Tak (n =
      22) provinces in Thailand. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood
      spots by using QIAcube automated sample preparation. Pfmdr1 gene copy number was 
      determined by TaqMan (63 samples) and SYBR Green I (96 samples) real-time PCR.
      Seventy-one (74.0%), 14 (14.6%), 10 (10.4%), and 1 (1%) isolates carried 1, 2, 3,
      and 4 pfmdr1 gene copies, respectively. Forty-three of 48 (89.6%), 6 of 11
      (54.5%), and 3 of 4 (75.0%) samples, respectively, showed agreement with results 
      of 1, 2, and 3 pfmdr1 gene copies as determined by both methods. The efficiency
      of SYBR Green I in identifying pfmdr1 gene copy number was found to be
      significantly correlated with that of TaqMan. Considering its simplicity and
      relatively low cost, SYBR Green I RT-qPCR is therefore a promising alternative
      technique for the determination of pfmdr1 copy number.

      Plasmodia in the field.
PG  - e19010
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0019010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, most people are simultaneously infected
      with different parasite clones. Detection of individual clones is hampered when
      their densities fluctuate around the detection limit and, in case of P.
      falciparum, by sequestration during part of their life cycle. This has important 
      implications for measures of levels of infection or for the outcome of clinical
      trials. This study aimed at measuring the detectability of individual P.
      falciparum and P. vivax parasite clones in consecutive samples of the same
      patient and at investigating the impact of sampling strategies on basic
      epidemiological measures such as multiplicity of infection (MOI). METHODS:
      Samples were obtained in a repeated cross-sectional field survey in 1 to 4.5
      years old children from Papua New Guinea, who were followed up in 2-monthly
      intervals over 16 months. At each follow-up visit, two consecutive blood samples 
      were collected from each child at intervals of 24 hours. Samples were genotyped
      for the polymorphic markers msp2 for P. falciparum and msp1F3 and MS16 for P.
      vivax. Observed prevalence and mean MOI estimated from single samples per host
      were compared to combined data from sampling twice within 24 h. FINDINGS AND
      CONCLUSION: Estimated detectability was high in our data set (0.79 [95% CI
      0.76-0.82] for P. falciparum and, depending on the marker, 0.61 [0.58-0.63] or
      0.73 [0.71-0.75] for P. vivax). When genotyping data from sequential samples,
      collected 24 hours apart, were combined, the increase in measured prevalence was 
      moderate, 6 to 9% of all infections were missed on a single day. The effect on
      observed MOI was more pronounced, 18 to 31% of all individual clones were not
      detected in a single bleed. Repeated sampling revealed little difference between 
      detectability of P. falciparum and P. vivax.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0498 [doi]
AB  - Recent reports of reductions in malaria transmission in several African countries
      have resulted in optimism that malaria can be eliminated in parts of Africa where
      it is currently endemic. It is not known whether these trends are global or
      whether they are also present in areas where political instability has hindered
      effective malaria control. We determined malaria parasite carriage and
      age-dependent antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in
      cross-sectional surveys in Apac, northern Uganda that was affected by political
      unrest. Under-five parasite prevalence was 55.8% (115/206) by microscopy and
      71.9% (41/57) by polymerase chain reaction. Plasmodium ovale alone, or as a
      co-infection, was detected in 8.6% (12/139) and Plasmodium malariae in 4.3%
      (6/139) of the infections. Age seroprevalence curves gave no indication of recent
      changes in malaria transmission intensity. Malaria control remains a tremendous
      challenge in areas that have not benefited from large-scale interventions,
      illustrated here by the district of Apac.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spain obtained the official certificate of malaria eradication in
      1964. However, imported malaria cases have been increasing during the last few
      decades in this country. This study aims to describe the clinical and
      epidemiological features of patients diagnosed with malaria on Gran Canaria
      Island. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on case review of all 
      patients diagnosed with malaria microbiologically confirmed from 1993 to 2006, at
      the three referral teaching hospitals on Gran Canaria Island. RESULTS: One
      hundred eighty-four episodes in 181 patients were diagnosed, 170 of them were
      analyzed. Most of them (82%) were travelers. Nearly 15% (14.7%) declared having
      had some chemoprophylaxis, but only half of them completed the treatment. Twenty 
      cases (10.9%) were diagnosed who had just arrived as immigrants, mainly children.
      Malaria was acquired in Africa by 94.7% of the cases and Plasmodium falciparum
      was responsible for the majority of the cases (84.1%). Clinical and
      epidemiological differences were observed among different groups of patients
      formed by their origin and travel purposes. At least one indicator of severe
      malaria was established in 22.9% of the cases. However, global mortality was
      3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria in Gran Canaria Island is imported from endemic areas,
      mainly from African countries, observed mostly among young adult males, but
      clinical and epidemiological features may change among different groups of
      patients. The number of immigrants diagnosed with malaria is increasing in this
      area nowadays.

TI  - Malaria seroprevalence in blood bank donors from endemic and non-endemic areas of

AB  - In Venezuela, a total of 363,466 malaria cases were reported between 1999-2009.
      Several states are experiencing malaria epidemics, increasing the risk of vector 
      and possibly transfusion transmission. We investigated the risk of transfusion
      transmission in blood banks from endemic and non-endemic areas of Venezuela by
      examining blood donations for evidence of malaria infection. For this, commercial
      kits were used to detect both malaria-specific antibodies (all species) and
      malaria antigen (Plasmodium falciparum only) in samples from Venezuelan blood
      donors (n = 762). All samples were further studied by microscopy and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). The antibody results showed that P. falciparum-infected
      patients had a lower sample/cut-off ratio than Plasmodium vivax-infected
      patients. Conversely, a higher ratio for antigen was observed among all P.
      falciparum-infected individuals. Sensitivity and specificity were higher for
      malarial antigens (100 and 99.8%) than for antibodies (82.2 and 97.4%).
      Antibody-positive donors were observed in Caracas, Ciudad Bolivar, Puerto
      Ayacucho and Cumana, with prevalences of 1.02, 1.60, 3.23 and 3.63%,
      respectively. No PCR-positive samples were observed among the donors. However,
      our results show significant levels of seropositivity in blood donors, suggesting
      that more effective measures are required to ensure that transfusion transmission
      does not occur.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriage is associated with subsequent
      Plasmodium vivax relapse after treatment.
PG  - e18716
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018716 [doi]
AB  - Mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections are common in southeast Asia. When
      patients with P. falciparum malaria are treated and followed for several weeks, a
      significant proportion will develop P. vivax malaria. In a combined analysis of
      243 patients recruited to two malaria treatment trials in western Cambodia, 20/43
      (47%) of those with P. falciparum gametocytes on admission developed P. vivax
      malaria by Day 28 of follow-up. The presence of Pf gametocytes on an initial
      blood smear was associated with a 3.5-fold greater rate of vivax parasitemia
      post-treatment (IRR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.0-6.0, p<0.001). The increased rate of
      post-treatment P. vivax infection persisted when correlates of exposure and
      immunity such as a history of malaria, male gender, and age were controlled for
      (IRR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.7, p<0.001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed
      that only a low proportion of subjects (5/55 or 9.1%) who developed vivax during 
      follow-up had detectable Pv parasites in the peripheral blood at baseline.
      Molecular detection of falciparum gametocytes by reverse transcriptase PCR in a
      subset of patients strengthened the observed association, while PCR detection of 
      Pv parasitemia at follow-up was similar to microscopy results. These findings
      suggest that the majority of vivax infections arising after treatment of
      falciparum malaria originate from relapsing liver-stage parasites. In settings
      such as western Cambodia, the presence of both sexual and asexual forms of P.
      falciparum on blood smear at presentation with acute falciparum malaria serves as
      a marker for possible occult P. vivax coinfection and subsequent relapse. These
      patients may benefit from empiric treatment with an 8-aminoquinolone such as
      primaquine.

AB  - Use of the yeast two-hybrid assay to study Plasmodium falciparum protein-protein 
      interactions is limited by poor expression of P. falciparum genes in yeast and
      lack of easily implemented assays to confirm the results. We report here two
      methods to create gene fragments - random fragmentation by partial DNAse I
      digestion and generation of densely overlapping fragments by PCR - that enable
      most portions of P. falciparum genes to be expressed and screened in the yeast
      two-hybrid assay. The PCR-based method is less technically challenging and
      facilitates fine-scale mapping of protein interaction domains. Both approaches
      revealed a putative interaction between PfMyb2 (PF10_0327) and PFC0365w. We
      developed new plasmids to express the proteins in wheat germ extracts and
      confirmed the interaction in both the split-luciferase assay and in
      co-purification experiments with glutathione-S-transferase and HA-tagged
      proteins. The combination of improved yeast two-hybrid screening approaches and
      convenient systems to validate interactions enhances the utility of yeast
      two-hybrid assays for P. falciparum.

AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi can cause severe malaria in adults; however, descriptions of 
      clinical disease in children are lacking. We reviewed case records of children
      (age <15 years) with a malaria diagnosis at Kudat District Hospital, serving a
      largely deforested area of Sabah, Malaysia, during January-November 2009. Sixteen
      children with PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi monoinfection were compared with 14
      children with P. falciparum monoinfection diagnosed by microscopy or PCR. Four
      children with knowlesi malaria had a hemoglobin level at admission of <10.0 g/dL 
      (minimum lowest level 6.4 g/dL). Minimum level platelet counts were lower in
      knowlesi than in falciparum malaria (median 76,500/muL vs. 156,000/mL; p = 0.01).
      Most (81%) children with P. knowlesi malaria received chloroquine and primaquine;
      median parasite clearance time was 2 days (range 1-5 days). P. knowlesi is the
      most common cause of childhood malaria in Kudat. Although infection is generally 
      uncomplicated, anemia is common and thrombocytopenia universal. Transmission
      dynamics in this region require additional investigation.

TI  - Applied genomics: data mining reveals species-specific malaria diagnostic targets
      more sensitive than 18S rRNA.
PG  - 2411-8
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02603-10 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and rapid diagnosis of malaria infections is crucial for implementing
      species-appropriate treatment and saving lives. Molecular diagnostic tools are
      the most accurate and sensitive method of detecting Plasmodium, differentiating
      between Plasmodium species, and detecting subclinical infections. Despite
      available whole-genome sequence data for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, the 
      majority of PCR-based methods still rely on the 18S rRNA gene targets.
      Historically, this gene has served as the best target for diagnostic assays.
      However, it is limited in its ability to detect mixed infections in multiplex
      assay platforms without the use of nested PCR. New diagnostic targets are needed.
      Ideal targets will be species specific, highly sensitive, and amenable to both
      single-step and multiplex PCRs. We have mined the genomes of P. falciparum and P.
      vivax to identify species-specific, repetitive sequences that serve as new PCR
      targets for the detection of malaria. We show that these targets (Pvr47 and
      Pfr364) exist in 14 to 41 copies and are more sensitive than 18S rRNA when
      utilized in a single-step PCR. Parasites are routinely detected at levels of 1 to
      10 parasites/mul. The reaction can be multiplexed to detect both species in a
      single reaction. We have examined 7 P. falciparum strains and 91 P. falciparum
      clinical isolates from Tanzania and 10 P. vivax strains and 96 P. vivax clinical 
      isolates from Venezuela, and we have verified a sensitivity and specificity of
      approximately 100% for both targets compared with a nested 18S rRNA approach. We 
      show that bioinformatics approaches can be successfully applied to identify novel
      diagnostic targets and improve molecular methods for pathogen detection. These
      novel targets provide a powerful alternative molecular diagnostic method for the 
      detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax in conventional or multiplex PCR
      platforms.

      range for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children: comparison of therapeutic
      efficacy with standard dose regimen of artesunate and amodiaquine and

AB  - A new dose regimen of artesunate and amodiaquine (NDRAA) based on age or body
      weight range was compared with standard dose regimen of artesunate and
      amodiaquine (SDRAA) calculated according to body weight and with fixed-dose
      artesunate-amodiaquine (FDAA) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 304 children
      afflicted by malaria aged 15 years or younger. In initial comparison (n = 208),
      children on NDRAA received 1-3 times amodiaquine per kilogram of body weight and 
      1-1.5 times of artesunate per kilogram of body weight compared with those
      receiving SDRAA. Parasite but not fever clearance was significantly faster in
      children who received NDRAA (19.4 +/- 8.4 hours vs. 24.6 +/- 15.5 hours, P =
      0.003). Polymerase chain reaction-uncorrected cure rates on days 28-42 were also 
      significantly higher in children who received NDRAA (P < 0.02 in all cases).
      Therapeutic responses in children younger than 5 years (n = 96) treated with
      NDRAA, FDAA, and AL were similar. Changes in hematocrit values and reported
      adverse events after commencing therapy were similar in those who received NDRAA 
      and SDRAA. All drug regimens were well tolerated. NDRAA based on age or body
      weight range is simple, is therapeutically superior to SDRAA calculated according
      to body weight, and is as efficacious as AL in children younger than 5 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have shown that immunity to infection with Plasmodium falciparum
      can be induced experimentally in malaria-naive volunteers through immunisation by
      bites of infected mosquitoes while simultaneously preventing disease with
      chloroquine prophylaxis. This immunity was associated with parasite-specific
      production of interferon gamma and interleukin 2 by pluripotent effector memory
      cells in vitro. We aim to explore the persistence of protection and immune
      responses in the same volunteers. METHODS: In an open-label study at the Radboud 
      University Nijmegen Medical Centre (Nijmegen, Netherlands), from November to
      December, 2009, we rechallenged previously immune volunteers (28 months after
      immunisation) with the bites of five mosquitoes infected with P falciparum. Newly
      recruited malaria-naive volunteers served as infection controls. Our primary
      outcome was the detection of blood-stage parasitaemia by microscopy. We assessed 
      the kinetics of parasitaemia with real-time quantitative PCR (rtPCR) and recorded
      clinical signs and symptoms. In-vitro production of interferon gamma and
      interleukin 2 by effector memory T cells was studied after stimulation with
      sporozoites and red blood cells infected with P falciparum. Differences in
      cellular immune responses between the study groups were assessed with the
      Mann-Whitney test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
      NCT00757887. FINDINGS: Four of six immune volunteers were microscopically
      negative after rechallenge. rtPCR-based detection of blood-stage parasites in
      these individuals was negative throughout follow-up. Patent parasitaemia was
      delayed in the remaining two immunised volunteers. In-vitro assays showed the
      long-term persistence of parasite-specific pluripotent effector memory T-cell
      responses in protected volunteers. The four protected volunteers reported several
      mild to moderate adverse events, of which the most commonly reported symptom was 
      headache (one to three episodes per volunteer). The two patients with delayed
      patency had adverse events similar to those in the control group. INTERPRETATION:
      Artificially induced immunity lasts longer than generally recorded after natural 
      exposure; providing a new avenue of research into the mechanisms of malaria
      immunity. FUNDING: Dioraphte Foundation.

TI  - Malaria surveillance--United States, 2009.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of
      the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective
      female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United
      States occur among persons who have traveled to areas with ongoing malaria
      transmission. In the United States, cases can occur through exposure to infected 
      blood products, congenital transmission, or local mosquitoborne transmission.
      Malaria surveillance is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and 
      to guide prevention recommendations for travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report
      summarizes cases in persons with onset of illness in 2009 and summarizes trends
      during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood
      film, polymerase chain reaction or rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be
      reported to local and state health departments by health-care providers or
      laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health
      departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria
      Surveillance System (NMSS), National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
      (NNDSS), or direct CDC consults. Data from these reporting systems serve as the
      basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 1,484 cases of malaria,
      including two transfusion-related cases, three possible congenital cases, one
      transplant case and four fatal cases, with an onset of symptoms in 2009 among
      persons in the United States. This number represents an increase of 14% from the 
      1,298 cases reported for 2008. Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and 
      P. ovale were identified in 46%, 11%, 2%, and 2% of cases, respectively. Thirteen
      patients were infected by two or more species. The infecting species was
      unreported or undetermined in 38% of cases. Among the 1,484 cases 1,478 were
      classified as imported. Among the 103 U.S. civilians for whom information on
      chemoprophylaxis use and travel area was known, only 34 (33%) reported that they 
      had followed and adhered to a chemoprophylactic drug regimen recommended by CDC
      for the area to which they had traveled. Nineteen cases were reported in pregnant
      women, among whom none adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Almost 22% of the cases among
      pregnant women were treated with an inappropriate treatment drug regimen, of
      which 39% were among cases with either a P. vivax or P. ovale infection where
      primaquine was not taken. Among all the reasons for travel, travelers visiting
      friends and relatives (VFR) and missionaries were the groups with the lowest
      proportion of chemoprophylexis use. INTERPRETATION: A notable increase in the
      number of malaria cases was reported from 2008 to 2009; however, the number of
      cases in 2009 is consistent with the average number of cases reported during the 
      preceding 4 years. In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired
      infection abroad had not adhered to a chemoprophylaxis regimen that was
      appropriate for the country in which they acquired malaria. Furthermore,
      treatment of malaria, while appropriate for the majority of cases, was
      insufficient for a large number of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, putting
      patients at risk for relapsing malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Decreasing the
      number of malaria cases in subsequent years will require conveying the importance
      of adhering to appropriate preventive measures for malaria specifically targeting
      travelers visiting friends and relatives, missionary, and pregnant populations.
      Clinicians require education on the need to encourage use of malaria prophylaxis 
      and need further information on the appropriate diagnostic and treatment
      guidelines for malaria. Malaria prevention recommendations are available online
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/ or
      http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/malaria.aspx#990). Malaria 
      infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial
      medications appropriate for the individual patient's age and medical history, the
      likely site of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial
      chemoprophylaxis. Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment and 
      contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advisement when needed.
      Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained online
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling the Malaria
      Hotline (770-488-7788).

      in travelers.
PG  - 2191-5
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02156-10 [doi]
AB  - A cytochrome b (cytb) gene quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to
      diagnose malaria in travelers. First, manual and automated DNA extractions were
      compared and automated DNA extraction of 400 mul of blood was found to be more
      efficient. Sensitivity was estimated using the WHO international standard for
      Plasmodium falciparum DNA and compared to that of a previously published qPCR
      targeting the 18S rRNA coding gene (18S qPCR). The limit of detection of the cytb
      qPCR assay was 20 DNA copies (i.e., 1 parasite equivalent) per 400 mul of
      extracted whole blood and was comparable for the two qPCR assays. Both qPCR
      assays were used on blood samples from 265 consecutive patients seen for
      suspicion of malaria. There were no microscopy-positive and qPCR-negative
      samples. Positive cytb qPCR results were observed for 51 samples, and all but 1
      were also 18S qPCR positive. Eight (16%) of these 51 samples were negative by
      microscopic examination. The 8 cytb qPCR-positive and microscopy-negative samples
      were from African patients, 3 of whom had received antimalarial drugs. Three
      non-P. falciparum infections were correctly identified using an additional qPCR
      assay. The absence of PCR inhibitors was tested for by the use of an internal
      control of mouse DNA to allow reliable quantification of circulating DNA. The
      high analytical sensitivity of both qPCR assays combined with automated DNA
      extraction supports its use as a laboratory tool for diagnosis and parasitemia
      determination in emergencies. Whether to treat qPCR-positive and
      microscopy-negative patients remains to be determined.

TI  - Identification and distribution of a GABA receptor mutation conferring dieldrin
      resistance in the malaria vector Anopheles funestus in Africa.
PG  - 484-91
LID - 10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.03.012 [doi]
AB  - Growing problems of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles funestus have intensified 
      efforts to identify alternative insecticides. Many agrochemicals target the GABA 
      receptors, but cross-resistance from dieldrin resistance may preclude their
      introduction. Dieldrin resistance was detected in An. funestus populations from
      West (Burkina Faso) and central (Cameroon) Africa, but populations from East
      (Uganda) and Southern Africa (Mozambique and Malawi) were fully susceptible to
      this insecticide. Partial sequencing of the dieldrin target site, the
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, identified two amino acid substitutions,
      A296S and V327I. The A296S mutation has been associated with dieldrin resistance 
      in other species. The V327I mutations was detected in the resistant sample from
      Burkina Faso and Cameroon and consistently associated with the A296S
      substitution. The full-length of the An. funestus GABA-receptor gene, amplified
      by RT-PCR, generated a sequence of 1674 bp encoding 557 amino acid of the protein
      in An. funestus with 98% similarity to that of Anopheles gambiae. Two diagnostic 
      assays were developed to genotype the A296S mutation (pyrosequencing and
      PCR-RFLP), and use of these assays revealed high frequency of the resistant
      allele in Burkina Faso (60%) and Cameroon (82%), moderate level in Benin (16%)
      while low frequency or absence of the mutation was observed respectively in
      Uganda (7.5%) or 0% in Malawi and Mozambique. The distribution of the Rdl(R)
      mutation in An. funestus populations in Africa suggests extensive barriers to
      gene flow between populations from different regions.

TI  - Genetic evidence strongly support an essential role for PfPV1 in
      intra-erythrocytic growth of P. falciparum.

AB  - Upon invading the host erythrocyte, the human malaria parasite P. falciparum
      lives and replicates within a membrane bound compartment referred to as the
      parasitophorous vacuole. Recently, interest in this compartment and its protein
      content has grown, due to the important roles these play in parasite egress and
      protein traffic to the host cell. Surprisingly, the function of many proteins
      within this compartment has not been experimentally addressed. Here, we study the
      importance of one of these proteins, termed PfPV1, for intra-erythrocytic
      parasite survival. Despite numerous attempts to inactivate the gene encoding
      PfPV1, we were unable to recover deletion mutants. Control experiments verified
      that the pv1 gene locus was per se open for gene targeting experiments, allowing 
      us to exclude technical limitations in our experimental strategy. Our data
      provide strong genetic evidence that PfPV1 is essential for survival of blood
      stage P. falciparum, and further highlight the importance of parasitophorous
      vacuole proteins in this part of the parasite's life cycle.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum msp1, msp2 and glurp allele frequency and diversity in
      sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of anti-malarial drugs is assessed over a period of
      28-63 days (depending on the drugs' residence time) following initiation of
      treatment in order to capture late failures. However, prolonged follow-up
      increases the likelihood of new infections depending on transmission intensity.
      Therefore, molecular genotyping of highly polymorphic regions of Plasmodium
      falciparum msp1, msp2 and glurp loci is usually carried out to distinguish
      recrudescence (true failures) from new infections. This tool has now been adopted
      as an integral part of anti-malarial efficacy studies and clinical trials.
      However, there are concerns over its utility and reliability because conclusions 
      drawn from molecular typing depend on the genetic profile of the respective
      parasite populations, but this profile is not systematically documented in most
      endemic areas. This study presents the genetic diversity of P. falciparum msp1,
      msp2 and glurp markers in selected sub-Saharan Africa countries with varying
      levels of endemicity namely Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Sao Tome. 
      METHODS: A total 780 baseline (Day 0) blood samples from children less than seven
      years, recruited in a randomized controlled clinical trials done between 1996 and
      2000 were genotyped. DNA was extracted; allelic frequency and diversity were
      investigated by PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis for msp2 and fragment
      sizing by a digitalized gel imager for msp1 and glurp. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:
      Plasmodium falciparum msp1, msp2 and glurp markers were highly polymorphic with
      low allele frequencies. A total of 17 msp1 genotypes [eight MAD20-, one RO33- and
      eight K1-types]; 116 msp2 genotypes [83 3D7 and 33 FC27- types] and 14 glurp
      genotypes were recorded. All five sites recorded very high expected
      heterozygosity (HE) values (0.68 - 0.99). HE was highest in msp2 locus (HE=0.99),
      and lowest for msp1 (HE=0.68) (P<0.0001). The genetic diversity and allelic
      frequency recorded were independent of transmission intensity (P=0.84, P=0.25
      respectively. A few genotypes had particularly high frequencies; however the most
      abundant showed only a 4% probability that a new infection would share the same
      genotype as the baseline infection. This is unlikely to confound the distinction 
      of recrudescence from new infection, particularly if more than one marker is used
      for genotyping. Hence, this study supports the use of msp1, msp2 and glurp in
      malaria clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa to discriminate new from
      recrudescent infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the contribution of paediatric HIV and of HIV
      co-infections to admissions to a hospital in Moshi, Tanzania, using contemporary 
      laboratory methods. METHODS: During 1 year, we enrolled consecutively admitted
      patients aged >/=2 months and <13 years with current or recent fever. All
      patients underwent standardized clinical history taking, a physical examination
      and HIV antibody testing; standard aerobic blood cultures and malaria film were
      also done, and hospital outcome was recorded. Early infant HIV diagnosis by HIV-1
      RNA PCR was performed on those aged <18 months. HIV-infected patients also
      received serum cryptococcal antigen testing and had their CD4-positive
      T-lymphocyte count and percent determined. RESULTS: A total of 467 patients were 
      enrolled whose median age was 2 years (range 2 months-13 years); Of those
      patients, 57.2% were female and 12.2% were HIV-infected. Admission clinical
      diagnosis of HIV disease was made in 10.7% and of malaria in 60.4%. Of blood
      cultures, 5.8% grew pathogens; of these 25.9% were Salmonella enterica (including
      6 Salmonella Typhi) and 22.2%Streptococcus pneumoniae. Plasmodium falciparum was 
      identified on blood film of 1.3%. HIV infection was associated with S. pneumoniae
      (odds ratio 25.7, 95% CI 2.8, 234.0) bloodstream infection (BSI), but there was
      no evidence of an association with Escherichia coli or P. falciparum; Salmonella 
      Typhi BSI occurred only among HIV-uninfected participants. The sensitivity and
      specificity of an admission clinical diagnosis of malaria were 100% and 40.3%;
      and for an admission diagnosis of bloodstream infection, they were 9.1% and
      86.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of
      bloodstream infection among paediatric admissions in Tanzania and is closely
      associated with HIV infection. Malaria was over-diagnosed clinically, whereas
      invasive bacterial disease was underestimated. HIV and HIV co-infections
      contribute to a substantial proportion of paediatric febrile admissions,
      underscoring the value of routine HIV testing.

AB  - Prompt and accurate diagnosis of malaria is the key to prevent disease morbidity 
      and mortality. This study was carried out to evaluate diagnostic performance of 3
      commercial rapid detection tests (RDTs), i.e., Malaria Antigen Pf/Pan, Malaria
      Ag-Pf, and Malaria Ag-Pv tests, in comparison with the microscopic and PCR
      methods. A total of 460 blood samples microscopically positive for Plasmodium
      falciparum (211 samples), P. vivax (218), mixed with P. falciparum and P. vivax
      (30), or P. ovale (1), and 124 samples of healthy subjects or patients with other
      fever-related infections, were collected. The sensitivities of Malaria Ag-Pf and 
      Malaria Antigen Pf/Pan compared with the microscopic method for P. falciparum or 
      P. vivax detection were 97.6% and 99.0%, or 98.6% and 99.0%, respectively. The
      specificities of Malaria Ag-Pf, Malaria Ag-Pv, and Malaria Antigen Pf/Pan were
      93.3%, 98.8%, and 94.4%, respectively. The sensitivities of Malaria Ag-Pf,
      Malaria Antigen Pf/Pan, and microscopic method, when PCR was used as a reference 
      method for P. falciparum or P. vivax detection were 91.8%, 100%, and 96.7%, or
      91.9%, 92.6%, and 97.3%, respectively. The specificities of Malaria Ag-Pf,
      Malaria Ag-Pv, Malaria Antigen Pf/Pan, and microscopic method were 66.2%, 92.7%, 
      73.9%, and 78.2%, respectively. Results indicated that the diagnostic
      performances of all the commercial RDTs are satisfactory for application to
      malaria diagnosis.

PG  - 77
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-77 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular
      patterns and their activation leads to the induction of effector genes involving 
      inflammatory cytokines that may have contribute to controlling parasite growth
      and disease pathogenesis. The current immunogenetic study was designed to analyse
      the key components of innate immunity, TLRs and TIRAP (Toll-interleukin-1
      receptor domain-containing adaptor protein), also known as MAL (MYD88
      adaptor-like), in Iranian patients with mild malaria. METHODS: The tlr-4 (D299G
      and T399I), tlr-9 (T-1486C and T-1237C) and tirap (S180L) genes were assessed in 
      640 Baluchi individuals (320 Plasmodium falciparum-infected and 320 non-infected,
      median age of 28 years) from malaria-endemic regions using polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. RESULTS:
      Common tlr-4 SNPs and promoter SNPs of tlr-9 were distributed among P.
      falciparum-infected and non-infected groups (P > 0.05) that showed no association
      of these variants with mild clinical manifestation. The comparison of the tirap
      S180L genotypes between patients with mild malaria and those healthy individuals 
      showed that the frequency of heterozygosity was significantly higher in infected 
      than non-infected individuals (33.8 vs. 25.6; OR, 1.479; 95% CI, 1.051-2.081; P =
      0.024). The result also revealed a significant association of tirap S180L (P <
      0.05) with development of mild malaria, which is common in Baluchi populations,
      who are living in malaria hypoendemic region of Iran but not in African
      populations (0%-6%). CONCLUSION: These data point towards the need for addressing
      the exact role of TLRs in contributing to human genetic factors in malaria
      susceptibility/resistance/severity within different malaria settings in the
      world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used
      in treatment of falciparum and vivax malaria in Nepal. Recently, resistance to
      both drugs have necessitated a change towards artemisinin combination therapy
      (ACT) against Plasmodium falciparum in highly endemic areas. However, SP is still
      used against P. falciparum infections in low endemic areas while CQ is used in
      suspected cases in areas with lack of diagnostic facilities. This study examines 
      the prevalence of molecular markers of CQ and SP resistance in P. falciparum and 
      Plasmodium vivax to determine if high levels of in vivo resistance are reflected 
      at molecular level as well. METHODS: Finger prick blood samples (n=189) were
      collected from malaria positive patients from two high endemic districts and
      analysed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the resistance related
      genes of P. falciparum and P. vivax for CQ (Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pvmdr1) and SP
      (Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pvdhfr), using various PCR-based methods. RESULTS AND
      DISCUSSION: Positive P. vivax and P. falciparum infections were identified by PCR
      in 92 and 41 samples respectively. However, some of these were negative in
      subsequent PCRs. Based on a few P. falciparum samples, the molecular level of CQ 
      resistance in P. falciparum was high since nearly all parasites had the Pfcrt
      mutant haplotypes CVIET (55%) or SVMNT (42%), though frequency of the Pfmdr1 wild
      type haplotype was relatively low (35%). Molecular level of SP resistance in P.
      falciparum was found to be high. The most prevalent Pfdhfr haplotype was double
      mutant CNRNI (91%), while frequency of Pfdhps double mutant SGEAA and AGEAA were 
      38% and 33% respectively. Combined, the frequency of quadruple mutations
      (CNRNI-SGEAA/AGEAA) was 63%. Based on P. vivax samples, low CQ and SP resistance 
      were most likely due to low prevalence of Pvmdr1 Y976F mutation (5%) and absence 
      of triple/quadruple mutations in Pvdhfr. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the limited number
      of samples, prevalence of CQ and SP resistance at molecular levels in the
      population in the study area were determined as high in P. falciparum and low in 
      P. vivax. Therefore, CQ could still be used in the treatment of P. vivax
      infections, but this remains to be tested in vivo while the change to ACT for P. 
      falciparum seems justified.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the malaria prevalence by microscopy, antigen detection 
      and nucleic acid detection in a defined subpopulation in a Plasmodium
      falciparum-endemic region during the peak transmission season. METHODS: Blood
      specimens were collected in a cross-sectional study involving children aged 5-10 
      years (n = 195) presenting with acute fever to two clinics in Western Kenya. All 
      specimens underwent microscopy, HRP2 and aldolase antigen detection by enzyme
      immunoassay (EIA), parasite-specific DNA and total nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) by 
      real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Microscopy
      detected 65/195 cases of malaria infection [95% confidence interval (CI) 52-78]. 
      HRP2 and aldolase EIA had similar sensitivity levels detecting antigen in 65/195 
      (95% CI, 52-78) and 57/195 (95% CI, 45-70) cases. Discordants in antigen
      detection vs. microscopy occurred at <470 parasites/mul and <4900 parasites/mul
      for HRP2 and aldolase, respectively. Detection of total nucleic acid allowed a 3 
      log lower limit of detection than just DNA detection by real-time PCR in vitro.
      In clinical specimens, 114/195 (95% CI, 100-127) were qPCR positive (DNA), and
      187/195 (95% CI, 179-191) were qRT-PCR positive (DNA plus RNA). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infection was significantly higher when
      detecting total nucleic acid than just DNA in this outpatient population during
      the high transmission season. Defining standards for submicroscopic infection
      will be important for control programmes, diagnostics development efforts and
      molecular epidemiology studies.

      real-time PCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study describes the use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      as a source of DNA for Plasmodium species-specific real-time PCR. METHODS: First,
      the best method to recover DNA from RDTs was investigated and then the
      applicability of this DNA extraction method was assessed on 12 different RDT
      brands. Finally, two RDT brands (OptiMAL Rapid Malaria Test and SDFK60 malaria Ag
      Plasmodium falciparum/Pan test) were comprehensively evaluated on a panel of
      clinical samples submitted for routine malaria diagnosis at ITM. DNA
      amplification was done with the 18S rRNA real-time PCR targeting the four
      Plasmodium species. Results of PCR on RDT were compared to those obtained by PCR 
      on whole blood samples. RESULTS: Best results were obtained by isolating DNA from
      the proximal part of the nitrocellulose component of the RDT strip with a simple 
      DNA elution method. The PCR on RDT showed a detection limit of 0.02 asexual
      parasites/mul, which was identical to the same PCR on whole blood. For all 12 RDT
      brands tested, DNA was detected except for one brand when a low parasite density 
      sample was applied. In RDTs with a plastic seal covering the nitrocellulose
      strip, DNA extraction was hampered. PCR analysis on clinical RDT samples
      demonstrated correct identification for single species infections for all RDT
      samples with asexual parasites of P. falciparum (n = 60), Plasmodium vivax (n =
      10), Plasmodium ovale (n = 10) and Plasmodium malariae (n = 10). Samples with
      only gametocytes were detected in all OptiMAL and in 10 of the 11 SDFK60 tests.
      None of the negative samples (n = 20) gave a signal by PCR on RDT. With PCR on
      RDT, higher Ct-values were observed than with PCR on whole blood, with a mean
      difference of 2.68 for OptiMAL and 3.53 for SDFK60. Mixed infections were
      correctly identified with PCR on RDT in 4/5 OptiMAL tests and 2/5 SDFK60 tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: RDTs are a reliable source of DNA for Plasmodium real-time PCR. This
      study demonstrates the best method of RDT fragment sampling for a wide range of
      RDT brands in combination with a simple and low cost extraction method, allowing 
      RDT quality control.

TI  - Efficacy and effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine after initial and repeated 
      treatment in children <5 years of age with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in rural Tanzania: a randomized trial.
PG  - 873-82
LID - 10.1093/cid/cir066 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine, which is the most widely used artemisinin-based
      combination therapy in Africa, against Plasmodium falciparum malaria during an
      extended follow-up period after initial and repeated treatment. METHODS: We
      performed an open-label randomized trial of artemether-lumefantrine with
      supervised (n=180) and unsupervised intake (n=179) in children <5 years of age
      with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in rural Tanzania. Recurrent infections
      between day 14 and day 56 were retreated within the same study arm. Main end
      points were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected cure rates by day 56 and
      day 42 after initial and repeated treatment, respectively, as estimated by
      survival analysis. RESULTS: The PCR-corrected cure rate after initial treatment
      was 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.2%-99.4%) after supervised and 95.1% 
      (95% CI, 90.7%-98.1%) after unsupervised intake (P=.29). After retreatment of
      recurrent infections, the cure rates were 92.9% (95% CI, 81.8%-97.3%) and 97.6%
      (95% CI, 89.3%-98.8%), respectively (P=.58). Reinfections occurred in 46.9% (82
      of 175) versus 50.9 % of the patients (relative risk [RR], 0.92 [95% CI,
      0.74-1.14]; P=.46) after initial therapy and 32.4% (24 of 74) versus 39.0% (32 of
      82) (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.54-1.27]; P=.39) after retreatment. Median blood
      lumefantrine concentrations in supervised and unsupervised patients on day 7 were
      304 versus 194 ng/mL (P<.001) after initial treatment and 253 versus 164 ng/mL
      (P=.001) after retreatment. Vomiting was the most commonly reported drug-related 
      adverse event (in 1% of patients) after both initial and repeated treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Artemether-lumefantrine was highly efficacious even after
      unsupervised administration, despite significantly lower lumefantrine
      concentrations, compared with concentration achieved with supervised intake, and 
      was well-tolerated and safe after initial and repeated treatment. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - The identification of Plasmodium species in Anopheles mosquitoes is an integral
      component of malaria control programs. We developed a new assay to identify
      Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium vivax variants.
      Specific primers were designed to hybridize to CS gene-specific regions.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (RFLP) were used to distinguish the P. vivax variants VK210, VK247, and P.
      vivax-like. The new PCR-RFLP assay revealed good agreement when compared with a
      nested PCR using artificially infected Anopheles mosquitoes. This sensitive
      PCR-RFLP method can be useful when detection of Plasmodium species and P. vivax
      variants is required and may be employed to improve the understanding of malaria 
      transmission dynamics by Anopheles species.

      sensu lato mosquitoes were collected resting indoors. Samples were analyzed for
      insecticide susceptibility, species identification, and Plasmodium sporozoite
      infection. Molecular and biochemical assays were conducted to characterize
      insecticide resistance mechanisms. The malaria vector A. gambiae S-form was the
      only mosquito species identified, and it had a high Plasmodium falciparum
      infection rate (9.6%). Multiple insecticide resistance was detected in this
      population with full susceptibility to only one insecticide class, the
      organophosphates. Dieldrin and DDT resistance was mainly attributed to
      target-site resistance (the Rdl and L1014F/L1014S kdr mutations respectively),
      whereas pyrethroid resistance was mainly attributed to P450 metabolic
      enzyme-mediated detoxification in addition to kdr. The role of various
      insecticide resistance mechanisms revealed a complex association between
      metabolic detoxification and reduced target-site sensitivity.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted malaria: case report of asymptomatic donor harboring
      Plasmodium malariae.
PG  - 55-9
LID - S0036-46652011000100010 [pii]
AB  - Malaria in Brazil is endemic in the Amazon region, but autochthonous cases with
      low parasitaemia occur in the Atlantic Forest area of the country. According to
      Brazilian legislation no test is mandatory for blood donors from non-endemic
      areas. However if they have traveled to malaria transmission regions they are
      deferred for six months before they can donate. This report describes a
      transfusion-transmitted malaria case in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where one recipient
      received infected blood and developed the disease. He lived in Sao Paulo and had 
      no previous transfusion or trips to endemic areas, including those of low
      endemicity, such as Atlantic Forest. Thick blood smears confirmed Plasmodium
      malariae. All donors lived in Sao Paulo and one of them (Donor 045-0) showed
      positive hemoscopy and PCR. This asymptomatic donor had traveled to Juquia, in
      the Atlantic Forest area of S ao Paulo State, where sporadic cases of
      autochthonous malaria are described. DNA assay revealed P. malariae in the
      donor's (Donor 045-0) blood. Serum archives of the recipient and of all blood
      donors were analyzed by ELISA using both P. vivax and P. falciparum antigens, and
      IFAT with P. malariae. Donor 045-0's serum was P. malariae IFAT positive and the 
      P. vivax ELISA was reactive. In addition, two out of 44 donors' archive sera were
      also P. vivax ELISA reactive. All sera were P. falciparum ELISA negative. This
      case suggests the need of reviewing donor selection criteria and deferral
      strategies to prevent possible cases of transfusion-transmitted malaria.

TI  - Effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine provided by community health workers in 
      under-five children with uncomplicated malaria in rural Tanzania: an open label
      prospective study.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-64 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home-management of malaria (HMM) strategy improves early access of
      anti-malarial medicines to high-risk groups in remote areas of sub-Saharan
      Africa. However, limited data are available on the effectiveness of using
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) within the HMM strategy. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine (AL),
      presently the most favoured ACT in Africa, in under-five children with
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tanzania, when provided by
      community health workers (CHWs) and administered unsupervised by parents or
      guardians at home. METHODS: An open label, single arm prospective study was
      conducted in two rural villages with high malaria transmission in Kibaha
      District, Tanzania. Children presenting to CHWs with uncomplicated fever and a
      positive rapid malaria diagnostic test (RDT) were provisionally enrolled and
      provided AL for unsupervised treatment at home. Patients with microscopy
      confirmed P. falciparum parasitaemia were definitely enrolled and reviewed weekly
      by the CHWs during 42 days. Primary outcome measure was PCR corrected
      parasitological cure rate by day 42, as estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00454961.
      RESULTS: A total of 244 febrile children were enrolled between March-August 2007.
      Two patients were lost to follow up on day 14, and one patient withdrew consent
      on day 21. Some 141/241 (58.5%) patients had recurrent infection during
      follow-up, of whom 14 had recrudescence. The PCR corrected cure rate by day 42
      was 93.0% (95% CI 88.3%-95.9%). The median lumefantrine concentration was
      statistically significantly lower in patients with recrudescence (97 ng/mL [IQR
      0-234]; n = 10) compared with reinfections (205 ng/mL [114-390]; n = 92), or no
      parasite reappearance (217 [121-374] ng/mL; n = 70; p </= 0.046). CONCLUSIONS:
      Provision of AL by CHWs for unsupervised malaria treatment at home was highly
      effective, which provides evidence base for scaling-up implementation of HMM with
      AL in Tanzania.

TI  - Cloning of the repertoire of individual Plasmodium falciparum var genes using
      transformation associated recombination (TAR).
PG  - e17782
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0017782 [doi]
AB  - One of the major virulence factors of the malaria causing parasite is the
      Plasmodium falciparum encoded erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). It is
      translocated to It the membrane of infected erythrocytes and expressed from
      approximately 60 var genes in a mutually exclusive manner. Switching of var genes
      allows the parasite to alter functional and antigenic properties of infected
      erythrocytes, to escape the immune defense and to establish chronic infections.
      We have developed an efficient method for isolating VAR genes from telomeric and 
      other genome locations by adapting transformation-associated recombination (TAR) 
      cloning, which can then be analyzed and sequenced. For this purpose, three
      plasmids each containing a homologous sequence representing the upstream regions 
      of the group A, B, and C var genes and a sequence homologous to the conserved
      acidic terminal segment (ATS) of var genes were generated. Co-transfection with
      P. falciparum strain ITG2F6 genomic DNA in yeast cells yielded 200 TAR clones.
      The relative frequencies of clones from each group were not biased. Clones were
      screened by PCR, as well as Southern blotting, which revealed clones missed by
      PCR due to sequence mismatches with the primers. Selected clones were transformed
      into E. coli and further analyzed by RFLP and end sequencing. Physical analysis
      of 36 clones revealed 27 distinct types potentially representing 50% of the var
      gene repertoire. Three clones were selected for sequencing and assembled into
      single var gene containing contigs. This study demonstrates that it is possible
      to rapidly obtain the repertoire of var genes from P. falciparum within a single 
      set of cloning experiments. This technique can be applied to individual isolates 
      which will provide a detailed picture of the diversity of var genes in the field.
      This is a powerful tool to overcome the obstacles with cloning and assembly of
      multi-gene families by simultaneously cloning each member.

TI  - Characterization of dihydrofolate reductases from multiple strains of Plasmodium 
      falciparum using mathematical descriptors of their inhibitors.
PG  - 440-53
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201000111 [doi]
AB  - Two classes of graph-theoretic molecular descriptors, viz., topological indices
      (TIs) and atom pairs (APs), have been used to derive high-quality quantitative
      structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for inhibitors of dihydrofolate
      reductases (DHFRs) isolated from the wild and four mutant strains of Plasmodium
      falciparum. Of the three methods used for QSAR formulation, viz.,
      principal-components regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), and ridge
      regression (RR), the RR method outperformed the other two. Cohen's kappa values, 
      based on the overlap of significant and insignificant structural descriptors
      calculated for the QSAR development, show that DHFR from the wild strain is
      substantially different from the four mutant strains. The differential QSAR
      approach reported in this study can be used in protocols for the development of
      drugs to combat drug-resistant pathogens arising continuously in nature due to
      mutations. The pairwise kappa values in conjunction with appropriate drug targets
      and their corresponding set of ligands may be a useful tool in gauging the
      evolving mutual similarities and dissimilarities of pathogenic organisms from
      purely computed mathematical descriptors of the ligands.

TI  - PvRON2, a new Plasmodium vivax rhoptry neck antigen.
PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-60 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhoptries are specialized organelles from parasites belonging to the 
      phylum Apicomplexa; they secrete their protein content during invasion of host
      target cells and are sorted into discrete subcompartments within rhoptry neck or 
      bulb. This distribution is associated with these proteins' role in tight junction
      (TJ) and parasitophorous vacuole (PV) formation, respectively. METHODS:
      Plasmodium falciparum RON2 amino acid sequence was used as bait for screening the
      codifying gene for the homologous protein in the Plasmodium vivax genome. Gene
      synteny, as well as identity and similarity values, were determined for ron2 and 
      its flanking genes among P. falciparum, P. vivax and other malarial parasite
      genomes available at PlasmoDB and Sanger Institute databases. Pvron2 gene
      transcription was determined by RT-PCR of cDNA obtained from the P. vivax VCG-1
      strain. Protein expression and localization were assessed by Western blot and
      immunofluorescence using polyclonal anti-PvRON2 antibodies. Co-localization was
      confirmed using antibodies directed towards specific microneme and rhoptry neck
      proteins. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The first P. vivax rhoptry neck protein (named 
      here PvRON2) has been identified in this study. PvRON2 is a 2,204 residue-long
      protein encoded by a single 6,615 bp exon containing a hydrophobic signal
      sequence towards the amino-terminus, a transmembrane domain towards the
      carboxy-terminus and two coiled coil alpha-helical motifs; these are
      characteristic features of several previously described vaccine candidates
      against malaria. This protein also contains two tandem repeats within the
      interspecies variable sequence possibly involved in evading a host's immune
      system. PvRON2 is expressed in late schizonts and localized in rhoptry necks
      similar to what has been reported for PfRON2, which suggests its participation
      during target cell invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The identification and partial
      characterization of the first P. vivax rhoptry neck protein are described in the 
      present study. This protein is homologous to PfRON2 which has previously been
      shown to be associated with PfAMA-1, suggesting a similar role for PvRON2.

      in endemic areas. Asymptomatic multiclonal P. falciparum infections are common
      and may predict host protection. Here, we have investigated the effect of
      clearing asymptomatic infections on the risk of clinical malaria. METHODS:
      Malaria episodes were continuously monitored in 405 children (1-6 years) in an
      area of moderate transmission, coastal Kenya. Blood samples collected on four
      occasions were assessed by genotyping the polymorphic P. falciparum merozoite
      surface protein 2 using fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Following 
      the second survey, asymptomatic infections were cleared with a full course of
      dihydroartemisinin. RESULTS: Children who were parasite negative by PCR had a
      lower risk of subsequent malaria regardless of whether treatment had been given. 
      Children with >/= 2 clones had a reduced risk of febrile malaria compared with 1 
      clone after clearance of asymptomatic infections, but not if asymptomatic
      infections were not cleared. Multiclonal infection was associated with an
      increased risk of re-infection after drug treatment. However, among the children 
      who were re-infected, multiclonal infections were associated with a shift from
      clinical malaria to asymptomatic parasitaemia. CONCLUSION: The number of clones
      was associated with exposure as well as blood stage immunity. These effects were 
      distinguished by clearing asymptomatic infection with anti-malarials. Exposure to
      multiple P. falciparum infections is associated with protective immunity, but
      there appears to be an additional effect in untreated multiclonal infections that
      offsets this protective effect.

TI  - Malaria immunoepidemiology in low transmission: correlation of infecting genotype
      and immune response to domains of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein
      3.
PG  - 2070-8
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01332-10 [doi]
AB  - Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a major cause of global infant
      mortality, and no effective vaccine currently exists. Multiple potential vaccine 
      targets have been identified, and immunoepidemiology studies have played a major 
      part in assessing those candidates. When such studies are carried out in
      high-transmission settings, individuals are often superinfected with complex
      mixtures of genetically distinct P. falciparum types, making it impossible to
      directly correlate the genotype of the infecting antigen with the antibody
      response. In contrast, in regions of low transmission P. falciparum infections
      are often genetically simple, and direct comparison of infecting genotype and
      antigen-specific immune responses is possible. As a test of the utility of this
      approach, responses against several domains and allelic variants of the vaccine
      candidate P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (PfMSP3) were tested in serum
      samples collected near Iquitos, Peru. Antibodies recognizing both the conserved
      C-terminal and the more variable N-terminal domain were identified, but
      anti-N-terminal responses were more prevalent, of higher titers, and primarily of
      cytophilic subclasses. Comparing antibody responses to different PfMSP3 variants 
      with the PfMSP3 genotype present at the time of infection showed that
      anti-N-terminal responses were largely allele class specific, but there was some 
      evidence for responses that cross-reacted across allele classes. Evidence for
      cross-reactive responses was much stronger when variants within one allele class 
      were tested, which has implications for the rational development of
      genotype-transcending PfMSP3-based vaccines.

TI  - Targeted disruption of py235ebp-1: invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium yoelii 
      using an alternative Py235 erythrocyte binding protein.
PG  - e1001288
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001288 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium yoelii YM asexual blood stage parasites express multiple members of
      the py235 gene family, part of the super-family of genes including those coding
      for Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding proteins and Plasmodium falciparum RH
      proteins. We previously identified a Py235 erythrocyte binding protein
      (Py235EBP-1, encoded by the PY01365 gene) that is recognized by protective mAb
      25.77. Proteins recognized by a second protective mAb 25.37 have been identified 
      by mass spectrometry and are encoded by two genes, PY01185 and PY05995/PY03534.
      We deleted the PY01365 gene and examined the phenotype. The expression of the
      members of the py235 family in both the WT and gene deletion parasites was
      measured by quantitative RT-PCR and RNA-Seq. py235ebp-1 expression was
      undetectable in the knockout parasite, but transcription of other members of the 
      family was essentially unaffected. The knockout parasites continued to react with
      mAb 25.77; and the 25.77-binding proteins in these parasites were the PY01185 and
      PY05995/PY03534 products. The PY01185 product was also identified as erythrocyte 
      binding. There was no clear change in erythrocyte invasion profile suggesting
      that the PY01185 gene product (designated PY235EBP-2) is able to fulfill the role
      of EBP-1 by serving as an invasion ligand although the molecular details of its
      interaction with erythrocytes have not been examined. The PY01365, PY01185, and
      PY05995/PY03534 genes are part of a distinct subset of the py235 family. In P.
      falciparum, the RH protein genes are under epigenetic control and expression
      correlates with binding to distinct erythrocyte receptors and specific invasion
      pathways, whereas in P. yoelii YM all the genes are expressed and deletion of one
      does not result in upregulation of another. We propose that simultaneous
      expression of multiple Py235 ligands enables invasion of a wide range of host
      erythrocytes even in the presence of antibodies to one or more of the proteins
      and that this functional redundancy at the protein level gives the parasite
      phenotypic plasticity in the absence of differences in gene expression.

TI  - Expression of P. falciparum var genes involves exchange of the histone variant
      H2A.Z at the promoter.
PG  - e1001292
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001292 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum employs antigenic variation to evade the human immune
      response by switching the expression of different variant surface antigens
      encoded by the var gene family. Epigenetic mechanisms including histone
      modifications and sub-nuclear compartmentalization contribute to transcriptional 
      regulation in the malaria parasite, in particular to control antigenic variation.
      Another mechanism of epigenetic control is the exchange of canonical histones
      with alternative variants to generate functionally specialized chromatin domains.
      Here we demonstrate that the alternative histone PfH2A.Z is associated with the
      epigenetic regulation of var genes. In many eukaryotic organisms the histone
      variant H2A.Z mediates an open chromatin structure at promoters and facilitates
      diverse levels of regulation, including transcriptional activation. Throughout
      the asexual, intraerythrocytic lifecycle of P. falciparum we found that the P.
      falciparum ortholog of H2A.Z (PfH2A.Z) colocalizes with histone modifications
      that are characteristic of transcriptionally-permissive euchromatin, but not with
      markers of heterochromatin. Consistent with this finding, antibodies to PfH2A.Z
      co-precipitate the permissive modification H3K4me3. By
      chromatin-immunoprecipitation we show that PfH2A.Z is enriched in nucleosomes
      around the transcription start site (TSS) in both transcriptionally active and
      silent stage-specific genes. In var genes, however, PfH2A.Z is enriched at the
      TSS only during active transcription in ring stage parasites. Thus, in contrast
      to other genes, temporal var gene regulation involves histone variant exchange at
      promoter nucleosomes. Sir2 histone deacetylases are important for var gene
      silencing and their yeast ortholog antagonises H2A.Z function in subtelomeric
      yeast genes. In immature P. falciparum parasites lacking Sir2A or Sir2B high var 
      transcription levels correlate with enrichment of PfH2A.Z at the TSS. As Sir2A
      knock out parasites mature the var genes are silenced, but PfH2A.Z remains
      enriched at the TSS of var genes; in contrast, PfH2A.Z is lost from the TSS of
      de-repressed var genes in mature Sir2B knock out parasites. This result indicates
      that PfH2A.Z occupancy at the active var promoter is antagonized by PfSir2A
      during the intraerythrocytic life cycle. We conclude that PfH2A.Z contributes to 
      the nucleosome architecture at promoters and is regulated dynamically in active
      var genes.

AB  - African Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma linked to 
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Malaria biomarkers related to onset of African
      Burkitt lymphoma are unknown. We correlated age-specific patterns of 2,602 cases 
      of African Burkitt lymphoma (60% male, mean +/- SD age = 7.1 +/- 2.9 years) from 
      Uganda, Ghana, and Tanzania with malaria biomarkers published from these
      countries. Age-specific patterns of this disease and mean multiplicity of P.
      falciparum malaria parasites, defined as the average number of distinct genotypes
      per positive blood sample based on the merozoite surface protein-2 assessed by
      polymerase chain reaction, were correlated and both peaked between 5 and 9 years.
      This pattern, which was strong and consistent across regions, contrasted parasite
      prevalence, which peaked at 2 years and decreased slightly, and geometric mean
      parasite density, which peaked between 2 and 3 years and decreased sharply. Our
      findings suggest that concurrent infection with multiple malaria genotypes may be
      related to onset of African Burkitt lymphoma.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus
      artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in Zambian children.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in Zambia remains a public health and developmental
      challenge, affecting mostly children under five and pregnant women. In 2002, the 
      first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria was changed to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) that has proved to be highly efficacious against
      multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to 
      determine whether dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/PQP) had similar efficacy, 
      safety and tolerability as AL for the treatment of children with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria in Ndola, Zambia. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2006, 304 children
      (6-59 months old) with uncomplicated P. falciparum were enrolled, randomized to
      AL (101) or DHA/PQP (203) and followed up for 42 days. Outcome of treatment was
      defined according to the standard WHO classification, i.e. early treatment
      failure (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF, late parasitological failure (LPF) and
      adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Recurrent infections were 
      genotyped to distinguish between recrudescence and new infection. RESULTS: No ETF
      was observed. At day 28, PCR-uncorrected ACPR was 92% in the DHA/PQP and 74% in
      the AL arm (OR: 4.05; 95%CI: 1.89-8.74; p < 0.001). Most failure were new
      infections and PCR-corrected ACPR was similar in the two study arms (OR: 0.69;
      95%CI: 0.22-2.26; p = 0.33). Similar results were observed for day 42, i.e.
      higher PCR-uncorrected ACPR for DHA/PQP, mainly due to the difference observed up
      to day 28, while the PCR-corrected ACPR was similar: DHA/PQP: 93% (179/192), AL: 
      93% (84/90), (OR: 0.92; 95%CI: 0.30-2.64; p = 0.85). Except for cough, more
      frequent in the DHA/PQP arm (p = 0.04), there were no differences between
      treatment arms in the occurrence of adverse events. Two serious adverse events
      were probably associated to AL treatment. CONCLUSION: DHA/PQP was as efficacious,
      safe and well tolerated in treatment of uncomplicated malaria as AL, though in
      the latter group more new infections during the follow up were observed. DHA/PQP 
      seems a potential candidate to be used as an alternative first-line or rescue
      treatment in Zambia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN16263443, at

AB  - BACKGROUND: The accurate quantification of Plasmodium falciparum parasite numbers
      by PCR is an important tool for monitoring growth kinetics in subjects infected
      and subsequently treated with anti-malarial agents. METHODS: A real-time
      quantitative PCR (rt-qPCR) method using primers and a hydrolysis probe that
      targets the 18S rRNA gene was adapted and optimized to estimate parasite load in 
      blood samples. Samples included laboratory prepared blood samples of varying
      parasite concentrations (6.4 x 10(5) to 6.4 parasites per 500 mul of packed red
      blood cells (500pRBC)) and blood samples collected from an experimentally
      infected human subject collected at 19 time points over 10 days. Sample
      preparation and extraction, detection chemistry, assay reproducibility, and limit
      of detection were compared to a previously published SYBR Green rt-qPCR used in a
      malaria vaccine clinical trial. RESULTS: Both the rt-qPCR hydrolysis probe assay 
      and SYBR Green rt-qPCR provided a limit of detection of 6.4 x 10(1) parasites per
      500pRBC. However non-specific amplification in the SYBR Green rt-qPCR assay led
      to either inaccurate estimation of parasite load at levels below 6.4 x 10(2)
      parasites per 500pRBC and to false-positive detection of parasites in negative
      samples. The rt-qPCR hydrolysis probe assay was specific and provided reliable
      quantification of parasitaemia down to 6.4 x 10(1) parasites per 500pRBC.
      Notably, 12 of the 19 consecutive samples collected from the experimentally
      infected subject were at or below 6.4 x 10(2) copies per 500pRBC. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results show that the hydrolysis probe rt-qPCR assay is superior to the
      SYBR Green rt-qPCR for the quantification of P. falciparum in human blood
      samples. The hydrolysis probe rt-qPCR is now in use in the Queensland paediatric 
      infectious diseases laboratory (QPID) to monitor parasitaemia in
      experimentally-infected clinical trial subjects.

AB  - The emergence of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is a significant
      public health problem where malaria is endemic. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy
      of pyrosequencing to assess chloroquine resistance among P. falciparum isolates
      from the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia by analyzing the K76T and N86Y
      mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) and P. 
      falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1) genes, respectively. Blood samples (n 
      = 121) from microscopically positive P. falciparum cases were collected. DNA was 
      extracted, and fragments from each of the genes were amplified by PCR using new
      sets of primers. The amplicons were sequenced using a pyrosequencer. All of the
      121 samples were amplified for assessment of the PfCRT K76T and PfMDR1 N86Y
      mutations. All of the samples amplified for the PfCRT 76T mutation harbored the
      ACA codon (121/121; 100%), indicating the presence of the 76T mutation. For the
      PfMDR1 N86Y mutation, 72/121 samples (59.5%) had the sequence AAT at that
      position, indicating the presence of the wild-type allele (86N). However, 49/121 
      samples (40.5%) had a TAT codon, indicating the mutant allele (Y) at position 86.
      This study shows that pyrosequencing could be useful as a high throughput, rapid,
      and sensitive assay for the detection of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
      in drug-resistant P. falciparum strains. This will help health authorities in
      malaria-endemic regions to adopt new malaria control strategies that will be
      applicable for diagnostic and drug resistance assays for malaria and other
      life-threatening pathogens that are endemic in their respective countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Information on imported malaria caused by Plasmodium ovale parasite
      is scarce. METHODS: Sixteen cases were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Most
      cases had an incubation period ranging from 2 to 53 months and were African
      immigrants recently arrived or residents in Spain who had visited West Africa.
      Ten patients had underlying diseases and 5 suffered from a previous P. falciparum
      infection. Three patients had severe complications and 3 were asymptomatic. Rapid
      malaria test was positive in 2 out of 10 patients. Five were diagnosed only with 
      PCR. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale infection can be asymptomatic or cause severe
      complications up to 5 years after arriving.

AB  - Despite the ever-increasing output of Illumina sequencing data, loci with extreme
      base compositions are often under-represented or absent. To evaluate sources of
      base-composition bias, we traced genomic sequences ranging from 6% to 90% GC
      through the process by quantitative PCR. We identified PCR during library
      preparation as a principal source of bias and optimized the conditions. Our
      improved protocol significantly reduces amplification bias and minimizes the
      previously severe effects of PCR instrument and temperature ramp rate.

TI  - Azithromycin for treating uncomplicated malaria.
PG  - CD006688
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006688.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the development of drug resistance, the World Health
      Organization (WHO) recommends treating malaria with combination therapy.
      Azithromycin, an antibiotic with antimalarial properties, may be a useful
      additional option for antimalarial therapy. OBJECTIVES: To compare the use of
      azithromycin alone or in combination with other antimalarial drugs with the use
      of alternative antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria caused by
      Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the
      Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (August 2010); CENTRAL
      (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2010); MEDLINE (1966 to August 2010); EMBASE (1974
      to August 2010); LILACS (August 2010); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials
      (mRCT, August 2010); conference proceedings; and reference lists. We also
      contacted researchers and a pharmaceutical company. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin, either alone or combined
      with another antimalarial drug, with another antimalarial drug used alone or
      combined with another antimalarial drug, or with azithromycin combined with
      another antimalarial drug if different combinations or doses of azithromycin were
      used. The primary outcome was treatment failure by day 28, defined as
      parasitological or clinical evidence of treatment failure between the start of
      treatment and day 28. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure by day 28
      corrected for new infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fever 
      and parasite clearance time, and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Two people independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and
      assessed methodological quality. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria (2284
      participants, 69% males, 16% children). They were conducted in disparate malaria 
      endemic areas, with the earlier studies conducted in Thailand (five) and India
      (two), and the more recent studies (eight) spread across three continents (South 
      America, Africa, Asia). The 15 studies involved 41 treatment arms, 12 different
      drugs, and 28 different treatment regimens. Two studies examined P.
      vivax.Three-day azithromycin (AZ) monotherapy did not perform well for P. vivax
      or P. falciparum (Thailand: P. vivax failure rate 0.5 g daily, 56%, 95% CI 31 to 
      78. India: P. vivax failure rate 1 g daily,12%, 95% CI 7 to 21; P. falciparum
      failure rate 1 g daily, 64%, 95% CI 36 to 86.) A 1 g azithromycin and 0.6 g
      chloroquine combination daily for three days for uncomplicated P. falciparum
      infections was associated with increased treatment failure in India and Indonesia
      compared with the combination of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine
      (pooled RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.67), and compared with the combination
      atovaquone-proguanil in a multicentre trial in Columbia and Surinam (RR 24.72,
      95% CI 6.16 to 99.20). No increased risk of treatment failure was seen in two
      studies in Africa with mefloquine as the comparator drug (pooled RR 2.02, 95% CI 
      0.51 to 7.96, P = 0.3); the pooled RR for PCR-corrected data for the combination 
      versus mefloquine was 1.01, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.84 (P = 1.0). An increased treatment
      failure risk was seen when comparing azithromycin in a dose of 1.2 to 1.5 mg in
      combination with artesunate (200 mg per day for three days) with
      artemether-lumefantrine (pooled RR 3.08, 95% CI 2.09 to 4.55; PCR-corrected
      pooled RR 3.63, 95% CI 2.02 to 6.52).Serious adverse events and treatment
      discontinuation were similar across treatment arms. More adverse events were
      reported when comparing the 1 g azithromycin/ 0.6 g chloroquine combination with 
      mefloquine (pooled RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36) or atovaquone-proguanil (RR
      1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to1.83). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no evidence 
      for the superiority or equivalence of azithromycin monotherapy or combination
      therapy for the treatment of P. falciparum or P. vivax compared with other
      antimalarials or with the current first-line antimalarial combinations. The
      available evidence suggests that azithromycin is a weak antimalarial with some
      appealing safety characteristics. Unless the ongoing dose, formulation and
      product optimisation process results in a universally efficacious product, or a
      specific niche application is identified that is complementary to the current
      scala of more efficacious antimalarial combinations, azithromycin's future for
      the treatment of malaria does not look promising.

AB  - Evidences of reappearance of chloroquine sensitive Plasmodium falciparum
      haplotypes after cessation of chloroquine in many countries provide a rationale
      for the search of chloroquine sensitive haplotypes in P. falciparum isolates in
      Nepal where the use of chloroquine for falciparum malaria treatment has been
      ceased since 1988. P. falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter gene (pfcrt)
      haplotypes were determined and the factors associated with pfcrt haplotypes in
      the Eastern and Central regions of Nepal were identified. Blood samples from 106 
      microscopy-positive falciparum malaria patients (62 from the Eastern and 44 from 
      the Central region) were collected on filter paper. Pfcrt region covering codons 
      72-76 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. SVMNT haplotype was predominant in the 
      Central region, whereas CVIET haplotype significantly more common in the Eastern 
      region. In multivariable analysis of factors associated with CVIET haplotype, the
      Eastern region and parasite isolates from patients visiting India within one
      month are significant at 5% level of significance. These findings suggest that
      antimalarial pressure is different between Eastern and Central regions of Nepal
      and there is a need of an effective malaria control program in the border areas
      between India and Nepal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance (CQR) transporter
      protein (PfCRT) is known to be the important key of CQR. Recent studies have
      definitively demonstrated a link between mutations in the gene pfcrt and
      resistance to chloroquine in P. falciparum. Although these mutations are
      predictive of chloroquine resistance, they are not quantitatively predictive of
      the degree of resistance. METHODS: In this study, a total of 95 recently adapted 
      P. falciparum isolates from Thailand were included in the analysis. Parasites
      were characterized for their drug susceptibility phenotypes and genotypes with
      respect to pfcrt. From the original 95 isolates, 20 were selected for complete
      pfcrt sequence analysis. RESULTS: Almost all of the parasites characterized
      carried the previously reported mutations K76T, A220S, Q271E, N326S, I356T and
      R371I. On complete sequencing, isolates were identified with novel mutations at
      K76A and E198K. There was a suggestion that parasites carrying E198K were less
      resistant than those that did not. In addition, pfcrt and pfmdr1 gene expression 
      were investigated by real-time PCR. No relationship between the expression level 
      of either of these genes and response to drug was observed. CONCLUSION: Data from
      the present study suggest that other genes must contribute to the degree of
      resistance once the resistance phenotype is established through mutations in
      pfcrt.

AB  - Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum results in approximately 1 million annual
      deaths worldwide, with young children and pregnant mothers at highest risk.
      Disease severity might be related to parasite virulence factors, but expression
      profiling studies of parasites to test this hypothesis have been hindered by
      extensive sequence variation in putative virulence genes and a preponderance of
      host RNA in clinical samples. We report here the application of RNA sequencing to
      clinical isolates of P. falciparum, using not-so-random (NSR) primers to
      successfully exclude human ribosomal RNA and globin transcripts and enrich for
      parasite transcripts. Using NSR-seq, we confirmed earlier microarray studies
      showing upregulation of a distinct subset of genes in parasites infecting
      pregnant women, including that encoding the well-established pregnancy malaria
      vaccine candidate var2csa. We also describe a subset of parasite transcripts that
      distinguished parasites infecting children from those infecting pregnant women
      and confirmed this observation using quantitative real-time PCR and mass
      spectrometry proteomic analyses. Based on their putative functional properties,
      we propose that these proteins could have a role in childhood malaria
      pathogenesis. Our study provides proof of principle that NSR-seq represents an
      approach that can be used to study clinical isolates of parasites causing severe 
      malaria syndromes as well other blood-borne pathogens and blood-related diseases.

      estate in southern Mozambique.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-4-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dual problems of rising insecticide resistance in the malaria
      vectors and increasing human malaria cases since 2001 in southern Mozambique are 
      cause for serious concern. The selection of insecticides for use in indoor
      residual spraying (IRS) programmes is highly dependent on the extent to which
      local mosquitoes are susceptible to the approved classes of insecticides. The
      insecticide resistance status and role in malaria transmission of Anopheles
      funestus was evaluated at the Maragra Sugar Estate in southern Mozambique where
      an IRS vector control programme has been in operation for seven years using the
      carbamate insecticide bendiocarb. RESULTS: No Anopheles species were captured
      inside the sugar estate control area. Anopheles funestus group captured outside
      of the estate represented 90% (n = 475) of the total collections. Of the
      specimens identified to species by PCR (n = 167), 95% were An. funestus s.s. One 
      An. rivulorum was identified and seven specimens did not amplify. The Anopheles
      gambiae complex was less abundant (n = 53) and of those identified (n = 33) 76%
      were An. arabiensis and 24% An. merus. Insecticide susceptibility tests showed
      that wild-caught and F-1 family An. funestus were resistant to deltamethrin
      (32.5% mortality) and lambda-cyhalothrin (14.6% mortality), less so to bendiocarb
      (71.5% mortality) and fully susceptible to both malathion and DDT (100%).
      Bendiocarb and pyrethroid resistance was nullified using 4% piperonyl butoxide
      (Pbo), strongly suggesting that both are mediated by P450 monooxygenase
      detoxification. ELISA tests of An. funestus for Plasmodium falciparum, gave a
      sporozoite rate of 6.02% (n = 166). One unidentified member of the An. gambiae
      complex tested positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. CONCLUSION: Anopheles
      funestus was found to be the most abundant and principle vector of malaria in
      this area, with members of the An. gambiae complex being secondary vectors.
      Despite the continual use of bendiocarb within the estate for seven years and the
      level of An. funestus resistance to this insecticide, the IVC programme is still 
      effective against this and other Anopheles in that no vectors were found inside
      the control area. However, the Mozambique National Malaria Control Programme
      ceased the use of DDT and bendiocarb in this area of its operations in 2009, and 
      replaced these insecticides with a pyrethroid which will increase insecticide
      resistance selection pressure and impact on control programmes such as the
      Maragra IVC.

      Republic of the Congo, 2007.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0016420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data on malaria are scant in many high-burden countries
      including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which suffers the
      second-highest global burden of malaria. Malaria control efforts in regions with 
      challenging infrastructure require reproducible and efficient surveillance. We
      employed new high-throughput molecular testing to characterize the state of
      malaria control in the DRC and estimate childhood mortality attributable to
      excess malaria transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Demographic and Health
      Survey was a cross-sectional, population-based cluster household survey of adults
      aged 15-59 years in 2007 employing structured questionnaires and dried blood spot
      collection. Parasitemia was detected by real-time PCR, and survey responses
      measured adoption of malaria control measures and under-5 health indices. The
      response rate was 99% at the household level, and 8,886 households were surveyed 
      in 300 clusters; from 8,838 respondents molecular results were available. The
      overall prevalence of parasitemia was 33.5% (95% confidence interval [C.I.]
      32-34.9); P. falciparum was the most prevalent species, either as monoinfection
      (90.4%; 95% C.I. 88.8-92.1) or combined with P. malariae (4.9%; 95% C.I. 3.7-5.9)
      or P. ovale (0.6%; 95% C.I. 0.1-0.9). Only 7.7% (95% CI 6.8-8.6) of households
      with children under 5 owned an insecticide-treated bednet (ITN), and only 6.8%
      (95% CI 6.1-7.5) of under-fives slept under an ITN the preceding night. The
      overall under-5 mortality rate was 147 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% C.I.
      141-153) and between clusters was associated with increased P. falciparum
      prevalence; based on the population attributable fraction, 26,488 yearly under-5 
      deaths were attributable to excess malaria transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Adult P.
      falciparum prevalence is substantial in the DRC and is associated with under-5
      mortality. Molecular testing offers a new, generalizable, and efficient approach 
      to characterizing malaria endemicity in underserved countries.

TI  - Contribution of Anopheles funestus, An. gambiae and An. nili (Diptera: Culicidae)
      to the perennial malaria transmission in the southern and western forest areas of
      Cote d'Ivoire.

AB  - The involvement of members of the Anopheles gambiae complex Giles and An.
      funestus Giles and An. nili Theobald groups in the transmission of Plasmodium
      falciparum was recently investigated in the villages of Gbatta and Kpehiri, which
      lie, respectively, in forest areas in the west and south of Cote d'Ivoire. Adult 
      female mosquitoes were collected, using human landing catches, inside and outside
      dwellings. After identification and dissection, the heads and thoraces of all the
      anopheline mosquitoes were tested, in an ELISA, for circumsporozoite protein
      (CSP). All the female anopheline mosquitoes collected and identified to species
      using PCR were found to be An. gambiae s.s., An. nili s.s. or An. funestus s.s., 
      with An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus s.s. predominant in Gbatta but An. nili
      s.s. the most common species in Kpehiri. In Gbatta, 3.1% of the female An.
      gambiae collected, 5.0% of the female An. funestus and 1.8% of the female An.
      nili were found CSP-positive. The corresponding values in Kpehiri were even
      higher, at 5.9%, 6.2% and 2.4%, respectively. The estimated entomological
      inoculation rates (EIR) were very high: 302 infected bites (139 from An. gambiae,
      146 from An. funestus and 17 from An. nili)/person-year in Gbatta and 484
      infected bites (204 from An. gambiae, 70 from An. funestus and 210 from An.
      nili)/person-year in Kpehiri. In Gbatta, An. gambiae s.s. was responsible for
      most of the rainy-season transmission while An. funestus became the main malaria 
      vector in the dry seasons. In Kpehiri, however, An. nili appeared to be the main 
      vector throughout the year, with An. gambiae of secondary importance and An.
      funestus only becoming a significant vector during the rainy season. Although, in
      both study sites, intense transmission was therefore occurring and the same three
      species of anopheline mosquito were present, the relative importance of each
      mosquito species in the epidemiology of the human malaria at each site differed
      markedly.

      protein 1, from worldwide isolates.
PG  - 292-7
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0432 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium vivax msp1p, a paralog of the candidate vaccine antigen P. vivax
      merozoite surface protein 1, possesses a signal peptide at its N-terminus and two
      epidermal growth factor-like domains at its C-terminus with a
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment site. The msp1p gene locus may have
      originated by a duplication of the msp1 gene locus in a common ancestor of the
      analyzed Plasmodium species and lost from P. yoelii, P. berghei, and P.
      falciparum during their evolutionary history. Full-length sequences of the msp1p 
      gene were generally highly conserved; they had a few amino acid substitutions,
      one highly polymorphic E/Q-rich region, and a single-to-triple hepta-peptide
      repeat motif. Twenty-one distinguishable allelic types (A1-A21) of the E/Q-rich
      region were identified from worldwide isolates. Among them, four types were
      detected in isolates from South Korea. The length polymorphism of the E/Q-rich
      region might be useful as a genetic marker for population structure studies in
      malaria-endemic areas.

AB  - The malaria vaccine candidate antigens erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175),
      merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP-3), and apical membrane antigen (AMA-1) from
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates from countries in central and west Africa were
      assessed for allelic diversity. Samples were collected on filter paper from 600
      P. falciparum-infected symptomatic patients in Cameroon, Republic of Congo,
      Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Senegal and screened for class-specific amplification
      fragments. Genetic diversity, assessed by mean heterozygosity, was comparable
      among countries. We detected a clinical increase in eba 175 F-allele frequency
      from west to east across the study region. No statistical difference in msp-3
      allele distribution between countries was observed. The ama-1 3D7 alleles were
      present at a lower frequency in central Africa than in West Africa. We also
      detected little to no genetic differentiation among sampling locations. This
      finding indicates that, at least at the level of resolution offered by
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, these antigens showed
      remarkable genetic homogeneity throughout the region sampled, perhaps caused by
      balancing selection to maintain a diverse array of antigen haplotyes.

TI  - Evaluation of prevalence's of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations in Angola.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Angola. The 
      most vulnerable groups to Plasmodium falciparum infection are pregnant women and 
      children under five years of age. The use of an intermittent preventive treatment
      (IPT) with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) in pregnant women was introduced in
      Angola in 2006 by the National Malaria Control Programme, and currently this
      strategy has been considered to be used for children malaria control. Considering
      the previous wide use of SP combination in Angola, together to the reported cases
      of SP treatment failure it is crucial the evaluation of the prevalence of five
      mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes associated to P. falciparum resistance to SP
      before the introduction of S/P IPT in children. METHODS: The study was conducted 
      in five provinces, with different transmission intensities: Huambo, Cabinda,
      Uige, Kwanza Norte, and Malanje. The detection of the mutations in pfdhfr and
      pfdhps genes was carried out in 452 P. falciparum blood samples by PCR RFLP.
      RESULTS: For pfdhfr gene, 90,3% of the samples carried the mutation 51I, with
      7.5% of mixed infections; 51% carried wild type allele 59C, with 29.2% mixed
      infections and; 99.1% of isolates harboured the mutant allele 108N. Concerning,
      pfdhps gene, 83,1% were mutant type 437G with 11% mixed infections , while 87% of
      the studied isolates were wild type for codon 540. DISCUSSION: This is the first 
      representative epidemiological study of the whole Angola country on the
      prevalence of the genotypes associated with SP chemoresistance. A high frequency 
      of individual mutations in both genes (51I and 108N in pfdhfr, and 437G in
      pfdhps) was found, besides a low prevalence of the quintuple mutation.
      CONCLUSION: The data showed that the implementation IPT using SP in children
      needs to be reviewed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scarce data are available on Plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial drug
      resistance in Pakistan. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the
      prevalence of P. falciparum resistance associated polymorphisms in field isolates
      from southern Pakistan. METHODS: Blood samples from 244 patients with blood-slide
      confirmed P. falciparum mono-infections were collected between 2005-2007. Single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter 
      (pfcrt K76T), multi drug resistance (pfmdr1 N86Y), dihydrofolate reductase
      (pfdhfr A16V, N51I, C59R, S108N, I164L) and dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps
      A436S, G437A and E540K) genes and pfmdr1 gene copy numbers were determined using 
      PCR based methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1 86Y was 93%
      and 57%, respectively. The prevalence of pfdhfr double mutations 59R + 108N/51R +
      108N was 92%. The pfdhfr triple mutation (51I, 59R, 108N) occurred in 3% of
      samples. The pfdhfr (51I, 59R, 108N) and pfdhps (437G, 540E) quintuple mutation
      was found in one isolate. Pfdhps 437G was observed in 51% and 540E in 1% of the
      isolates. One isolate had two pfmdr1 copies and carried the pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 
      76T alleles. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate high prevalence of in vivo
      resistance to chloroquine, whereas high grade resistance to
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine does not appear to be widespread among P. falciparum
      in southern Pakistan.

TI  - var gene transcription and PfEMP1 expression in the rosetting and cytoadhesive
      Plasmodium falciparum clone FCR3S1.2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenicity of Plasmodium falciparum is in part due to the
      ability of the parasitized red blood cell (pRBC) to adhere to intra-vascular host
      cell receptors and serum-proteins. Binding of the pRBC is mediated by Plasmodium 
      falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a large multi-variant
      molecule encoded by a family of approximately 60 var genes. METHODS: The study of
      var gene transcription in the parasite clone FCR3S1.2 was performed by
      semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The expression of the major
      PfEMP1 in FCR3S1.2 pRBC was analysed with polyclonal sera in rosette disruption
      assays and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Transcripts from var1 (FCR3S1.2(var1);
      IT4var21) and other var genes were detected by semi-quantitative PCR but results 
      from qPCR showed that one var gene transcript dominated over the others
      (FCR3S1.2(var2); IT4var60). Antibodies raised in rats to the recombinant
      NTS-DBL1alpha of var2 produced in E. coli completely and dose-dependently
      disrupted rosettes ( approximately 95% at a dilution of 1/5). The sera reacted
      with the Maurer's clefts in trophozoite stages (IFA) and to the infected
      erythrocyte surface (FACS) indicating that FCR3S1.2(var2) encodes the dominant
      PfEMP1 expressed in this parasite. CONCLUSION: The major transcript in the
      rosetting model parasite FCR3S1.2 is FCR3S1.2(var2) (IT4var60). The results
      suggest that this gene encodes the PfEMP1-species responsible for the rosetting
      phenotype of this parasite. The activity of previously raised antibodies to the
      NTS-DBL1alpha of FCR3S1.2(var1) is likely due to cross-reactivity with
      NTS-DBL1alpha of the var2 encoded PfEMP1.

TI  - Increased prevalence of the Plasmodium falciparum Pfmdr1 86N genotype among field
      isolates from Franceville, Gabon after replacement of chloroquine by
      artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine.
PG  - 512-7

AB  - Despite global antimalarial measures, Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a
      major public health problem. WHO has recommended the use of arteminisin-based
      combination therapy to limit the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance.
      However, ACT treatment failures have been linked to the selection of the wild
      types 86N genotype of P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) and the 76K
      genotype of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance (Pfcrt) genes. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the molecular impact of widespread implementation of
      artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine on local parasite population in
      Franceville, Gabon. We analyzed 230 pediatric field isolates (96 from 2004 and
      134 from 2009). Routine hematological parameters were collected. Pfmdr1 codons 86
      and 1246 and Pfcrt codon 76 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP and the prevalence of
      the genotypes was compared. The children's mean age did not differ between 2004
      and 2009 (respectively 31.8 (6-84) months vs 38.6 (6-84) months, p=0.32), and
      neither did mean parasitemia [16,750 (1000-96,234) and 14,587 (1093-83,941)
      parasites/muL, respectively (p=0.21)]. The mean hemoglobin level was higher in
      2009 than in 2004 (11.0 +/- 2.4 vs 7.8 +/- 2.0 g/dL, respectively; p=0.04). More 
      interesting, the prevalence of Pfmdr1 wild type 86N increased from 15.6%
      (n=15/96) in 2004 to 31.3% (n=42/134) in 2009 (p=0.007). A significant increase
      combining pure and mixed genotypes (86N+86N/Y) was also found between 2004 and
      2009 (p=0.02), while the prevalence of genotypes Pfmdr1 1246D, Pfcrt wild type
      76T and all mixed genotypes (Pfmdr1 86N/Y and 1246D/Y, and 76K/T) remained
      stable. The complexity of isolates was high (around 2.9 and 2.4) and the FC27
      allele of Pfmsp2 was more prevalent. These findings show a substantial benefice
      of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine and of new control measures.
      The selection, in the general population, of wild type Pfmdr1 86N, which is
      associated with antiplasmodial resistance against some drugs, has been induced
      underlining the need for molecular surveillance of the impact of ACT on
      antimalarial resistance.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus infection may lead to slower emergence of P. falciparum in
      blood.
PG  - e16034
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0016034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Areas endemic for Plasmodium falciparum, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) overlap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. HBV and HCV 
      infections develop in the liver, where takes place the first development stage of
      P. falciparum before its further spread in blood. The complex mechanisms involved
      in the development of hepatitis may potentially influence the development of the 
      liver stage of malaria parasites. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these
      interactions could provide new pathophysiological insights for treatment
      strategies in Malaria. METHODOLOGY: We studied a cohort of 319 individuals living
      in a village where the three infections are prevalent. The patients were
      initially given a curative antimalarial treatment and were then monitored for the
      emergence of asexual P. falciparum forms in blood, fortnightly for one year, by
      microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At inclusion, 65
      (20.4%) subjects had detectable malaria parasites in blood, 36 (11.3%) were HBV
      chronic carriers, and 61 (18.9%) were HCV chronic carriers. During follow-up,
      asexual P. falciparum forms were detected in the blood of 203 patients. The
      median time to P. falciparum emergence in blood was respectively 140 and 120 days
      in HBV- and HBV+ individuals, and 135 and 224 days in HCV- and HCV+ individuals. 
      HCV carriage was associated with delayed emergence of asexual P. falciparum forms
      in blood relative to patients without HCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot
      study represents first tentative evidence of a potential epidemiological
      interaction between HBV, HCV and P. falciparum infections. Age is an important
      confounding factor in this setting however multivariate analysis points to an
      interaction between P. falciparum and HCV at the hepatic level with a slower
      emergence of P. falciparum in HCV chronic carriers. More in depth analysis are
      necessary to unravel the basis of hepatic interactions between these two
      pathogens, which could help in identifying new therapeutic approaches against
      malaria.

TI  - Feasibility of flow cytometry for measurements of Plasmodium falciparum parasite 
      burden in studies in areas of malaria endemicity by use of bidimensional
      assessment of YOYO-1 and autofluorescence.
PG  - 968-74
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01961-10 [doi]
AB  - The detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum in studies of malaria
      endemicity primarily relies upon microscopy. High-throughput quantitative methods
      with less subjectivity and greater reliability are needed for investigational
      studies. The staining of parasitized erythrocytes with YOYO-1 for flow cytometry 
      bears great potential as a tool for assessing malaria parasite burden. Capillary 
      blood was collected from children presenting to the pediatric ward of the Manhica
      District Hospital in Mozambique for parasitemia assessment by thick and thin
      blood films, flow cytometry (YOYO-1(530/585)), and quantitative real-time PCR
      (qRT-PCR). Whole blood was fixed and stained with YOYO-1 for acquisition on a
      cytometer to assess the frequency of infected erythrocyte events. qRT-PCR was
      used as the gold standard for the detection of P. falciparum. The YOYO-1(530/585)
      method was as sensitive and specific as conventional microscopy (area under the
      receiver operating characteristic, 0.9 for both methods). The interrater mean
      difference for YOYO-1(530/585) was near zero. Parasite density using flow
      cytometry and complete blood counts returned density estimates with a mean
      difference 2.2 times greater than results by microscopy (confidence interval,
      1.46 to 3.60) but with limits of agreement between 10 times lower and 50 times
      higher than those of microscopy. The YOYO-1(530/585) staining pattern was
      established exactly as demonstrated in animal models, but the assay was limited
      by the lack of appropriate negative-control samples for establishing background
      levels and the definition of positives in areas in which malaria is endemic.
      YOYO-1(530/585) is a high-throughput tool with great potential if the limitations
      of negative controls and heterogeneous levels of background signal can be
      overcome.

TI  - Evaluation of the rapid diagnostic test SDFK40 (Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH) for the
      diagnosis of malaria in a non-endemic setting.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated the SD Bioline Malaria Ag 05FK40
      (SDFK40), a three-band RDT detecting Plasmodium falciparum-specific parasite
      lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH) and pan Plasmodium-specific pLDH (pan-pLDH), in a
      reference setting. METHODS: The SDFK40 was retrospectively and prospectively
      tested against a panel of stored (n = 341) and fresh (n = 181) whole blood
      samples obtained in international travelers suspected of malaria, representing
      the four Plasmodium species as well as Plasmodium negative samples, and compared 
      to microscopy and PCR results. The prospective panel was run together with
      OptiMAL (Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH) and SDFK60 (histidine-rich protein-2
      (HRP-2)/pan-pLDH). RESULTS: Overall sensitivities for P. falciparum tested
      retrospectively and prospectively were 67.9% and 78.8%, reaching 100% and 94.6%
      at parasite densities >1,000/mul. Sensitivity at parasite densities </= 100/mul
      was 9.1%. Overall sensitivities for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale were
      86.7% and 80.0% (retrospectively) and 92.9% and 76.9% (prospectively), reaching
      94.7% for both species (retrospective panel) at parasite densities >500/mul.
      Sensitivity for Plasmodium malariae was 21.4%. Species mismatch occurred in 0.7% 
      of samples (3/411) and was limited to non-falciparum species erroneously
      identified as P. falciparum. None of the Plasmodium negative samples in the
      retrospective panel reacted positive. Compared to OptiMAL and SDFK60, SDFK40
      showed lower sensitivities for P. falciparum, but better detection of P. ovale.
      Inter-observer agreement and test reproducibility were excellent, but lot-to-lot 
      variability was observed for pan-pLDH results in case of P. falciparum.
      CONCLUSION: SDFK40 performance was poor at low (</= 100/mul) parasite densities, 
      precluding its use as the only diagnostic tool for malaria diagnosis. SDFK40
      performed excellent for P. falciparum samples at high (>1,000/mul) parasite
      densities as well as for detection of P. vivax and P. ovale at parasite densities
      >500/mul.

TI  - Detection of malaria infection in blood transfusion: a comparative study among
      real-time PCR, rapid diagnostic test and microscopy: sensitivity of Malaria
      detection methods in blood transfusion.

AB  - The transmission of malaria by blood transfusion was one of the first
      transfusion-transmitted infections recorded in the world. Transfusion-transmitted
      malaria may lead to serious problems because infection with Plasmodium falciparum
      may cause rapidly fatal death. This study aimed to compare real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (real-time PCR) with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and light
      microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium spp. in blood transfusion, both in
      endemic and non-endemic areas of malaria disease in Iran. Two sets of 50 blood
      samples were randomly collected. One set was taken from blood samples donated in 
      blood bank of Bandar Abbas, a city located in a malarious-endemic area, and the
      other set from Tehran, a non-endemic one. Light microscopic examination on both
      thin and thick smears, RDTs, and real-time PCR were performed on the blood
      samples and the results were compared. Thin and thick light microscopic
      examinations of all samples as well as RDT results were negative for Plasmodium
      spp. Two blood samples from endemic area were positive only with real-time PCR.
      It seems that real-time PCR as a highly sensitive method can be helpful for the
      confirmation of malaria infection in different units of blood transfusion
      organization especially in malaria-endemic areas where the majority of donors may
      be potentially infected with malaria parasites.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that Artesunate-mefloquine paediatric (AS+MEF)
      is as effective as Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in treating acute uncomplicated
      malaria in children. METHODS: In an open label, randomized controlled clinical
      trial, children aged 6-59 months were randomized to receive AS+MEF or AL. Both
      drug regimens were given for 3 days, and follow-up was for 28 days. The primary
      endpoint was the 28-day cure rate and was defined as proportion of patients with 
      PCR-corrected cure rate after 28 days of follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred and
      fifty-six patients with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were
      randomly assigned to receive AS+MEF (n = 77) or AL (n = 79). PCR-corrected day 28
      cure rates for per protocol (PP) populations were 99% for AS+MEF and 97% (P = 1) 
      for AL. For the intention to treat (ITT) population, cure rates were 96% for
      AS+MEF and 92% (P = 0.49) for AL. Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: 
      AS+MEF is as effective as AL, and both combinations were efficacious and safe.

AB  - Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have become valuable tools for the
      diagnosis of malaria in both endemic and non-endemic areas. During a 7-year
      period, first the MalaQuick rapid test and then the NOW Malaria test, were
      evaluated by well-trained laboratory technicians in a university hospital
      laboratory of parasitology. A total of 635 blood samples were selected from 4731 
      blood specimens obtained from travellers at the emergency department, at wards
      and at out-patient clinics. The samples were analysed by microscopy and RDT.
      Malaria parasites were detected in the blood films of 134 (21%) samples. The
      sensitivity of the RDT for Plasmodium falciparum was 97.7% (84 of 86 samples)
      with a negative predictive value of 99.6%. The two false-negative results were
      associated with low levels of parasitaemia. For non-falciparum species the
      sensitivity was only 58.3% (28 of 48 samples). Based on the excellent ability of 
      the RDTs to detect P. falciparum infections, we recommend the use of the NOW
      Malaria test as a complement to microscopy in the laboratory.

TI  - Prevalence of molecular markers of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during the intermittent preventive treatment in infants
      coupled with the expanded program immunization in Senegal.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-2236-9 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown the efficacy of the intermittent preventive treatment 
      (IPT) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) coupled with the expanded program of
      immunization (EPI) in infants. However, its adoption as a strategy is conditioned
      by the long-term efficacy of SP. The impact of IPT-SP coupled with the EPI on the
      prevalence of markers of resistance to SP was evaluated during this study
      conducted in Southern Senegal. Three cross-sectional surveys in two health
      districts (IPT+) were conducted prior to the implementation, 1 year, and 2 years 
      after. A third district located between the two districts served as a test zone
      (IPT-). PCR tests were carried out from filter papers collected in children under
      five for the two first measures and from positive rapid diagnostic tests in the
      same population for the third measure. Mutations in codons 51, 59, and 108 of the
      DHFR gene and in codons 437 and 540 of the DHPS were analyzed. The results showed
      that the prevalence of DHFR triple mutation was more frequent after 2 years in
      IPT+ areas. Regarding quadruple mutation, DHFR (51, 59, and 108) and DHPS (437), 
      no difference was noted between the two areas. The quintuple mutation was not
      observed after 2 years of implementation in both areas. However, an individual
      analysis showed significant differences in the individual mutation points 51, 59,
      108, and 437. This study reveals that despite an increase in the prevalence of
      individual mutations, the IPT-SP coupled with the EPI has no major impact on DHFR
      and DHPS combined mutations.

TI  - Transmission intensity and malaria vector population structure in Magugu, Babati 
      District in northern Tanzania.
PG  - 54-61
AB  - A 1-year longitudinal study was conducted in Magugu in Babati district, northern 
      Tanzania to determine malaria vector population structure and malaria
      transmission indices. Mosquitoes were sampled using the Centre for Disease
      Control (CDC) light traps. A total of 110,357 adult female mosquitoes were
      collected. Anopheles gambiae s.1. accounted 25% of the total female mosquito
      collected. Relatively fewer An. funestus were collected. Other mosquito species
      collected were An. pharoensis, An. coustani, An. maculipalpis, An. marshallii,
      Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx unnivittatus, Mansonia uniformis and Ma. africana. An 
      analysis by Polymerase Chain Reaction revealed that An. arabiensis was the only
      member of the An. gambiae complex in the collected samples. The number of
      mosquito collected correlated with the increasing mean rainfall. Blood meal
      analysis showed a higher human enzymatic reaction among An. gambiae s.1. (63.5%) 
      followed by An. funestus (42.9%). Bovine enzymatic reaction was higher among An. 
      coustani (73.7%) followed by the An. pharoensis (66.7%). The Enzyme Linked
      Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum
      circumsporozoites proteins in 10,000 female Anopheles mosquitoes. Only two An.
      arabiensis were found to be infected. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR)
      was estimated at 0.51 infectious bites per person per year. This EIR was
      considered to be relatively low, indicating that malaria transmission in this
      area is low. Variability in mosquito blood meal shows availability of variety of 
      preferred blood meal choices and impact of other factors inhibiting
      mosquito-human host contact. The study has provided information considered useful
      in the mapping of the vector distribution and population structure in the
      country. Such information is considered to be among the essential tools for
      planning malaria control interventions.

TI  - Detecting adenosine triphosphatase 6 (pfATP6) point mutations that may be
      associated with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin: prevalence at
      baseline, before policy change in Uganda.
PG  - 40-7
AB  - The artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) of artemether and lumefantrine
      (Co-artem) has recently replaced chloroquine and fansidar as the first line
      treatment policy drug in Uganda. It is necessary to develop practical procedures 
      to monitor the likely emergence and spread of artemisinin resistant P. falciparum
      strains. We have analyzed the genotypes of PfATP6 in parasites from 300 stored
      filter paper samples from malaria patients who were diagnosed and treated in the 
      years 1999 to 2004 at three field sites in Uganda. This is a period just prior to
      introduction of Co-artem. In order to develop a simple molecular procedure for
      mutation detection, regions of PfATP6 encoding protein domains important in
      artemisinin binding was amplified by nested PCR. Three DNA products, which
      together contain most of the coding region of amino acids located within the
      putative active site of pfATP6 were readily amplified. The amplified DNA was
      digested by restriction enzymes and the fragments sized by agarose gel
      electrophoresis. For the important codons 260, 263 and 769, methods using
      engineered restriction sites were employed. We did not find mutations at codons
      for the key residues Lys 260, Leu263, Gln266, Ser769 and Asn1039. Nucleotide
      sequencing of pfATPase6 gene DNA from at least 15 clinical isolates confirmed the
      above findings and suggested that mutations at these amino acid residues have not
      emerged in our study sites.

TI  - Sensitivity of microscopy compared to molecular diagnosis of p. Falciparum:
      implications on malaria treatment in epidemic areas in kenya.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Detection of Plasmodium species by microscopy has been the gold standard for
      diagnosis of malaria for more than a century. Despite the fact that there is a
      significant decline in the number of positive cases reported from microscopy,
      antimalarial drugs prescriptions are on continuous increase as patients present
      with symptoms of malaria. This makes it difficult to establish accuracy,
      sensitivity and specificity of light microscopy in diagnosis of malaria in
      epidemic areas. This study was designed to compare microscopy with polymerase
      chain reaction as diagnostic methods for malaria in three epidemic areas in
      Kenya. A total of 356 patients presenting with malaria symptoms were diagnosed by
      microscopy and dried blood filter paper spots were collected from patient in
      Kisii, West Pokot and Narok districts. Plasmodium falciparum DNA was extracted
      from the dried blood filter samples. Primers specific for the Plasmodium Species 
      were designed and used in a two step amplification of the Pfmdr gene. The PCR
      products were analyzed in ethidium bromide stained 1.5% agarose gel. It was found
      that 72 out of 350 specimens diagnosed as negative were positive for P.
      falciparum by nested PCR, while 6 which were microscopy positive were confirmed
      so by nested PCR. This study demonstrates that there is a high level of
      misdiagnosis which may either lead to denial for deserved treatment or undeserved
      treatment. Nested PCR detection of malaria parasites is a very useful complement 
      to microscopy although it is expensive and takes long time. Additionally, smear
      negative patients suspected to have malaria should be subjected to PCR diagnosis 
      to improve rational drug use. The economic burden of misdiagnosis and
      mistreatment of malaria outweighs that of PCR diagnosis, hence this diagnostic
      mode could be tenable in the long run even in rural areas.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1017996108 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum has exerted tremendous selective pressure on genes that
      improve survival in severe malarial infections. Systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is six to eight times more prevalent in women
      of African descent than in women of European descent. Here we provide evidence
      that a genetic susceptibility to SLE protects against cerebral malaria. Mice that
      are prone to SLE because of a deficiency in FcgammaRIIB or overexpression of
      Toll-like receptor 7 are protected from death caused by cerebral malaria.
      Protection appears to be by immune mechanisms that allow SLE-prone mice better to
      control their overall inflammatory responses to parasite infections. These
      findings suggest that the high prevalence of SLE in women of African descent
      living outside of Africa may result from the inheritance of genes that are
      beneficial in the immune control of cerebral malaria but that, in the absence of 
      malaria, contribute to autoimmune disease.

      real-time polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 597-601
LID - 10.1007/s10096-010-1126-5 [doi]
AB  - Recently, Plasmodium knowlesi has been recognised as the fifth Plasmodium species
      causing malaria in humans. Hundreds of human cases infected with this originally 
      simian Plasmodium species have been described in Asian countries and increasing
      numbers are reported in Europe from travellers. The growing impact of tourism and
      economic development in South and Southeast Asia are expected to subsequently
      lead to a further increase in cases both among locals and among travellers. P.
      knowlesi is easily misidentified in microscopy as P. malariae or P. falciparum.
      We developed new primers for the rapid and specific detection of this species by 
      low-cost real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and added this method to an
      already existing panel of primers used for the molecular identification of the
      other four species in one reaction. Reference laboratories should now be able to 
      identify undisputably and rapidly P. knowlesi, as it is a potentially fatal
      pathogen.

TI  - Malaria transmission in two rural communities in the forest zone of Ghana.
PG  - 1465-71
LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-2195-1 [doi]
AB  - Malaria transmission was assessed in two rural communities, Kona and Afamanaso in
      Sekyere South district, Ashanti Region, in the forest zone of Ghana to provide
      baseline data for ongoing clinical studies and the evaluation of the effect of
      interventions. Altogether, 3,479 Anopheles gambiae and 1,157 Anopheles funestus
      were caught by human landing catches. Sporozoite rates determined by either
      microscopy of salivary glands or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for
      Plasmodium falciparum in the two villages were 6.6% vs. 8.9% for the main vector 
      A. gambiae and 3.2% vs. 6.3% for A. funestus. ELISA tests of dissected specimens 
      compared to microscopy of salivary glands were 1.3 and 2.0 times more positive
      for A. gambiae and A. funestus, respectively. Plasmodium infections of 122
      microscopically positive salivary glands of A. gambiae were identified by
      real-time PCR as 95 (77.9%) P. falciparum, 7 (5.7%) Plasmodium malariae, 7 (5.7%)
      Plasmodium ovale and 1 (0.8%) mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. malariae.
      Transmission in the area was found to be intense and perennial with some seasonal
      variations during the study period from Dec. 2003 to Aug. 2005. Although the two 
      villages were only 10 km apart from each other, Annual Biting Rates (ABRs) and
      Annual Entomological Inoculation Rates (AEIRs) were much higher at Afamanaso
      (11,643 vs. 866) than at Kona (5,329 vs. 490). Most of the transmission (91.4%)
      occurred during bedtime hours from 21 to 6 h. It is important to note that there 
      was still a substantial transmission before 21 h with AEIRs of 57.3 at Afamanso
      and 38.7 at Kona. The distribution of impregnated bednets alone, therefore, may
      not be sufficiently effective.

LID - 10.2119/molmed.2010.00155 [doi]
AB  - Total cellular RNA level is stable usually, although it may increase gradually
      during growth or decrease gradually under certain stressors. However, we found
      that mammal cell RNAs could be doubled within 24 h in response to free heme
      accumulation (ischemia reperfusion and malaria infection) or a high level of
      glucose treatment (diabetes). Clinical investigations in rats showed that
      pretreatment with heme (24 h for doubling total RNAs) alleviated oxidative
      damages caused by diabetes, and pretreatment with glucose (24 h for trebling
      total RNAs) alleviated oxidative damages caused by ischemia reperfusion or
      malaria infection. Therefore, this rapid RNA amplification may play an important 
      role in mammal adaptation to diabetes, ischemia reperfusion and malaria
      infection-derived oxidative stress. This rapid RNA amplification is derived from 
      glucose and heme, but not from their accompanying reactive oxygen species.
      Hexokinases endure glucose-derived reactive oxygen species accumulation but are
      not related glucose-derived RNA amplification. In contrast, the TATA box-binding 
      protein (TBP) mediates all glucose- and heme-induced RNA amplification in mammal 
      cells.

TI  - Molecular correlates of experimental cerebral malaria detectable in whole blood.
PG  - 1244-53
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00964-10 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is a primary cause of deaths caused by Plasmodium
      falciparum in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Laboratory tests based on
      early detection of host biomarkers in patient blood would help in the prognosis
      and differential diagnosis of CM. Using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA murine model 
      of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), we have identified over 300 putative
      diagnostic biomarkers of ECM in the circulation by comparing the whole-blood
      transcriptional profiles of resistant mice (BALB/c) to those of two susceptible
      strains (C57BL/6 and CBA/CaJ). Our results suggest that the transcriptional
      profile of whole blood captures the molecular and immunological events associated
      with the pathogenesis of disease. We find that during ECM, erythropoiesis is
      dysfunctional, thrombocytopenia is evident, and glycosylation of cell surface
      components may be modified. Furthermore, analysis of immunity-related genes
      suggests that slightly distinct mechanisms of immunopathogenesis may operate in
      susceptible C57BL/6 and CBA/CaJ mice. Furthermore, our data set has allowed us to
      create a molecular signature of ECM composed of a subset of circulatory markers. 
      Complement component C1q, beta-chain, nonspecific cytotoxic cell receptor protein
      1, prostate stem cell antigen, DnaJC, member 15, glutathione S-transferase
      omega-1, and thymidine kinase 1 were overexpressed in blood during the
      symptomatic phase of ECM, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
      These studies provide the first host transcriptome database that is uniquely
      altered during the pathogenesis of ECM in blood. A subset of these mediators of
      ECM warrant validation in P. falciparum-infected young African children as
      diagnostic markers of CM.

TI  - Reticulocyte and erythrocyte binding-like proteins function cooperatively in
      invasion of human erythrocytes by malaria parasites.
PG  - 1107-17
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01021-10 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria in humans and
      invades erythrocytes using multiple ligand-receptor interactions. Two important
      protein families involved in erythrocyte binding are the erythrocyte binding-like
      (EBL) and the reticulocyte binding-like (RBL or P. falciparum Rh [PfRh])
      proteins. We constructed P. falciparum lines lacking expression of EBL proteins
      by creating single and double knockouts of the corresponding genes for eba-175,
      eba-181, and eba-140 and show that the EBL and PfRh proteins function
      cooperatively, consistent with them playing a similar role in merozoite invasion.
      We provide evidence that PfRh and EBL proteins functionally interact, as loss of 
      function of EBA-181 ablates the ability of PfRh2a/b protein antibodies to inhibit
      merozoite invasion. Additionally, loss of function of some ebl genes results in
      selection for increased transcription of the PfRh family. This provides a
      rational basis for considering PfRh and EBL proteins for use as a combination
      vaccine against P. falciparum. We immunized rabbits with combinations of PfRh and
      EBL proteins to test the ability of antibodies to block merozoite invasion in
      growth inhibition assays. A combination of EBA-175, PfRh2a/b, and PfRh4
      recombinant proteins induced antibodies that potently blocked merozoite invasion.
      This validates the use of a combination of these ligands as a potential vaccine
      that would have broad activity against P. falciparum.

TI  - Similar efficacy and tolerability of double-dose chloroquine and
      artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in
      Guinea-Bissau: a randomized trial.
PG  - 109-16
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiq001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2008, Guinea-Bissau introduced artemether-lumefantrine for
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Previously, 3 times the standard dose of
      chloroquine, that was probably efficacious against Plasmodium falciparum with the
      resistance-associated chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) 76T allele, was 
      routinely used. The present study compared the efficacy and tolerability of a
      double standard dose of chloroquine with the efficacy and tolerability of
      artemether-lumefantrine. METHODS: In a randomized open-label clinical trial,
      artemether-lumefantrine or chloroquine (50 mg/kg) were given as 6 divided doses
      over 3 days to children aged 6 months--15 years who had uncomplicated P.
      falciparum monoinfection. Drug concentrations were measured on day 7. P.
      falciparum multidrug resistance gene N86Y and pfcrt K76T alleles were identified.
      RESULTS: The polymerase chain reaction-adjusted day 28 and 42 treatment
      efficacies were 162 (97%) of 168 and 155 (97%) of 161, respectively, for
      artemether-lumefantrine and 150 (95%) of 158 and 138 (94%) of 148, respectively, 
      for chloroquine. When parasites with resistance-associated pfcrt 76T were
      treated, the day 28 efficacy of chloroquine was 87%. No severe drug-related
      adverse events were detected. Symptom resolution was similar with both
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments achieved the World Health
      Organization-recommended efficacy for antimalarials that will be adopted as
      policy. High-dose chloroquine treatment regimes should be further evaluated with 
      the aim of assessing chloroquine as a potential partner drug to artemisinin
      derivatives. Clinical trials registration. NCT00426439.

TI  - High-throughput molecular diagnosis of circumsporozoite variants VK210 and VK247 
      detects complex Plasmodium vivax infections in malaria endemic populations in
      Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 391-8
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2010.11.010 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is endemic in lowland and coastal regions of Papua New Guinea (PNG), and 
      is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and
      Plasmodium ovale. Infection by P. vivax is attributed to distinct strains, VK210 
      and VK247, which differ in the sequence of the circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp). 
      Here, based upon sequence polymorphisms in pvcsp, we developed a post-PCR
      ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA) to
      distinguish these P. vivax strains. This diagnostic assay was designed to detect 
      the presence of both VK210 and VK247 P. vivax strains simultaneously in a
      high-throughput 96-well format. Using this assay, we analyzed human blood samples
      from the Wosera (n=703) and Mugil (n=986) regions to evaluate the prevalence of
      these P. vivax strains. VK210 and VK247 strains were found in both study sites.
      In the Wosera, single infections with VK210 strain were observed to be most
      common (41.7%), followed by mixed-strain (36.8%) and VK247 single-strain
      infections (21.5%). Similarly, in Mugil, VK210 single-strain infections were most
      common (51.6%), followed by mixed-strain (34.4%) and VK247 single-strain
      infections (14%). These results suggest that the distribution of P. vivax
      infections was similar between the two study sites. Interestingly, we observed a 
      non-random distribution of these two P. vivax strains, as mixed-strain infections
      were significantly more prevalent than expected in both study sites (Wosera and
      Mugil chi(2)p-value<0.001). Additionally, DNA sequence analysis of a subset of P.
      vivax infections showed that no individual pvcsp alleles were shared between the 
      two study sites. Overall, our results illustrate that PNG malaria-endemic regions
      harbor a complex mixture of P. vivax strains, and emphasize the importance of
      malaria control strategies that would be effective against a highly diverse
      parasite population.

AB  - The DNA amplification process can be a source of bias and artifacts, especially
      when amplifying genomic areas with extreme AT or GC content. The human malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum has an AT-rich genome, and some of its highly
      AT-rich regions have been shown to be refractory to polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) amplification. Biased amplification may lead to erroneous conclusions for
      studies investigating genome-wide gene expression, nucleosome position, and copy 
      number variation. Here we compare genome-wide nucleosome coverage in libraries
      amplified at three different extension temperatures and show that reduction in
      PCR extension temperature from 70 degrees C to 60 degrees C can greatly increase 
      the fraction of coverage at AT-rich regions of the P. falciparum genome. Our
      method will improve the efficiency and coverage in sequencing an AT-rich genome.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro gametocyte production of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
      Northern Thailand.
PG  - 317-23
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.10.003 [doi]
AB  - Understanding why some malaria-infected individuals are infective to mosquitoes
      while others are not, is of great importance when considering interventions to
      stop malaria transmission. Whether gametocytes are produced in every individual
      infected with Plasmodium falciparum remains unclear. Using a highly sensitive
      reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay, we attempted to detect gametocyte-specific 
      mRNA transcripts in isolates from Thai patients which newly adapted to continuous
      in vitro culture. We then compared the allelic types of the pfg377 gene between
      patient blood and culture-adapted parasites in order to determine whether the
      same parasite lines were producing gametocytes in vivo and in vitro. Transcripts 
      of pfg377 were detected in all parasite isolates and in the corresponding
      cultured isolates, revealing that all patients had gametocytes circulating in
      their blood at the time of sampling. For isolates in continuous in vitro culture,
      there was a match between pfg377 allelic types detected by PCR from genomic DNA
      (and thus indicative of the dominant allelic type of asexual parasites) and those
      detected by RT-PCR of mRNA (gametocyte-specific), whereas in freshly isolated
      patient blood there were some differences between the asexual parasite allelic
      type and that of the gametocytes in the same infection. Seven isolates contained 
      asexual stage parasites harbouring pfg377 alleles that were not detectable in
      gametocytes from the same infections, suggesting that some clones were not
      producing gametocytes at the time of sampling, or that they were below the level 
      of detection.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity maintained and amplified over 5 years of 
      a low transmission endemic in the Peruvian Amazon.
PG  - 1973-86
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msq311 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum entered into the Peruvian Amazon in 1994, sparking an
      epidemic between 1995 and 1998. Since 2000, there has been sustained low P.
      falciparum transmission. The Malaria Immunology and Genetics in the Amazon
      project has longitudinally followed members of the community of Zungarococha (N =
      1,945, 4 villages) with active household and health center-based visits each year
      since 2003. We examined parasite population structure and traced the parasite
      genetic diversity temporally and spatially. We genotyped infections over 5 years 
      (2003-2007) using 14 microsatellite (MS) markers scattered across ten different
      chromosomes. Despite low transmission, there was considerable genetic diversity, 
      which we compared with other geographic regions. We detected 182 different
      haplotypes from 302 parasites in 217 infections. Structure v2.2 identified five
      clusters (subpopulations) of phylogenetically related clones. To consider genetic
      diversity on a more detailed level, we defined haplotype families (hapfams) by
      grouping haplotypes with three or less loci differences. We identified 34
      different hapfams identified. The F(st) statistic and heterozygosity analysis
      showed the five clusters were maintained in each village throughout this time. A 
      minimum spanning network (MSN), stratified by the year of detection, showed that 
      haplotypes within hapfams had allele differences and haplotypes within a cluster 
      definition were more separated in the later years (2006-2007). We modeled hapfam 
      detection and loss, accounting for sample size and stochastic fluctuations in
      frequencies overtime. Principle component analysis of genetic variation revealed 
      patterns of genetic structure with time rather than village. The population
      structure, genetic diversity, appearance/disappearance of the different
      haplotypes from 2003 to 2007 provides a genome-wide "real-time" perspective of P.
      falciparum parasites in a low transmission region.

AB  - The major spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) consist of snRNA
      (U1, U2, U4 or U5) and several proteins which can be unique or common to each
      snRNP particle. The common proteins are known as Sm proteins; they are crucial
      for RNP assembly and nuclear import of spliceosomal RNPs. This paper reports
      detecting the interaction between Plasmodium falciparum snRNAs and Sm proteins,
      and the usual 5' trimethylated caps on the snRNAs, by immunoprecipitation with
      specific antibodies. Furthermore, an unusual poly(A) tail was detected on these
      non-coding RNAs.

TI  - Molecular assessment of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to antimalarial drugs in
      Papua New Guinea using an extended ligase detection reaction fluorescent
      microsphere assay.
PG  - 798-805
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00939-10 [doi]
AB  - Surveillance for Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance mutations is becoming an
      established tool for assessing antimalarial treatment effectiveness. We used an
      extended version of a high-throughput post-PCR multiplexed ligase detection
      reaction fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA) to detect single-nucleotide P.
      falciparum drug resistance polymorphisms in 402 isolates from children in Papua
      New Guinea (PNG) participating in an antimalarial treatment trial. There was a
      fixation of P. falciparum crt (pfcrt) K76T, pfdhfr C59R and S108N, and pfmdr1
      mutations (92%, 93%, 95%, and 91%, respectively). Multiple mutations were
      frequent. Eighty-eight percent of isolates possessed a quintuple mutation
      (underlined), SVMNT, NRNI, KAA, and YYSND, in codons 72 to 76 for pfcrt; 51, 59, 
      108, and 164 for pfdhfr; 540, 581, and 613 for pfdhps; and 86, 184, 1034, 1042,
      and 1246 for pfmdr1, and four of these carried the K540E pfdhps allele. The
      pfmdr1 D1246Y mutation was associated with PCR-corrected day 42 in vivo treatment
      failure in children allocated piperaquine-dihydroartemisinin (P = 0.004).
      Although the pfmdr1 NFSDD haplotype was found in only four isolates, it has been 
      associated with artemether-lumefantrine treatment failure in Africa. LDR-FMA
      allows the large-scale assessment of resistance-associated single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs). Our findings reflect previous heavy
      4-aminoquinoline/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine use in PNG. Since
      artemether-lumefantrine and piperaquine-dihydroartemisinin will become first- and
      second-line treatments, respectively, the monitoring of pfmdr1 SNPs appears to be
      a high priority.

TI  - Persistence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in infected pregnant Mozambican
      women after delivery.
PG  - 298-304
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00814-10 [doi]
AB  - Pregnant women are susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum parasites that sequester 
      in the placenta. The massive accumulation of infected erythrocytes in the
      placenta has been suggested to trigger the deleterious effects of malaria in
      pregnant women and their offspring. The risk of malaria is also high during the
      postpartum period, although mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are not
      known. Here, we aimed to identify host factors contributing to the risk of
      postpartum infections and to determine the origin of postpartum parasites by
      comparing their genotypes with those present at the time of delivery. To address 
      this, blood samples were collected at delivery (n = 402) and postpartum (n = 354)
      from Mozambican women enrolled in a trial of intermittent preventive treatment in
      pregnancy (IPTp). P. falciparum was detected by real-time quantitative PCR
      (qPCR), and the parasite merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) and msp-2 genes were
      genotyped. Fifty-seven out of 354 (16%) women were infected postpartum as
      assessed by qPCR, whereas prevalence by optical microscopy was only 4%. Risk of
      postpartum infection was lower in older women (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.15 to 0.81) and higher in women with a placental
      infection at delivery (OR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.19 to 8.08). Among 24 women with
      matched infections, 12 (50%) were infected postpartum with at least one parasite 
      strain that was also present in their placentas. These results suggest that
      parasites infecting pregnant women persist after delivery and increase the risk
      of malaria during the postpartum period. Interventions that reduce malaria during
      pregnancy may translate into a lower risk of postpartum infection.

TI  - Etiology and epidemiology of viral pneumonia among hospitalized children in rural
      Mozambique: a malaria endemic area with high prevalence of human immunodeficiency
      virus.
PG  - 39-44
LID - 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181f232fe [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of viruses in pediatric pneumonia remains poorly studied in 
      sub-Saharan Africa, where pneumonia-associated mortality is high. METHODS: During
      a 1-year hospital-based surveillance, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was
      collected from children aged <5 years admitted to hospital in rural Mozambique
      with clinically severe pneumonia. Identification of 12 respiratory viruses was
      performed by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Study children were also tested
      for invasive bacterial infection (IBI), Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, and
      HIV. RESULTS: Almost half (394/807) of the children hospitalized with clinically 
      severe pneumonia had at least one respiratory virus detected. A total of 475
      viruses were detected among these 394 children, the most prevalent ones were
      rhinovirus (41%), adenovirus (21%), and respiratory syncytial virus (11%). Eleven
      percent of viral infected children had concomitant IBI, 15% had malaria
      parasites, and 25% had HIV coinfection. Viral infection was 5.5 to 16 times more 
      prevalent among HIV-infected children and incidence rate ratios varied according 
      to virus. Inhospital mortality of viral cases was 9%, being highest among cases
      with IBI coinfection (odds ratio = 7) or HIV infection (odds ratio = 7).
      CONCLUSIONS: Study results highlight the high prevalence of respiratory viruses
      among hospitalized pneumonia cases in Mozambique. HIV infection is an important
      contributor to the high burden of disease and associated mortality of viral
      pneumonia. IBI also contributes to a worse prognosis of viral cases. Strategies
      to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV as well as introduction of Hib and
      pneumococcal vaccines could have a substantial impact on reduction of viral
      pneumonia and associated mortality among children in rural Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions occur in 0.12% of
      transfusions, usually during transfusion or within 4 to 6 hours after transfusion
      and are not medically dangerous. CASE REPORT: A patient with thalassemia from
      Togo with asymptomatic malaria in which the infection became clinically manifest 
      only after blood transfusion, mimicking a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion
      reaction, is presented. Thirty-two hours after transfusion of 2 O D- red blood
      cell (RBC) units, the patient (phenotype A(2) D+) developed fever and multiorgan 
      failure and was admitted to the intensive care unit. Direct and indirect
      antiglobulin tests were negative on posttransfusion samples. Blood cultures and
      infectious diseases testing were negative. No malaria parasites were found at
      thick blood smear microscopic examination on Days 1 and 2 and the malaria rapid
      diagnostic test gave inconsistent results. Plasmodium total antibodies were
      detected in the serum at high levels. On Day 5, routine microscopic examination
      of blood smear revealed the presence of parasites in a very small number of RBCs.
      This finding was almost simultaneous to the availability of polymerase chain
      reaction testing results that were positive for P. falciparum. The sequential
      agglutination with anti-A antiserum allowed patient's and donors' RBCs to be
      separated and revealed that the parasitized cells were almost exclusively those
      of donors (14.4% vs. 0.029%). Malaria infection in implicated donors was
      excluded. CONCLUSION: In this patient with thalassemia with asymptomatic malaria,
      the infusion of two normal RBC units provided a favorable environment for a rapid
      parasite replication leading to a dramatic acute malaria attack.

AB  - Although microscopy remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis,
      molecular tools are attracting increasing interest. To improve the detection of
      mixed infections, we developed a four-primer real-time PCR with four Plasmodium
      species-specific forward primers, based on the pan-primer design with universal
      Plasmodium primers as described previously. After validation for analytical
      sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, the four-primer PCR was evaluated
      on 351 blood samples from patients presenting at the outpatient clinic of the
      Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium). With the four-primer PCR, we identified
      188 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), 54 Plasmodium vivax (Pv), 52 Plasmodium ovale
      (Po) and 13 Plasmodium malariae (Pm) single infections, 27 mixed infections (14
      Pf + Pm; 12 Pf + Po; one Pv + Pm) and 17 negative specimens. We found lower cycle
      threshold values than with the pan-primer PCR, with a mean difference of 2.23, a 
      higher analytical sensitivity (in asexual parasites/muL: Pf/Pv, 0.02; Po, 0.004; 
      Pm, 0.006) and 15 extra mixed infections. As compared with microscopy, 17 extra
      mixed infections were detected and Plasmodium species were identified in four
      microscopy-positive samples in which species identification was not possible.
      Additionally, the PCR corrected 13 species mismatches between Po and Pv, and in
      11 cases detected Pf as a second species that was not identified by microscopy
      and in five of them was not detected by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). PCR
      confirmed the presence of Pf in 30/46 histidine-rich protein-2-positive samples
      that were microscopy-negative. We conclude that the presently developed
      four-primer real-time PCR is complementary to standard malaria diagnostic tests
      in clinical laboratories, with an added value for simultaneous identification of 
      the four Plasmodium species and the detection of mixed infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study attempts to evaluate and compare the efficacy of
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative buffy coat (QBC) assay with
      conventional Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear (PBS) examination in the
      diagnosis of malaria. METHODS: The study was conducted on 50 cases of smear
      positive malaria (group 1), 50 cases of clinically suspected malaria (group 2)
      and 15 healthy controls. All were subjected to Giemsa stain slide examination
      both thick and thin smear, QBC assay and PCR. PBS examination by Giemsa stain was
      taken as gold standard. RESULT: In this study the overall sensitivity and
      positive predictive value (PPV) of QBC assay in group 1 was 100% and that of PCR 
      was 60% and 100% respectively. In group 2 the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
      NPV of QBC assay was 100% and that of PCR was 71%, 100%, 100% and 73%
      respectively as compared to the gold standard. All the 15 healthy controls were
      negative by all the three assays showing 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: QBC assay 
      was an excellent alternative to the conventional method as it is rapid and less
      time consuming and can directly demonstrate the parasite. Utility of PCR lies in 
      species-specific diagnosis of falciparum malaria especially when there is a high 
      degree of clinical suspicion and the report is negative by the other two methods.

AB  - Malaria is generally diagnosed by microscopy and rapid antigen testing. Molecular
      methods become more widely used. In the present study, the contribution of a
      quantitative multiplex malaria PCR was investigated. We assessed: (i) the
      agreement between PCR-based identification and microscopy and (ii) the
      correlation between the parasite load as determined by quantitative PCR and by
      microscopy. For 83 patients positive by microscopy for Plasmodium spp., the first
      EDTA-blood sample was tested by multiplex PCR to confirm smear-based species
      identification. Parasite load was assessed daily using both microscopy and PCR.
      Among the 83 patients tested, one was positive by microscopy only and 82 were
      positive by microscopy and PCR. Agreement between microscopy and PCR for the
      identification at the species level was 89% (73/82). Six of the nine discordant
      results corresponded to co-infections by two or three species and were attributed
      to inaccurate morphological identification of mixed cases. The parasite load
      generally decreased rapidly after treatment had been started, with similar decay 
      curves being obtained using both microscopy and PCR. Our PCR proved especially
      useful for identifying mixed infections. The quantification obtained by PCR
      closely correlated with microscopy-based quantification and could be useful for
      monitoring treatment efficacy, at least in clinical trials.
