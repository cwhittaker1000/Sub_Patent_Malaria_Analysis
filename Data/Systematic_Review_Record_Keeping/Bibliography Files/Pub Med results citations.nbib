TI  - A Direct from Blood Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for
      Monitoring Falciparum Malaria Parasite Transmission in Elimination Settings.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0039 [doi]
AB  - We describe a novel one-step reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (direct RT-PCR) 
      for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites that amplifies RNA targets directly
      from blood. We developed the assay to identify gametocyte-specific transcripts in
      parasites from patient blood samples, as a means of monitoring malaria parasite
      transmission in field settings. To perform the test, blood is added directly to a
      master mix in PCR tubes and analyzed by real-time PCR. The limit of detection of 
      the assay on both conventional and portable real-time PCR instruments was 100
      parasites/mL for 18S rRNA, and 1,000 parasites/mL for asexual (PFE0065W) and
      gametocyte (PF14_0367, PFGEXP5) mRNA targets. The usefulness of this assay in
      field studies was explored in samples from individuals living in a
      high-transmission region in Cameroon. The sensitivity and specificity of the
      assay compared with a standard two-step RT-PCR was 100% for 18S rRNA on both
      conventional and portable instruments. For PF14_0367, the sensitivity and
      specificity were 85.7% and 70.0%, respectively, on the conventional instrument
      and 78.6% and 90%, respectively, on the portable instrument. The concordance for 
      assays run on the two instruments was 100% for 18S rRNA, and 79.2% for PF14_0367,
      with most discrepancies resulting from samples with low transcript levels. The
      results show asexual and sexual stage RNA targets can be detected directly from
      blood samples in a simple one-step test on a field-friendly instrument. This
      assay may be useful for monitoring malaria parasite transmission potential in
      elimination settings, where sensitive diagnostics are needed to evaluate the
      progress of malaria eradication initiatives.

AB  - Understanding the epidemiology of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections
      is critical for countries to move toward malaria elimination. Using different
      methods for parasite detection, we evaluated how seasonality, spatial location,
      and other factors affect the age-specific epidemiology of asymptomatic malaria in
      Bongo District, Ghana. Asymptomatic prevalence by microscopy decreased
      significantly from 42.5% at the end of the wet to 27.5% at the end of the dry
      season (P < 0.001). Using the 18S rRNA polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), all
      microscopy-negative samples were screened and prevalence of submicroscopic
      infections also decreased significantly from the wet (55.4%) to the dry (20.7%)
      season (P < 0.001). Combining detection methods, 74.4% and 42.5% of the
      population in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, had evidence of a P.
      falciparum infection. Interestingly in those > 20 years of age, we found evidence
      of infection in 64.3% of the population in the wet and 27.0% in the dry season.
      Using both microscopy and PCR, the asymptomatic P. falciparum reservoir peaks at 
      the end of the wet season and infections in all age groups constitute the
      reservoir of malaria infection. At the end of the wet season, spatial
      heterogeneity in the prevalence and density of P. falciparum infections was
      observed between the two catchment areas surveyed in Bongo District. These
      results indicate that if elimination is to succeed, interventions will need to
      target not just P. falciparum infections in children but also in adults, and be
      implemented toward the end of the dry season in this area of West Africa.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0893 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum parasite life stages respond differently to antimalarial
      drugs. Sensitive stage-specific molecular assays may help to examine parasite
      dynamics at microscopically detectable and submicroscopic parasite densities in
      epidemiological and clinical studies. In this study, we compared the performance 
      of skeleton-binding protein 1 (SBP1), ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, 
      Hyp8, ring-exported protein 1 (REX1), and PHISTb mRNA for detecting ring-stage
      trophozoite-specific transcripts using quantitative reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction. Markers were tested on tightly synchronized in vitro
      parasites and clinical trial samples alongside established markers of parasite
      density (18S DNA and rRNA) and gametocyte density (Pfs25 mRNA). SBP1 was the most
      sensitive marker but showed low-level expression in mature gametocytes. Novel
      markers REX1 and PHISTb showed lower sensitivity but higher specificity for
      ring-stage trophozoites. Using in vivo clinical trial samples from
      gametocyte-negative patients, we observed evidence of persisting trophozoite
      transcripts for at least 14 days postinitiation of treatment. It is currently not
      clear if these transcripts represent viable parasites that may have implications 
      for clinical treatment outcome or transmission potential.

TI  - Characterizing the malaria rural-to-urban transmission interface: The importance 
      of reactive case detection.
PG  - e0005780
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005780 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reported urban malaria cases are increasing in Latin America,
      however, evidence of such trend remains insufficient. Here, we propose an
      integrated approach that allows characterizing malaria transmission at the
      rural-to-urban interface by combining epidemiological, entomological, and
      parasite genotyping methods. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A descriptive study that
      combines active (ACD), passive (PCD), and reactive (RCD) case detection was
      performed in urban and peri-urban neighborhoods of Quibdo, Colombia. Heads of
      households were interviewed and epidemiological surveys were conducted to assess 
      malaria prevalence and identify potential risk factors. Sixteen primary cases,
      eight by ACD and eight by PCD were recruited for RCD. Using the RCD strategy,
      prevalence of 1% by microscopy (6/604) and 9% by quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction (qPCR) (52/604) were found. A total of 73 houses and 289 volunteers were
      screened leading to 41 secondary cases, all of them in peri-urban settings (14%
      prevalence). Most secondary cases were genetically distinct from primary cases
      indicating that there were independent occurrences. Plasmodium vivax was the
      predominant species (76.3%, 71/93), most of them being asymptomatic (46/71).
      Urban and peri-urban neighborhoods had significant sociodemographic differences. 
      Twenty-four potential breeding sites were identified, all in peri-urban areas.
      The predominant vectors for 1,305 adults were Anopheles nuneztovari (56,2%) and
      An. Darlingi (42,5%). One An. nuneztovari specimen was confirmed naturally
      infected with P. falciparum by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence
      supporting the existence of urban malaria transmission in Quibdo. RCD strategy
      was more efficient for identifying malaria cases than ACD alone in areas where
      malaria transmission is variable and unstable. Incorporating parasite genotyping 
      allows discovering hidden patterns of malaria transmission that cannot be
      detected otherwise. We propose to use the term "focal case" for those primary
      cases that lead to discovery of secondary but genetically unrelated malaria cases
      indicating undetected malaria transmission.

      transmission intensities.
PG  - 130
LID - 10.1186/s12916-017-0893-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance and tolerance to Plasmodium falciparum can determine the
      progression of malaria disease. However, quantitative evidence of tolerance is
      still limited. We investigated variations in the adverse impact of P. falciparum 
      infections among African pregnant women under different intensities of malaria
      transmission. METHODS: P. falciparum at delivery was assessed by microscopy,
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) and placental histology in 946 HIV-uninfected and 768
      HIV-infected pregnant women from Benin, Gabon, Kenya and Mozambique. Resistance
      was defined by the proportion of submicroscopic infections and the levels of
      anti-parasite antibodies quantified by Luminex, and tolerance by the relationship
      of pregnancy outcomes with parasite densities at delivery. RESULTS: P. falciparum
      prevalence by qPCR in peripheral and/or placental blood of HIV-uninfected
      Mozambican, Gabonese and Beninese women at delivery was 6% (21/340), 11% (28/257)
      and 41% (143/349), respectively. The proportion of peripheral submicroscopic
      infections was higher in Benin (83%) than in Mozambique (60%) and Gabon (55%; P =
      0.033). Past or chronic placental P. falciparum infection was associated with an 
      increased risk of preterm birth in Mozambican newborns (OR = 7.05, 95% CI 1.79 to
      27.82). Microscopic infections were associated with reductions in haemoglobin
      levels at delivery among Mozambican women (-1.17 g/dL, 95% CI -2.09 to -0.24) as 
      well as with larger drops in haemoglobin levels from recruitment to delivery in
      Mozambican (-1.66 g/dL, 95% CI -2.68 to -0.64) and Gabonese (-0.91 g/dL, 95% CI
      -1.79 to -0.02) women. Doubling qPCR-peripheral parasite densities in Mozambican 
      women were associated with decreases in haemoglobin levels at delivery (-0.16
      g/dL, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02) and increases in the drop of haemoglobin levels
      (-0.29 g/dL, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14). Beninese women had higher anti-parasite IgGs
      than Mozambican women (P < 0.001). No difference was found in the proportion of
      submicroscopic infections nor in the adverse impact of P. falciparum infections
      in HIV-infected women from Kenya (P. falciparum prevalence by qPCR: 9%, 32/351)
      and Mozambique (4%, 15/417). CONCLUSIONS: The lowest levels of resistance and
      tolerance in pregnant women from areas of low malaria transmission were
      accompanied by the largest adverse impact of P. falciparum infections.
      Exposure-dependent mechanisms developed by pregnant women to resist the infection
      and minimise pathology can reduce malaria-related adverse outcomes.
      Distinguishing both types of defences is important to understand how reductions
      in transmission can affect malaria disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      Review of Literature.

AB  - Malaria is a major worldwide public health problem. In the last years, no
      domestic cases of malaria have been detected and cases of imported malaria exist 
      only in Turkey. In this study, clinical and laboratory findings of five
      Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria patients who were admitted to the
      emergency department between January 2013 and December 2015 were retrospectively 
      presented. One of the patients was an African student, and the other patients had
      a history of travelling to Africa. Ring formation was observed when Giemsa
      staining was performed on the blood smears of all patients, and in three
      patients, P. falciparum was also detected using multiplex polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) (Bio-Rad, United States of America). P. falciparum was not
      detected by PCR in the other two patients. Malaria should be primarily considered
      in febrile patients who have a history of travelling to endemic regions, and
      peripheral blood smears should definitely be examined.

TI  - RANTES levels as a determinant of falciparum malaria severity or recovery.
LID - 10.1111/pim.12452 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The study explored the role of differential RANTES concentrations, its
      receptor CCR5 expression, and resulting immunomodulation in the pathogenesis
      and/or recovery from falciparum malaria METHODS: The study population included
      cases of uncomplicated malaria (UC-M, N=128, enrolled on follow-up basis), severe
      malaria (SM, N=25), and healthy controls (N=112). Serum RANTES and TNF-alpha
      levels were evaluated by ELISA. Monocyte levels and activation profile was
      studied by flowcytometry. Differential mRNA expression profile was studied by
      Realtime-PCR. Blood parasite count was evaluated by registered pathologists
      RESULTS: RANTES concentration was significantly down-regulated in SM cases
      compared to UC-M (p=0.046) and controls (p<0.001). Expression of monocyte marker 
      mCD14, activation markers CCR5 and CD40, and downstream effector cytokine
      TNF-alpha were significantly higher in malaria cases compared to controls; in SM 
      cases compared to UC-M. TNF-alpha expression correlated positively with CD40 and 
      CCR5 expression. Follow-up based analysis showed that RANTES concentrations
      increased on recovery compared to baseline in UC-M cases (p=0.106); and inversely
      correlated with malaria parasite load, mCD14, CCR5 and CD40, and TNF-alpha
      expression CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggests an important association of RANTES 
      concentrations in P falciparum malaria disease pathogenesis, as well as recovery,
      mediated through differential modulation and regulated activation of monocytes
      and cytokine TNF-alpha. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests by community health workers in Afghanistan:
      cluster randomised trial.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12916-017-0891-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends parasitological
      diagnosis of malaria before treatment, but use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests 
      (mRDTs) by community health workers (CHWs) has not been fully tested within
      health services in south and central Asia. mRDTs could allow CHWs to diagnose
      malaria accurately, improving treatment of febrile illness. METHODS: A cluster
      randomised trial in community health services was undertaken in Afghanistan. The 
      primary outcome was the proportion of suspected malaria cases correctly treated
      for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed malaria and PCR negative cases
      receiving no antimalarial drugs measured at the level of the patient. CHWs from
      22 clusters (clinics) received standard training on clinical diagnosis and
      treatment of malaria; 11 clusters randomised to the intervention arm received
      additional training and were provided with mRDTs. CHWs enrolled cases of
      suspected malaria, and the mRDT results and treatments were compared to
      blind-read PCR diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 256 CHWs enrolled 2400 patients with
      2154 (89.8%) evaluated. In the intervention arm, 75.3% (828/1099) were treated
      appropriately vs. 17.5% (185/1055) in the control arm (cluster adjusted risk
      ratio: 3.72, 95% confidence interval 2.40-5.77; p < 0.001). In the control arm,
      85.9% (164/191) with confirmed Plasmodium vivax received chloroquine compared to 
      45.1% (70/155) in the intervention arm (p < 0.001). Overuse of chloroquine in the
      control arm resulted in 87.6% (813/928) of those with no malaria (PCR negative)
      being treated vs. 10.0% (95/947) in the intervention arm, p < 0.001. In the
      intervention arm, 71.4% (30/42) of patients with P. falciparum did not receive
      artemisinin-based combination therapy, partly because operational sensitivity of 
      the RDTs was low (53.2%, 38.1-67.9). There was high concordance between recorded 
      RDT result and CHW prescription decisions: 826/950 (87.0%) with a negative test
      were not prescribed an antimalarial. Co-trimoxazole was prescribed to 62.7% of
      malaria negative patients in the intervention arm and 15.0% in the control arm.
      CONCLUSIONS: While introducing mRDT reduced overuse of antimalarials, this action
      came with risks that need to be considered before use at scale: an appreciable
      proportion of malaria cases will be missed by those using current mRDTs. Higher
      sensitivity tests could be used to detect all cases. Overtreatment with
      antimalarial drugs in the control arm was replaced with increased antibiotic
      prescription in the intervention arm, resulting in a probable overuse of
      antibiotics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01403350 . Prospectively

PG  - 4717
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-05025-5 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion are main targets 
      of acquired immunity and important vaccine candidates. We hypothesized that
      anti-parasite immunity acquired upon exposure would limit invasion-related gene
      (IRG) expression and affect the clinical impact of the infection. 11 IRG
      transcript levels were measured in P. falciparum isolates by RT-PCR, and IgG/IgM 
      against invasion ligands by Luminex(R), in 50 Mozambican adults, 25 children with
      severe malaria (SM) and 25 with uncomplicated malaria (UM). IRG expression
      differences among groups and associations between IRG expression and
      clinical/immunologic parameters were assessed. IRG expression diversity was
      higher in parasites infecting children than adults (p = 0.022). eba140 and ptramp
      expression decreased with age (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively) whereas p41
      expression increased (p = 0.022). pfrh5 reduction in expression was abrupt early 
      in life. Parasite density decreased with increasing pfrh5 expression (p < 0.001) 
      and, only in children, parasite density increased with p41 expression (p =
      0.007), and decreased with eba175 (p = 0.013). Antibody responses and IRG
      expression were not associated. In conclusion, IRG expression is associated with 
      age and parasite density, but not with specific antibody responses in the acute
      phase of infection. Our results confirm the importance of multi-antigen vaccines 
      development to avoid parasite immune escape when tested in malaria-exposed
      individuals.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations in southeast and western
      Myanmar.
PG  - 322
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-2254-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of malaria parasites reflects the complexity
      and size of the parasite populations. This study was designed to explore the
      genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations collected from two
      southeastern areas (Shwekyin and Myawaddy bordering Thailand) and one western
      area (Kyauktaw bordering Bangladesh) of Myanmar. METHODS: A total of 267 blood
      samples collected from patients with acute P. falciparum infections during 2009
      and 2010 were used for genotyping at the merozoite surface protein 1 (Msp1), Msp2
      and glutamate-rich protein (Glurp) loci. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty four
      samples were successfully genotyped at three genes. The allelic distributions of 
      the three genes were all significantly different among three areas. MAD20 and 3D7
      were the most prevalent alleles in three areas for Msp1 and Msp2, respectively.
      The Glurp allele with a bin size of 700-750 bp was the most prevalent both in
      Shwekyin and Myawaddy, whereas two alleles with bin sizes of 800-850 bp and
      900-1000 bp were the most prevalent in the western site Kyauktaw. Overall, 73.91%
      of samples contained multiclonal infections, resulting in a mean multiplicity of 
      infection (MOI) of 1.94. Interestingly, the MOI level presented a rising trend
      with the order of Myawaddy, Kyauktaw and Shwekyin, which also paralleled with the
      increasing frequencies of Msp1 RO33 and Msp2 FC27 200-250 bp alleles. Msp1 and
      Msp2 genes displayed higher levels of diversity and higher MOI rates than Glurp. 
      PCR revealed four samples (two from Shwekyin and two from Myawaddy) with mixed
      infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. CONCLUSIONS: This study genotyped
      parasite clinical samples from two southeast regions and one western state of
      Myanmar at the Msp1, Msp2 and Glurp loci, which revealed high levels of genetic
      diversity and mixed-strain infections of P. falciparum populations at these
      sites. The results indicated that malaria transmission intensity in these regions
      remained high and more strengthened control efforts are needed. The genotypic
      data provided baseline information for monitoring the impacts of malaria
      elimination efforts in the region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has considerable effects on the pharmacokinetic properties 
      of drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The role of
      pharmacogenetic variation on anti-malarial drug disposition and efficacy during
      pregnancy is not well investigated. The study aimed to examine the effect of
      pharmacogenetics on lumefantrine (LF) pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in
      pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      were enrolled and treated with artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) at Mkuranga and
      Kisarawe district hospitals in Coast Region of Tanzania. Day-7 LF plasma
      concentration and genotyping forCYP2B6 (c.516G>T, c.983T>C), CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5
      (*3, *6, *7) and ABCB1 c.4036A4G were determined. Blood smear for parasite
      quantification by microscopy, and dried blood spot for parasite screening and
      genotyping using qPCR and nested PCR were collected at enrolment up to day 28 to 
      differentiate between reinfection from recrudescence. Treatment response was
      recorded following the WHO protocol. RESULTS: In total, 92 pregnant women in
      their second and third trimester were included in the study and 424 samples were 
      screened for presence of P. falciparum. Parasites were detected during the follow
      up period in 11 (12%) women between day 7 and 28 after treatment and PCR
      genotyping confirmed recrudescent infection in 7 (63.3%) women. The remaining
      four (36.4%) pregnant women had reinfection: one on day 14 and three on day 28.
      The overall PCR-corrected treatment failure rate was 9.0% (95% CI 4.4-17.4). Day 
      7 LF concentration was not significantly influenced by CYP2B6, CYP3A4*1B and
      ABCB1 c.4036A>G genotypes. Significant associations between CYP3A5 genotype and
      day 7 plasma LF concentrations was found, being higher in carriers of CYP3A5
      defective variant alleles than CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. No significant influence of 
      CYP2B6, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 c.4036A>Genotypes on malaria treatment outcome were
      observed. However, CYP3A4*1B did affect malaria treatment outcome in pregnant
      women followed up for 28 days (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in
      CYP3A4 and CYP3A5may influence LF pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in
      pregnant women.

TI  - Predominance of asymptomatic and sub-microscopic infections characterizes the
      Plasmodium gametocyte reservoir in the Peruvian Amazon.
PG  - e0005674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005674 [doi]
AB  - Malaria transmission requires that Anopheles mosquitoes ingest Plasmodium
      gametocyte stages circulating in the human bloodstream. In the context of malaria
      elimination, understanding the epidemiology of gametocytes relative to all
      Plasmodium infections and the contribution of asymptomatic and sub-microscopic
      parasite carriers to the gametocyte reservoir is necessary, especially in low
      endemic settings with predominance of P.vivax. A 13-month longitudinal study was 
      conducted in two communities (n = 1935 individuals) of Loreto Department, Peru,
      with five active screenings for Plasmodium infections and gametocyte stages by
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR,
      respectively. Parasite prevalence by qPCR was 7.2% for P.vivax (n = 520/7235;
      range by survey 6.0%-8.1%) and 3.2% for P.falciparum (n = 235/7235; range by
      survey 0.4%-7.7%). Sub-microscopic infections accounted for 73.5% of P.vivax
      (range by survey 60%-89%) and almost the totality of P.falciparum cases.
      Gametocytes were found in 28.4% P.vivax infections (range by survey 18.7%-34.1%),
      with a peak of 61.5% in one community at the start of the transmission season.
      About 59.8% of all P.vivax gametocyte carriers were asymptomatic and 31.9% were
      sub-microscopic. Age patterns for gametocyte prevalence paralleled asexual stage 
      infections and peaked among >15-25 year old individuals. Asexual parasite density
      was found to be the strongest predictor for P.vivax gametocyte presence in
      longitudinal multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2.33 [95% confidence interval
      1.96, 2.78]; P<0.001). Despite significant differences in seasonality patterns
      and P.vivax prevalence found at the local scale, sub-microscopic and asymptomatic
      infections predominate and contribute significantly to the gametocyte reservoir
      in different communities of the Peruvian Amazon. Control and elimination
      campaigns need sensitive tools to detect all infections that escape routine
      malaria surveillance, which may contribute to maintain transmission in the
      region.

TI  - A COMPARISON OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTING (BY PLASMODIUM LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE),
      AND QUANTITATIVE BUFFY COAT TECHNIQUE IN MALARIA DIAGNOSIS IN CHILDREN.
PG  - 31-38
LID - 10.21010/ajid.v11i2.5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) considers early and rapid
      diagnosis as one of the strategies to control malaria. This study compared the
      performance of Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) test and the Plasmodium lactate
      dehydrogenase (pLDH) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with microscopy as the gold
      standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved children ages 0-5 years who
      presented with a history of fever at the University College Hospital, Ibadan,
      Nigeria. Blood was collected from each patient and used for RDT, QBC and
      Giemsa-stained blood films for malaria parasites (MP). Results of QBC and RDT
      were compared with microscopy results for the diagnosis of malaria. RESULTS: A
      total of 370 cases (194 boys and 176 girls) were studied giving a male: female
      ratio of 1.1:1. Of the 370 cases tested using Giemsa-stained thick blood films
      for MP, 78 (21 %) were positive. For the QBC test, 78 (21%) of the cases were
      positive with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
      of 70.5 %, 92.1%, 70.5 % and 92.1 % respectively. Seventy-six (20%) of the cases 
      were positive by RDT with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
      predictive values of 84.2 %, 95.2 %, 82.1 %, and 95.9 % respectively. There was
      no significant difference in the sensitivity of QBC compared with the RDT.
      CONCLUSION: Both the QBC and the pfLDH (RDT) performed reasonably well in this
      study Malaria rapid diagnostic tests are recommended in malaria endemic clinical 
      settings to avoid unnecessary antimalarial treatment. List of Abbreviations: AO:

TI  - Minimal impact by antenatal subpatent P. falciparum infections on delivery
      outcomes in Malawian women: a cohort study.
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jix304 [doi]
AB  - Antenatal malaria screening with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and treatment only
      of RDT-positive women may potentially prevent low birthweight resulting from
      malaria. The consequences of subpatent antenatal infections below the detection
      limit of RDTs are incompletely understood. In Malawi, pregnant women of any
      gravidity were tested at each antenatal visit for P. falciparum using RDT and PCR
      and followed until delivery. Associations between antenatal infections and
      delivery outcomes were assessed with Poisson regression or ANOVA. Compared to
      women with no detected antenatal P. falciparum infections, women with
      RDT-positive infections delivered babies with lower mean birthweights: 2960 vs
      2867 grams[g] (mean difference[MD]: -93g; 95% confidence interval[CI]: -27,-159; 
      p=0.006); this was not observed among women with only subpatent infections (mean:
      3013g; MD: +54; 95% CI: -33,+140; p=0.2268). These differences were apparent
      early in pregnancy: At second trimester enrollment, compared to uninfected women,
      RDT-positive women delivered babies with lower mean birthweight (MD: -94g; 95%
      CI: -31,-156; p=0.003), but women with subpatent infections did not (MD: +36g;
      95% CI: -49,+122; p=0.409). Subpatent antenatal P. falciparum infections were not
      associated with adverse delivery outcomes. The association of patent infections
      at enrollment with low birthweight suggests the importance of early-pregnancy P. 
      falciparum prevention.

TI  - Detection of the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch-13 gene P553L mutation in
      sporozoites isolated from mosquito salivary glands in South-Central Vietnam.
PG  - 308
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-2247-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance against artemisinin in
      Southeast Asia. Mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch-13 (Pfk13) gene are
      associated with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the 
      prevalence of mutations in PfK13 from sporozoite-stage parasites isolated from
      the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus mosquitoes. METHODS: Mosquitoes were
      caught by human-landing catches at two locations within the Khanh Phu commune,
      South-Central Vietnam. Identification of Anopheles species was performed based on
      morphological features and nucleotide sequence analysis. Sporozoite-infected
      salivary glands were stored on filter paper and at 4-6 degrees C. A nested-PCR
      targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was used for Plasmodium species
      identification. Pfk13 was amplified by nested PCR, and subjected to nucleotide
      sequencing. RESULTS: Five of 33 P. falciparum sporozoite samples carried the
      P553L mutation at the PfK13 locus. This mutation has been recorded previously in 
      Vietnam, but not in Khanh Hoa province, were surveys of K13 polymorphism have not
      previously been carried out. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the utility of
      mosquito-stage malaria parasite samples for studies on the molecular epidemiology
      of drug resistance.

AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of macaques, has emerged as an important 
      parasite of humans. Despite the significance of P. knowlesi malaria in parts of
      Southeast Asia, very little is known about the genetic variation in this
      parasite. Our aim here was to explore sequence variation in a molecule called the
      42kDa merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), which is found on the surface of blood
      stages of Plasmodium spp. and plays a key role in erythrocyte invasion. Several
      studies of P. falciparum have reported that the C-terminus (a 42kDa fragment) of 
      merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-142; consisting of MSP-119 and MSP-133) is a
      potential candidate for a malaria vaccine. However, to date, no study has yet
      investigated the sequence diversity of the gene encoding P. knowlesi MSP-142
      (comprising Pk-msp-119 and Pk-msp-133) among isolates in Malaysia. The present
      study explored this aspect. Twelve P. knowlesi isolates were collected from
      patients from hospitals in Selangor and Sabah Borneo, Malaysia, between 2012 and 
      2014. The Pk-msp-142 gene was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Haplotype 
      diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (small el, Cyrillic) were studied among
      the isolates. There was relatively high genetic variation among P. knowlesi
      isolates; overall Hd and small el, Cyrillic were 1+/-0.034 and 0.01132+/-0.00124,
      respectively. A total of nine different haplotypes related to amino acid
      alterations at 13 positions, and the Pk-MSP-119 sequence was found to be more
      conserved than Pk-msp-133. We have found evidence for negative selection in
      Pk-msp-42 as well as the 33kDa and 19kDa fragments by comparing the rate of
      non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions. Future investigations should
      study large numbers of samples from disparate geographical locations to
      critically assess whether this molecule might be a potential vaccine target for
      P. knowlesi.

TI  - Identification of the Plasmodium species in clinical samples from children
      residing in five epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/s41182-017-0058-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in Cameroon was previously known to be caused solely by
      Plasmodium falciparum but today, evidence points to other Plasmodium species
      including P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. The purpose of this study was to
      identify the Plasmodium species in clinical samples from children residing in
      five epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon, so as to advise control
      policies. METHODS: One thousand six hundred nine febrile children (</=15 years)
      were recruited from five epidemiological strata of malaria including the
      Sudano-sahelian (SS) strata, the High inland plateau (HIP) strata, the South
      Cameroonian Equatorial forest (SCEF) strata, the High western plateau (HWP)
      strata and the Coastal (C) strata. Malaria parasites were detected by Giemsa
      microscopy (GM) while a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
      identify the Plasmodium species. Statistical analysis performed included the
      Pearson chi-square test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
      RESULTS: The PCR-adjusted prevalence of malaria was 17.6%. The detection rate of 
      PCR was higher than GM (p = 0.05). However, GM demonstrated a high sensitivity
      (85.5%) and specificity (100%) and, overall, a perfectly correlated agreement
      with PCR (97.5%). The prevalence of malaria was significantly higher in children 
      between 60 and 119 months (p < 0.001) and in Limbe (in the Coastal strata) (p <
      0.001). Contrariwise, the prevalence of malaria was not associated with gender (p
      = 0.239). P. falciparum was identified in all (100%) the cases of malaria; P.
      ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi were all absent. No case of mixed
      infection was identified. CONCLUSIONS: P. falciparum was the only species causing
      clinical malaria in the target population, which is contrary to studies that have
      reported P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale as causing clinical malaria in
      Cameroon.

AB  - Humanized mouse models present an important tool for preclinical evaluation of
      new vaccines and therapeutics. Here we show the human variable repertoire of
      antibody sequences cloned from a previously described human immune system (HIS)
      mouse model that possesses functional human CD4+ T cells and B cells, namely
      HIS-CD4/B mice. We sequenced variable IgG genes from single memory B-cell and
      plasma-cell sorted from splenocytes or whole blood lymphocytes of HIS-CD4/B mice 
      that were vaccinated with a human plasmodial antigen, a recombinant Plasmodium
      falciparum circumsporozoite protein (rPfCSP). We demonstrate that rPfCSP
      immunization triggers a diverse B-cell IgG repertoire composed of various human
      VH family genes and distinct V(D)J recombinations that constitute diverse CDR3
      sequences similar to humans, although low hypermutated sequences were generated. 
      These results demonstrate the substantial genetic diversity of responding human B
      cells of HIS-CD4/B mice and their capacity to mount human IgG class-switched
      antibody response upon vaccination.

      Haiti.
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12909 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of malaria in pregnancy in Haiti.
      METHODS: Cross-sectional study among pregnant women in six departments of Haiti. 
      After obtaining informed consent, whole blood samples and demographic surveys
      were collected to investigate malaria prevalence, anaemia and socio-behavioural
      risk factors for infection, respectively. A total of 311 pregnant women were
      screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT),
      microscopy and a novel, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction method (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Overall, 1.2% (4/311) of pregnant women were 
      tested positive for malaria infection by both microscopy and RDT. However, using 
      the qRT-PCR, 16.4% (51/311) of pregnant women were positive. The prevalence of
      malaria infection varied with geographical locations ranging between 0% and
      46.4%. Additionally, 53% of pregnant women had some form of anaemia; however, no 
      significant association was found between anaemia and submicroscopic malaria
      infection. The socio-behavioural risk factors identified to be protective of
      malaria infection were marital status (P < 0.05) and travel within one month
      prior to screening (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to document
      the high prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infections among pregnant women in 
      Haiti and identify social and behavioural risk factors for disease transmission.

AB  - This study analyzed the four main polymorphisms of the genes in homocysteine
      metabolism in malaria patients. Forty-two randomly selected subjects, diagnosed
      positive for Plasmodium falciparum, were included. The four genotypes were
      detected by real-time PCR using the MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, MTR 2756A>G, and
      MTRR 66A>G detection kit (Sacace Biotechnologies REF: T01002-96-S). The results
      revealed frequencies of 90% 677CC, 10% 677CT, and 00% 677TT for MTHFR C677T;
      78.6% 1298AA, 19% 1298AC, and 2.4% 1298CC for MTHFR A1298C; 61.9% 2756AA, 33.3%
      2756AG, and 4.8% 2756GG for MTR A2756G; and 50% of 66AA, 45% of 66AG, and 5% of
      66GG for MTRR A66G. Correlations were found between A2756G MTR genotypes and
      parasitaemia (P = 0.02), MTRR A66G and hemoglobin genotypes (P = 0.009), and
      MTHFR A1298C and sex (P = 0.01). This study demonstrated for the first time an
      association between the A2756G MTR alleles and Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      Burkina Faso and gave an overview of the genotypic distribution of the major SNPs
      influencing the metabolism of homocysteine.

TI  - Preferential suppression of Anopheles gambiae host sequences allows detection of 
      the mosquito eukaryotic microbiome.
PG  - 3241
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-03487-1 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium
      falciparum. The vector microbiota is a likely factor influencing parasite
      transmission. The prokaryotic microbiota of mosquitoes is efficiently surveyed by
      sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene.
      However, identification of the eukaryotic microbiota by targeting the 18s rRNA
      gene is challenging due to simultaneous amplification of the abundant 18s rRNA
      gene target in the mosquito host. Consequently, the eukaryotic microbial
      diversity of mosquitoes is vastly underexplored. An efficient methodology is
      needed to identify this component of the microbiota, expected to include
      relatives of Plasmodium. Here, we use defined panels of Anopheles samples from
      West Africa to test two experimental PCR clamp approaches to maximize the
      specific amplification of 18s rRNA gene hypervariable regions from eukaryotic
      microbes: anneal-inhibiting blocking primers and peptide-nucleic acid (PNA)
      oligonucleotide blockers. Of the two, PNA blockers were the only efficient
      blocking strategy, allowing a reduction of mosquito 18s rRNA gene sequences by
      more than 80% for the V4 hypervariable region. These PNA blockers will facilitate
      taxonomic profiling of the eukaryotic microbiota of the A. gambiae species
      complex, and contribute to a better understanding of microbial influence upon
      immunity and pathogen infection.

TI  - Burden and impact of Plasmodium vivax in pregnancy: A multi-centre prospective
      observational study.
PG  - e0005606
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite that over 90 million pregnancies are at risk of Plasmodium
      vivax infection annually, little is known about the epidemiology and impact of
      the infection in pregnancy. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a
      health facility-based prospective observational study in pregnant women from
      Guatemala (GT), Colombia (CO), Brazil (BR), India (IN) and Papua New Guinea PNG).
      Malaria and anemia were determined during pregnancy and fetal outcomes assessed
      at delivery. A total of 9388 women were enrolled at antennal care (ANC), of whom 
      53% (4957) were followed until delivery. Prevalence of P. vivax monoinfection in 
      maternal blood at delivery was 0.4% (20/4461) by microscopy [GT 0.1%, CO 0.5%, BR
      0.1%, IN 0.2%, PNG 1.2%] and 7% (104/1488) by PCR. P. falciparum monoinfection
      was found in 0.5% (22/4463) of women by microscopy [GT 0%, CO 0.5%, BR 0%, IN 0%,
      PNG 2%]. P. vivax infection was observed in 0.4% (14/3725) of placentas examined 
      by microscopy and in 3.7% (19/508) by PCR. P. vivax in newborn blood was detected
      in 0.02% (1/4302) of samples examined by microscopy [in cord blood; 0.05%
      (2/4040) by microscopy, and 2.6% (13/497) by PCR]. Clinical P. vivax infection
      was associated with increased risk of maternal anemia (Odds Ratio-OR, 5.48, [95% 
      CI 1.83-16.41]; p = 0.009), while submicroscopic vivax infection was not
      associated with increased risk of moderate-severe anemia (Hb<8g/dL) (OR, 1.16,
      [95% CI 0.52-2.59]; p = 0.717), or low birth weight (<2500g) (OR, 0.52, [95% CI, 
      0.23-1.16]; p = 0.110). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, the prevalence of
      P. vivax infection in pregnancy by microscopy was overall low across all endemic 
      study sites; however, molecular methods revealed a significant number of
      submicroscopic infections. Clinical vivax infection in pregnancy was associated
      with maternal anemia, which may be deleterious for infant's health. These results
      may help to guide maternal health programs in settings where vivax malaria is
      endemic; they also highlight the need of addressing a vulnerable population such 
      as pregnant women while embracing malaria elimination in endemic countries.

TI  - Single dose primaquine to reduce gametocyte carriage and Plasmodium falciparum
      transmission in Cambodia: An open-label randomized trial.
PG  - e0168702
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168702 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ, 0.25mg/kg) is recommended in
      combination with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a gametocytocide 
      to prevent Plasmodium falciparum transmission in areas threatened by artemisinin 
      resistance. To date, no randomized controlled trials have measured primaquine's
      effect on infectiousness to Anopheline mosquitoes in Southeast Asia. METHODS:
      Cambodian adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive
      a single 45mg dose of primaquine (equivalent to three SLD PQ) or no primaquine
      after the third dose of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DHP) therapy. A
      membrane-feeding assay measured infectiousness to Anopheles dirus on days 0, 3,
      7, and 14 of blood-stage therapy. Gametocytemia was evaluated by microscopy and
      reverse-transcriptase PCR. RESULTS: Prior to trial halt for poor DHP treatment
      efficacy, 101 participants were randomized and 50 received primaquine. Overall
      microscopic gametocyte prevalence was low (9%), but gametocytemic subjects given 
      primaquine were gametocyte-free by day 14, and significantly less likely to
      harbor gametocytes by day 7 compared to those treated with DHP-alone, who
      remained gametocytemic for a median of two weeks. Only one infectious subject was
      randomized to the primaquine group, precluding assessment of
      transmission-blocking efficacy. However, he showed a two-fold reduction in oocyst
      density of infected mosquitoes less than 24 hours after primaquine dosing. In the
      DHP-alone group, four subjects remained infectious through day 14, infecting
      roughly the same number of mosquitoes pre and post-treatment. Overall,
      microscopic gametocytemia was an excellent predictor of infectiousness, and
      performed better than submicroscopic gametocytemia post-treatment, with none of
      474 mosquitoes infected post-treatment arising from submicroscopic gametocytes.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a setting of established ACT resistance, a single dose of 45mg
      primaquine added to DHP rapidly and significantly reduced gametocytemia, while
      DHP-alone failed to reduce gametocytemia and prevent malaria transmission to
      mosquitoes. Continued efforts to make single dose primaquine widely available are
      needed to help achieve malaria elimination.

TI  - Carriage of sub-microscopic sexual and asexual Plasmodium falciparum stages in
      the dry season at Navrongo, Ghana.
PG  - 220-227
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the prevalence of sub-microscopic Plasmodium
      falciparum infections and gametocyte carriage in asymptomatic individuals in
      Navrongo in northern Ghana, an area of seasonal malaria transmission. DESIGN: A
      cross sectional study of 209 randomly selected participants of all age-groups was
      conducted in February and March, 2015. METHODS: Capillary blood samples collected
      from these individuals were used for the detection of both asexual and gametocyte
      stage parasites by microscopy, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) and conventional nested PCR methods. The prevalence data as determined
      by microscopy and molecular methods were compared using chi-square tests.
      RESULTS: Parasitaemia from these asymptomatic infections ranged from 40 to 3,520 
      parasites/microl of blood (geometric mean parasitaemia = 732 parasites/microl).
      The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage was 4.8% (10/209) and 13.9%
      (29/209) using microscopy and RT-PCR respectively. The overall prevalence of
      sub-microscopic infections in the total number of samples analysed was 9.1%
      (19/209) and 66% (19/29) of the asymptomatic infections. P. falciparum
      gametocytemia detected by microscopy was 1% (2/209) and 3.8% (8/209) by PCR.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first report of sub-microscopic asexual and gametocytes
      infections in the dry season in a seasonal malaria transmission area in Ghana. It
      has established that persistent latent malaria infections occur and that these
      could supply the source of parasites for the next transmission season. The
      findings highlight the presence of sub-microscopic infections and therefore the
      need for active case detection surveillance to eliminate "asymptomatic reservoir"
      parasites and consequently break the transmission of the disease in Ghana.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular tools for detecting malaria-infected mosquitoes with

      required. A common PCR technique used to detect mosquitoes infected with
      Plasmodium spp. is a nested PCR assay based on the 18s-rRNA gene. However, this
      technique has several technical limitations, is laborious and time consuming.
      METHODS: In this study, a PCR-based on the Plasmodium cytochrome oxidase I
      (COX-I) gene was compared with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR using serial dilutions
      (330-0.0012 pg) of DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium knowlesi and with DNA from 48 positive and negative Kenyan mosquitoes 
      (previously detected by using both ELISA and PCR). This assay for Plasmodium spp.
      DNA detection using the fast COX-I PCR assay was then performed individually on
      2122 field collected mosquitoes (from the Solomon Islands) in which DNA was
      extracted from head and thorax. RESULTS: The fast COX-I PCR assay took 1 h to run
      and consistently detected as low as to 0.043 pg of parasite DNA (equivalent to
      two parasites) in a single PCR, while analyses with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR
      required 4 h to complete with a consistent detection threshold of 1.5 pg of DNA. 
      Both assays produced concordant results when applied to the 48 Kenyan control
      samples with known Plasmodium spp. infection status. The fast COX-I PCR
      identified 23/2122 Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes from the Solomon Islands.
      CONCLUSIONS: This new COX-I PCR adapted for a single PCR reaction is a faster,
      simpler, cheaper, more sensitive technique amenable to high-throughput analyses
      for Plasmodium DNA detection in mosquitoes and is comparable to the 18s-rRNA
      nested PCR. The improved sensitivity seen with the fast COX-I PCR will improve
      the accuracy of mosquito infection rate determination.

TI  - Role of mass drug administration in elimination of Plasmodium falciparum malaria:
      a consensus modelling study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration for elimination of Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria is recommended by WHO in some settings. We used consensus modelling to
      understand how to optimise the effects of mass drug administration in areas with 
      low malaria transmission. METHODS: We collaborated with researchers doing field
      trials to establish a standard intervention scenario and standard transmission
      setting, and we input these parameters into four previously published models. We 
      then varied the number of rounds of mass drug administration, coverage, duration,
      timing, importation of infection, and pre-administration transmission levels. The
      outcome of interest was the percentage reduction in annual mean prevalence of P
      falciparum parasite rate as measured by PCR in the third year after the final
      round of mass drug administration. FINDINGS: The models predicted differing
      magnitude of the effects of mass drug administration, but consensus answers were 
      reached for several factors. Mass drug administration was predicted to reduce
      transmission over a longer timescale than accounted for by the prophylactic
      effect alone. Percentage reduction in transmission was predicted to be higher and
      last longer at lower baseline transmission levels. Reduction in transmission
      resulting from mass drug administration was predicted to be temporary, and in the
      absence of scale-up of other interventions, such as vector control, transmission 
      would return to pre-administration levels. The proportion of the population
      treated in a year was a key determinant of simulated effectiveness, irrespective 
      of whether people are treated through high coverage in a single round or new
      individuals are reached by implementation of several rounds. Mass drug
      administration was predicted to be more effective if continued over 2 years
      rather than 1 year, and if done at the time of year when transmission is lowest. 
      INTERPRETATION: Mass drug administration has the potential to reduce transmission
      for a limited time, but is not an effective replacement for existing vector
      control. Unless elimination is achieved, mass drug administration has to be
      repeated regularly for sustained effect. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates

TI  - Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus artesunate-amodiaquine for treatment of
      malaria infection in pregnancy in Ghana: an open-label, randomised,
      non-inferiority trial.
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12905 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) is
      non-inferior to artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) for treating uncomplicated malaria 
      infection in pregnancy. METHODS: A total of 417 second/ third trimester pregnant 
      women with confirmed asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia were
      randomised to receive DHA-PPQ or ASAQ over 3 days. Women were followed up on days
      1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 after treatment start and at delivery for
      parasitological, haematological, birth outcomes and at 6-week post-partum to
      ascertain the health status of the babies. Parasitological efficacy (PE) by days 
      28 and 42 were co-primary outcomes. Analysis was per-protocol (PP) and modified
      intention-to-treat (ITT). Non-inferiority was declared if the two-sided 95%
      confidence interval for PE at the endpoints excluded 5% lower efficacy for
      DHA-PPQ. Secondary outcomes were assessed for superiority. RESULTS: In PP
      analysis, PE was 91.6% for DHA-PPQ and 89.3% for ASAQ by day 28 and 89.0% and
      86.5%, respectively, by day 42. DHA-PPQ was non-inferior to ASAQ with respect to 
      uncorrected PE [adjusted difference by day 28 (DHA-PPQ-ASAQ); 3.5% (95%CI: -1.5, 
      8.5); and day 42: 3.9% (95%CI: -2.7, 10.4)]. ITT analysis gave similar results.
      PCR to distinguish recrudescence and reinfection was unsuccessful. DHA-PPQ
      recipients had fewer adverse events of vomiting, dizziness, and general weakness 
      compared to ASAQ. Both drugs were well-tolerated, and there was no excess of
      adverse birth outcomes. CONCLUSION: DHA-PPQ was non-inferior to ASAQ for
      treatment of malaria infection during pregnancy. No safety concerns were
      identified. Our findings contribute to growing evidence that DHA-PPQ is useful
      for control of malaria in pregnancy.

TI  - A method for the isolation and characterization of functional murine monoclonal
      antibodies by single B cell cloning.
LID - S0022-1759(17)30067-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jim.2017.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal antibody technologies have enabled dramatic advances in immunology,
      the study of infectious disease, and modern medicine over the past 40years.
      However, many monoclonal antibody discovery procedures are labor- and
      time-intensive, low efficiency, and expensive. Here we describe an optimized mAb 
      discovery platform for the rapid and efficient isolation, cloning and
      characterization of monoclonal antibodies in murine systems. In this platform,
      antigen-binding splenic B cells from immunized mice are isolated by FACS and
      cocultured with CD40L positive cells to induce proliferation and mAb production. 
      After 12days of coculture, cell culture supernatants are screened for antigen,
      and IgG positivity and RNA is isolated for reverse-transcription. Positive-well
      cDNA is then amplified by PCR and the resulting amplicons can be cloned into
      ligation-independent expression vectors, which are then used directly to
      transfect HEK293 cells for recombinant antibody production. After 4days of
      growth, conditioned medium can be screened using biolayer interferometry for
      antigen binding and affinity measurements. Using this method, we were able to
      isolate six unique, functional monoclonal antibodies against an antigen of the
      human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Importantly, this method
      incorporates several important advances that circumvent the need for single-cell 
      PCR, restriction cloning, and large scale protein production, and can be applied 
      to a wide array of protein antigens.

AB  - Genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum can be used to indicate the parasite's
      susceptibility to antimalarial drugs as well as its geographical origin. Both of 
      these factors are key to monitoring development and spread of antimalarial drug
      resistance. In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual
      indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP-profiling of 457 malaria
      infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying
      and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance-conferring SNPs
      occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of
      pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were
      sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the
      various SNP-positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8-100% of samples. The
      SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance-conferring SNPs in pfK13 are
      absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is
      found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and
      accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very
      reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes
      more affordable than ever before.

TI  - Malaria prevalence in asymptomatic and symptomatic children in Kiwangwa, Bagamoyo
      district, Tanzania.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria prevalence continues to decline across sub-Saharan Africa as 
      a result of various intervention strategies. However, the diseases still poses a 
      public health concern in the region. While symptomatic malaria is recognized and 
      treated, asymptomatic infections become increasingly important for interrupting
      transmission. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess malaria prevalence
      in symptomatic and asymptomatic children in Kiwangwa ward in Bagamoyo District in
      Tanzania. METHODS: Four hundred school-aged children in Kiwanga ward were
      recruited in the study; 200 from Kiwangwa dispensary and 200 from nearby schools.
      Primary health parameters were examined and blood samples collected and examined 
      for Plasmodium falciparum prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT), light
      microscopy (LM) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting
      transcripts of A-type 18s rRNA of P. falciparum. Gametocytes were detected by LM 
      and RT-qPCR targeting transcripts of gametocyte specific marker, Pfs25. RESULTS: 
      Overall P. falciparum prevalence was 73.3, 40.8 and 36.3% by RT-qPCR, RDT and LM 
      in the study area, respectively (P < 0.001). As expected symptomatic children had
      a significantly higher prevalence of 89, 67.5 and 64.5% by qPCR, RDT and LM,
      compared to 57.5, 14 and 8% in the asymptomatic group, respectively. However,
      gametocyte prevalence in asymptomatic individuals was higher by both LM (2%) and 
      qPCR (14%) than in symptomatic individuals LM (0.5%) and qPCR (3%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      A substantial difference in prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections
      observed in Kiwangwa ward underpins the use of molecular tools in malaria
      surveillance aiming at estimating prevalence and transmission. Notably, the
      higher gametocytaemia observed in asymptomatic children indicates the reservoir
      infections and points to the need for detection and treatment of both
      asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism of Merozoite Surface Protein-2 (MSP-2) in Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates from Pawe District, North West Ethiopia.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0177559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic regions, Plasmodium falciparum infection is
      characterized by extensive genetic diversity. Describing this diversity provides 
      important information about the local malaria situation. This study was conducted
      to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity of P. falciparum in Pawe district,
      North West Ethiopia, using the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2
      gene. METHODS: Atotal of 92 isolates from patients with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum attending Pawe Health Centre were collected from September to December
      2013. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex method and analyzed by length
      polymorphism following gel electrophoresis of DNA products from nested PCR of
      msp2 (block 3), targeting allelic families of FC27 and 3D7/IC. RESULTS: There
      were twenty-two different msp2 alleles, 11 corresponding to the 3D7/ IC and 11 to
      the FC27 allelic family. The frequency of isolates of the msp2 3D7/IC allelic
      familywas higher (51%) compared to FC27 (49%). The majority of the isolates (76%)
      contained multiple infections andthe overall mean multiplicity of infection was
      2.8 (CI 95% 2.55-3.03). The heterozygosity index was 0.66 for msp2. There was no 
      statically significant difference in the multiplicity of infection by age or
      parasite density. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that P.falciparum
      polymorphismsare extensive in Northwest Ethiopia and most of the infections are
      composed of multiple clones.

AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of
      the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective
      female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United
      States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria
      transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not
      traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products,
      congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne
      transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify 
      episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for
      travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of 
      illness in 2014 and trends during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria 
      cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic
      tests are reported to local and state health departments by health care providers
      or laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health 
      departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria
      Surveillance System, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, or direct 
      CDC consultations. CDC conducts antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on
      blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health
      departments. Data from these reporting systems serve as the basis for this
      report. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 1,724 confirmed malaria cases, including
      one congenital case and two cryptic cases, with onset of symptoms in 2014 among
      persons in the United States. The number of confirmed cases in 2014 is consistent
      with the number of confirmed cases reported in 2013 (n = 1,741; this number has
      been updated from a previous publication to account for delayed reporting for
      persons with symptom onset occurring in late 2013). Plasmodium falciparum, P.
      vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae were identified in 66.1%, 13.3%, 5.2%, and 2.7% 
      of cases, respectively. Less than 1.0% of patients were infected with two
      species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 11.7% of cases. 
      CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 14.2% of confirmed cases and tested 12.0% 
      of P. falciparum specimens for antimalarial resistance markers. Of patients who
      reported purpose of travel, 57.5% were visiting friends and relatives (VFR).
      Among U.S. residents for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel
      region was known, 7.8% reported that they initiated and adhered to a
      chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to which they
      had traveled. Thirty-two cases were among pregnant women, none of whom had
      adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported cases, 17.0% were classified as
      severe illness, and five persons with malaria died. CDC received 137 P.
      falciparum-positive samples for the detection of antimalarial resistance markers 
      (although some loci for chloroquine and mefloquine were untestable for up to nine
      samples). Of the 137 samples tested, 131 (95.6%) had genetic polymorphisms
      associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 96 (70.0%) with sulfadoxine
      resistance, 77 (57.5%) with chloroquine resistance, three (2.3%) with mefloquine 
      drug resistance, one (<1.0%) with atovaquone resistance, and two (1.4%) with
      artemisinin resistance. INTERPRETATION: The overall trend of malaria cases has
      been increasing since 1973; the number of cases reported in 2014 is the fourth
      highest annual total since then. Despite progress in reducing global prevalence
      of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many regions and use of appropriate
      prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION:
      Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased slightly in
      2014 compared with 2013, but still remains unacceptably low. In 2014, at least
      one essential element (i.e., species, travel history, or resident status) was
      missing in 21.3% of case report forms. Incomplete reporting compromises efforts
      to examine trends in malaria cases and prevent infections. VFR travelers continue
      to be a difficult population to reach with effective malaria prevention
      strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies that effectively target VFR
      travelers need to be developed and implemented to have a substantial impact on
      the number of imported malaria cases in the United States. Fewer U.S. resident
      patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis in 2014 (27.2%) compared with 2013
      (28.6%), and adherence was poor among those who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper
      use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will prevent the majority of malaria illnesses
      and reduce risk for severe disease
      (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be
      fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications
      appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, likely country of malaria 
      acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent molecular 
      laboratory advances have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular
      surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers
      (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) and improve the ability of CDC to
      track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both
      domestically and globally. For this effort to be successful, specimens should be 
      submitted for all cases diagnosed in the United States. Clinicians should consult
      CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC 
      Malaria Hotline for case management advice, when needed. Malaria treatment
      recommendations can be obtained online at
      https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/ or by calling the Malaria
      Hotline at 770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1), P.
      falciparum Ca2+-ATPase (PfATP6) and Kelch-13 propeller domain (PfK13) loci are
      molecular markers of parasite susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs. Their
      frequency distributions were determined in the isolates collected from children
      with severe malaria originating from three African countries. METHODS: Samples
      from 287 children with severe malaria [(Gabon: n = 114); (Ghana: n = 89); (Kenya:
      n = 84)] were genotyped for pfmdr1, pfatp6 and pfk13 loci by DNA sequencing and
      assessing pfmdr1 copy number variation (CNV) by real-time PCR. RESULTS:
      Pfmdr1-N86Y mutation was detected in 48, 10 and 10% in Lambarene, Kumasi and
      Kisumu, respectively. At codon 184, the prevalence of the mutation was 73% in
      Lambarene, 63% in Kumasi and 49% Kisumu. The S1034C and N1042D variants were
      absent at all three sites, while the frequency of the D1246Y mutation was 1, 3
      and 13% in Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. Isolates with two pfmdr1
      gene copy number predominantly harboured the N86Y wild-type allele and were
      mostly found in Kumasi (10%) (P < 0.0001). Among the main pfmdr1 haplotypes (NFD,
      NYD and YFD), NYD was associated with highest parasitaemia (P = 0.04). At the
      pfatp6 locus, H243Y and A623E mutations were observed at very low frequency at
      all three sites. The prevalence of the pfatp6 E431K variant was 6, 18 and 17% in 
      Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. The L263E and S769N mutations were
      absent in all isolates. The pfk13 variants associated with artemisinin resistance
      in Southeast Asia were not observed. Eleven novel substitutions in the pfk13
      locus occurring at low frequency were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinins are
      still highly efficacious in large malaria-endemic regions though declining
      efficacy has occurred in Southeast Asia. The return of chloroquine-sensitive
      strains following the removal of drug pressure is observed. However, selection of
      wild-type alleles in the multidrug-resistance gene and the increased gene copy
      number is associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity. This study indicates 
      a need to constantly monitor drug resistance to artemisinin in field isolates
      from malaria-endemic countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In India, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is now in use as a partner 
      drug of ACT (AS+SP) to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2010.
      Declined trend of AS+SP efficacy has been reported from north-eastern states of
      the country. It is not possible to determine the efficacy of SP alone from any
      study with ACT. So, this work was designed to study the pattern of polymorphisms 
      in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes to predict the SP resistance status among parasite
      population of urban Kolkata after five years of ACT implementation. METHODS: A
      total of 125 P. falciparum positive patients were enrolled in the study during
      December 2014 to July 2016 and treated with AS+SP. Parasitic DNA was isolated and
      subjected to sequencing of pfdhfr and pfdhps genes directly from purified PCR
      products. RESULTS: Genotyping of both the genes was successfully done in 113
      isolates. In pfdhfr, 94.69% (107/113) isolates showed mutations at codon 59 and
      108. A double mutant genotype ANRNI was mostly prevalent (107/113, 94.69%), while
      wild-type genotype ANCSI was found only in 5.3% (6/113) isolates. In pfdhps,
      mutations were recorded at codon 436 and 437 in 65.49% (74/113) and 23.01%
      (26/113) isolates, respectively. In combined pfdhfr-pfdhps genes, triple mutant
      ANRNI-FAKAA was most prevalent (45/113, 39.82%) followed by double mutant
      ANRNI-SAKAA (37/113, 32.74%) and quadruple mutant ANRNI-FGKAA (24/113, 21.24%).
      CONCLUSION: SP resistance hallmark mutations i.e., quadruple (AIRNI-SAEAA) or
      quintuple (AIRNI-SGEAA) genotype in pfdhfr and pfdhps was absent which indicates 
      that SP components of used ACT is still effective in the study area. It is also
      evident by the clinical response of AS+SP. Monitoring the efficacy of this
      combination (both by therapeutic and molecular marker study) at a regular
      interval is highly suggested to record any development of SP resistance in near
      future.

TI  - Multiplex, DNase-free one-step reverse transcription PCR for Plasmodium 18S rRNA 
      and spliced gametocyte-specific mRNAs.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1863-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium gametocytes are sexual stages transmitted to female
      Anopheles mosquitoes. While Plasmodium parasites can be differentiated
      microscopically on Giemsa-stained blood smears, molecular methods are
      increasingly used because of their increased sensitivity. Molecular detection of 
      gametocytes requires methods that discriminate between asexual and sexual stage
      parasites. Commonly tested gametocyte-specific mRNAs are pfs25 and pfs230
      detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However,
      detection of these unspliced mRNA targets requires preceding DNase treatment of
      nucleic acids to eliminate co-purified genomic DNA. If gametocyte-specific,
      spliced mRNAs could be identified, DNase treatment could be eliminated and
      one-step multiplexed molecular methods utilized. RESULTS: Expression data was
      used to identify highly-expressed mRNAs in mature gametocytes that were also low 
      in antisense RNA expression in non-gametocyte stages. After testing numerous
      candidate mRNAs, the spliced female Pf3D7_0630000 mRNA was selected as a
      Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte-specific biomarker compatible with Plasmodium
      18S rRNA RT-PCR. This mRNA was only detected in samples containing mature
      gametocytes and was absent in those containing only asexual stage parasites or
      uninfected human blood. PF3D7_0630000 RT-PCR detected gametocytes across a wide
      range of parasite densities in both spiked and clinical samples and agreed with
      pfs25 RT-PCR, the gold standard for RT-PCR-based gametocyte detection.
      PF3D7_0630000 multiplexed with Plasmodium 18S rRNA RT-PCR was more sensitive than
      other spliced mRNA targets for one-step RT-PCR gametocyte detection. CONCLUSIONS:
      Because the spliced target does not require DNase treatment, the PF3D7_0630000
      assay can be multiplexed with Plasmodium 18S rRNA for direct one-step detection
      of gametocytes from whole human blood.

TI  - Diagnosing congenital malaria in a high-transmission setting: clinical relevance 
      and usefulness of P. falciparum HRP2-based testing.
PG  - 2080
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-02173-6 [doi]
AB  - Congenital malaria diagnosis is challenging due to frequently observed low
      parasite density infections, while their clinical relevance during early infancy 
      is not well characterized. In Nanoro health district (Burkina Faso), we
      determined the prevalence of congenital malaria by real-time quantitative PCR and
      we assessed the performance of rapid diagnosis test (RDT) and light microscopy
      (LM) to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections in cord-blood samples. In
      addition, we examined the usefulness of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein2
      (PfHRP2) as surrogate biomarker of infection and explored association between
      congenital malaria and clinical outcomes. A prevalence of congenital malaria by
      qPCR of 4% (16/400) was found, which increased to 10% among newborns from mothers
      infected at delivery. RDT and LM showed poor performances indicating limited
      utility for congenital malaria screening in cord blood. Because PfHRP2 detection 
      in cord blood could be affected by transplacental passage of parasite antigens,
      PfHRP2 might not be used as a surrogate biomarker of congenital malaria
      infections. There was no evidence of a significant clinical impact of congenital 
      malaria on infant's health from birth to 59 days of life. Case control studies
      including long-term follow up may provide additional understanding on the
      relevance of neonatal malaria infections.

      anti-Zika virus ELISA in malaria positive individuals among pregnant women from
      Madagascar in 2010.
PG  - e0176708
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0176708 [doi]
AB  - It was previously reported that a malaria infection may interfere with the
      specificity of a commercial ELISA test against Zika virus (ZIKV). We analyzed
      1,216 plasma samples from healthy, pregnant women collected in two sites in
      Madagascar in 2010 for ZIKV antibodies using a commercial ELISA and for
      Plasmodium infection by PCR. This screen revealed six putative ZIKV-positive
      samples by ELISA. These results could not be confirmed by indirect
      immunofluorescence assays or virus neutralization tests. Four of these six
      samples were also positive for P. falciparum. We noted that the frequency of
      malaria positivity was higher in ZIKV-ELISA positive samples (50% and 100% in the
      two study sites) than ZIKV-negative samples (17% and 10%, respectively),
      suggesting that malaria may have led to false ZIKV-ELISA positives.

TI  - Amplification of Mitochondrial DNA for detection of Plasmodiumvivax in
      Balochistan.
PG  - 677-681
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To access a new step using PCR to amplify the targeted mtDNA sequence 
      for detecting specifically Plasmodium vivax and its co-infections, false positive
      and false negative results with Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: In this study we 
      have standardized a new technical approach in which the target mitochondrial DNA 
      sequence (mtDNA) was amplified by using a PCR technique as a tool to detect
      Plasmodium spp. Species specific primers were designed to hybridize with
      cytochrome c oxidase gene of P. vivax (cox I) and P. falciparum (cox III). Two
      hundred blood samples were collected on the basis of clinical symptoms which were
      initially examined through microscopic analysis after preparing Giemsa stained
      thick and thin blood smears. Afterwards genomic DNA was extracted from all
      samples and was then subjected to PCR amplification by using species specific
      primers and amplified segments were sequenced for confirmation of results.
      RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-two blood samples were detected as positive for
      malaria by PCR, out of which 64 were found to be positive by PCR and 53 by both
      microscopy and PCR for P.vivax infection. Nine samples were found to be false
      negative, one P.vivax mono infection was declared as co infection by PCR and 3
      samples identified as having P.falciparum gametes were confirmed as P.vivax by
      PCR amplification. Sensitivity and specificity were found to be 85% and 92%
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained through PCR method were comparatively
      better and reliable than microscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The indoor residual spraying programme for malaria vectors control
      was implemented in four districts of the Lake Victoria basin of Tanzania namely
      Ukerewe, Sengerema, Rorya andSerengeti. Entomological monitoring activities were 
      implemented in one sentinel village in each district to evaluate the efficacy of 
      pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS sprayed on different wall surfaces and its impact
      against malaria vectors post-IRS intervention. METHODS: The residual decay rate
      of p-methyl 300 CS applied at a target dosage of 1g a.i./m2 on thesprayed wall
      surfaces was monitored for a period of 43 weeks post-IRSusing the WHO cone wall
      bioassay method. The bioassays were performed by exposing 2-5 days old unfed
      susceptible female Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Kisumu strain) to sprayed wall
      surfaces for a period of 30 minutes. In each sentinel village, mosquito
      collection was carried out by trained community mosquito collectors. Monthly
      mosquito collections were carried out from 6.00pm to 6.00am using CDC light traps
      and clay pot methods for indoors host seekingand outdoors resting mosquitoes
      respectively. Six traps (2 CDC light traps and 4 clay pots) were set per sentinel
      village per night for28 consecutive days in a moon. PCR and ELISA were used for
      mosquito species identification and sporozoite detection, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Based on the WHOPES recommendation, insecticides should have a minimum efficacy
      of >/= 80% mosquito mortality at 24 hours post exposure on the sprayed wall
      surfaces to be considered effective. In this study, p-methyl 300 CS was
      demonstrated to have a long residual efficacy of 21-43 weeks post-IRS on mud,
      cement, painted and wood wall surfaces. Numberof anopheline mosquitoes decreased 
      post-IRS interventions in all sentinel villages. The highest numbers ofanopheline
      mosquitoes were collected in November-December, 38-43 weeks post-IRS. A total of 
      270 female anopheline mosquitoes were analyzed by PCR; out of which 236 (87.4%)
      were An. gambiae s.l. and 34 (12.6%) were An. funestus group. Of the 236 An.
      gambiae s.l.identified 12.6% (n = 34) were An. gambiae s.s. and 68.6% (n = 162)
      were An. arabiensis. Ofthe 34 An. funestus group indentified 91.2% (n = 31) were 
      An. parensis and 8.8% (n = 3) were An. rivulorum. The overall Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoite rate was 0.7% (n = 2,098). CONCLUSIONS: Pirimiphos-methyl
      300 CS was found to be effective for IRS in the Lake Victoria basin,Tanzania.
      P-methyl 300 CShas a long residual efficacy on sprayed wall surfaces and
      therefore it is effective in controlling principal malaria vectors of An. gambiae
      s.l and An. funestus which rest on wall surfaces after and before feeding.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study was designed to investigate the association
      between rs8177374 polymorphism and malaria symptoms due to exposure of Plasmodium
      vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 454 samples
      were included in the study (228 malaria patients and 226 healthy individuals).
      Malaria patients, divided into P. vivax and P. falciparum groups on the basis of 
      the causative species of Plasmodium, were categorized into mild and severe on the
      basis of clinical outcomes according to WHO criteria. Healthy individuals were
      used as controls. Allele specific PCR based strategy was used for the
      identification of rs8177374 SNP. RESULTS: MyD88-adaptor-like gene polymorphism
      was associated with susceptibility to malaria (p<0.001). C allele frequency
      (0.74) was higher in the population compared to T allele frequency (0.26). CT
      genotype increased the susceptibility of malaria (OR: 2.661; 95% CI: 1.722-4.113)
      and was positively associated with mild malaria (OR: 5.609; 95% CI: 3.479-9.044, 
      p=0.00). On the other hand, CC genotype was associated with severe malaria (OR:
      3.116; 95% CI: 1.560-6.224, p=0.00). P. vivax infection rate was higher in CT
      genotype carriers compared to other genotypes (OR: 3.616; 95% CI: 2.219-5.894,
      p<0.001). CONCLUSION: MyD88-adaptor-like/TIR domain containing adaptor protein
      polymorphism for single nucleotide polymorphism rs8177374 is related with the
      susceptibility of malaria.

AB  - Malaria is the second most prevalent disease in Pakistan resulting in ~30,000
      annual deaths. In endemic countries like Pakistan precise and timely diagnosis of
      malaria is imperative to overcome the associated risks of fatal outcomes.
      Malarial parasite was screened in 128 malaria suspected patients and 150 healthy 
      controls, by species-specific PCR, microscopy of blood smears, hemoanalyzer
      Sysmex XE-2100, and rapid test devices (First Response Malaria(R) and ICT Malaria
      Combo(R)). The microscopy detected MP in 126 samples (parasite load/microl
      386-53712/microl); 71.094% were infected with Plasmodium vivax and 14.844% with
      P. falciparum while 14.062% had mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum infection. The
      mean parasite load for P. vivax and P. falciparum was 14496/microl and
      24410/microl, respectively. The abnormal scattergrams of DIFF, WBC/ Baso, IMI
      channel, and RET-EXT on Sysmex XE-2100 supported 99.2% parasite detection,
      whereas only 93% of confirmed malaria cases were detected by both rapid tests.
      About 127 samples were positive by PCR. Since Sysmex XE-2100 automatically
      detected the presence of malarial parasite with high sensitivity, it can be a
      good option for presumptive diagnosis in endemic areas. Microscopy remains the
      gold standard to confirm MP in suspected patients. Rapid diagnostic tests have
      acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

      malaria parasites in endemic area.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1838-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a debilitating disease with high morbidity and mortality
      in Africa, commonly caused by different species of the genus Plasmodium in
      humans. Misdiagnosis is a major challenge in endemic areas because of other
      disease complications and technical expertise of the medical laboratory staff.
      Microscopic method using Giemsa-stained blood film has been the mainstay of
      diagnosis of malaria. However, since 1993 when rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits
      were introduced, they have proved to be effective in the diagnosis of malaria.
      This study was aimed at comparing the accuracy of microscopy and RDTs in the
      diagnosis of malaria using nested PCR as the reference standard. Four hundred and
      twenty (420) venous blood specimens were collected from patients attending
      different General Hospitals in Ebonyi State with clinical symptoms of malaria.
      The samples were tested with Giemsa-stained microscopy and three RDTs. Fifty
      specimens were randomly selected for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Using different
      diagnostic methods, the prevalence of malaria among the subjects studied was
      25.95% as detected by microscopy, prevalence found among the RDTs was 22.90,
      15.20 and 54.80% for Carestart, SD Bioline PF and SD Bioline PF/PV, respectively.
      Molecular assay yielded a prevalence of 32%. The major specie identified was
      Plasmodium falciparum; there was co-infection of P. falciparum with Plasmodium
      malariae and Plasmodium ovale. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was 
      50.00 and 70.59% while that of the RDTs were (25.00 and 85.29%), (25.00 and
      94.12%) and (68.75 and 52.94%) for Carestart, SD Bioline PF and SD Bioline PF/PV,
      respectively. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of
      agreement of the methods with nested PCR. Microscopy showed a moderate measure of
      agreement (k = 0.491), Carestart showed a good measure of agreement (k = 0.611), 
      SD Bioline PF showed a fair measure of agreement (k = 0.226) while SD Bioline
      PF/PV showed a poor measure of agreement (k = 0.172). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      recommends that the policy of malaria diagnosis be changed such that the routine 
      diagnosis of malaria is done by a combination of both microscopy and a RDT kit of
      high sensitivity and specificity so as to complement the errors associated with
      either of the methods. The finding of P. ovale in the study area necessitates an 
      expanded molecular epidemiology of malaria within the study area.

PG  - 1308
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-01506-9 [doi]
AB  - Commercial malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect P. falciparum histidine
      rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and cross react with PfHRP3, a structural homologue.
      Here, we analysed natural variations in PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 sequences from Indian
      isolates and correlated these variations with RDT reactivity. A total 1392 P.
      falciparum positive samples collected from eight endemic states were PCR
      amplified for Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes and were sequenced. The deduced protein
      sequences were analysed for repeat variations and correlated with RDT reactivity.
      Out of 1392 PCR amplified samples, a single sample was Pfhrp2 negative and two
      samples were Pfhrp3 negative. Complete Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 sequences were obtained 
      for 769 samples and 750 samples, respectively. A total of 16 distinct repeat
      motifs were observed for Pfhrp2 and 11 for Pfhrp3, including some new repeat
      types. No correlation was found between variations in the size of Pfhrp2 repeat
      types 2 and 7, nor between any combinations of repeat motifs, and performance of 
      a commercial RDT at low parasite densities. The findings suggest that sequence
      diversity in Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in Indian isolates is not likely to
      negatively influence performance of currently used PfHRP2 RDTs.

AB  - Recent reports regarding the re-emergence of parasite sensitivity to chloroquine 
      call for a new consideration of this drug as an interesting complementary tool in
      malaria elimination efforts, given its good safety profile and long half-life. A 
      randomized (2:1), single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in
      Manhica, Mozambique, to assess the in-vivo efficacy of chloroquine to clear
      plasmodium falciparum (Pf) asymptomatic infections. Primary study endpoint was
      the rate of adequate and parasitological response (ACPR) to therapy on day 28
      (PCR-corrected). Day 0 isolates were analyzed to assess the presence of the
      PfCRT-76T CQ resistance marker. A total of 52 and 27 male adults were included in
      the CQ and Placebo group respectively. PCR-corrected ACPR was significantly
      higher in the CQ arm 89.4% (95%CI 80-98%) compared to the placebo (p < 0.001). CQ
      cleared 49/50 infections within the first 72 h while placebo cleared 12/26 (LRT p
      < 0.001). The PfCRT-76T mutation was present only in one out of 108 (0.9%)
      samples at baseline, well below the 84% prevalence found in 1999 in the same
      area. This study presents preliminary evidence of a return of chloroquine
      sensitivity in Mozambican Pf isolates, and calls for its further evaluation in
      community-based malaria elimination efforts, in combination with other effective 
      anti-malarials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicalTrials.gov NCT02698748.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early and accurate diagnosis of imported malaria cases in clusters 
      is crucial for protecting the health of patients and local populations,
      especially confirmed parasitic persons who are asymptomatic. METHODOLOGY: A total
      of 226 gold miners who had stayed in highly endemic areas of Ghana for more than 
      six months and returned in clusters were selected randomly. Blood samples from
      them were tested with microscopy, nest polymerase chain reaction, and rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT). The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, agreement
      rate, and Youden's index of each of three diagnostic methods were calculated and 
      compared with the defined gold standard. A quick and efficient way to respond to 
      screening such a clustered mobile population was predicted and analyzed by
      evaluating two assumed results of combining microscopy and RDT with or without
      symptoms of illness. RESULTS: The rate of the carriers of malaria parasites in
      the populations of gold miners was 19.47%, including 39 P. falciparum. Among the 
      three diagnostic methods, the microscopy method showed the highest specificity,
      while the RDT method showed the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity in
      detecting P. falciparum. The assumed results of combining RDT and microscopy with
      symptoms showed the best results among all the test results in screening P.
      falciparum. CONCLUSIONS: It was too complex and difficult to catch all parasite
      carriers in a short period of time among populations with such a complicated
      situation as that in Shanglin County. A strategy of combing microscopy and RDT
      for diagnosis is highly recommended.

AB  - Problem. Congenital plasmodial infection (CPI) is a rare event, which has been
      little studied in Colombia. Objective. To measure the frequency of CPI and to
      describe the immune and histological characteristics in maternal blood and
      placentas when CPI occurs. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out
      in northwest Colombia. A sample size of 39 unit analysis (a unit of analysis
      corresponds to the cord, placenta, and peripheral blood of a pregnant woman) was 
      calculated using epidemiological and statistical parameters. Thick blood smear
      (TBS) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used as
      diagnostic tests. Results and Conclusions. A total of 137 parturient women were
      studied. All cases of CPI were submicroscopic (TBS negative and qPCR positive)
      and asymptomatic infections. If the definition of CPI considers only detection of
      parasites in umbilical cord blood, regardless of what was found in peripheral or 
      placental blood, the frequency of CPI was 27%. However, if that definition is
      stricter and includes simultaneous detection of parasites in maternal or
      placental blood with the same species, the frequency of CPI in this study was
      13%.

TI  - Increase in the prevalence of mutations associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from early to late
      pregnancy in Nanoro, Burkina Faso.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1831-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are a high-risk group for Plasmodium falciparum
      infections, which may result in maternal anaemia and low birth weight newborns,
      among other adverse birth outcomes. Intermittent preventive treatment with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) is widely implemented to
      prevent these negative effects of malaria. However, resistance against SP by P.
      falciparum may decrease efficacy of IPTp-SP. Combinations of point mutations in
      the dhps (codons A437, K540) and dhfr genes (codons N51, C59, S108) of P.
      falciparum are associated with SP resistance. In this study the prevalence of SP 
      resistance mutations was determined among P. falciparum found in pregnant women
      and the general population (GP) from Nanoro, Burkina Faso and the association of 
      IPTp-SP dosing and other variables with mutations was studied. METHODS: Blood
      spots on filter papers were collected from pregnant women at their first
      antenatal care visit (ANC booking) and at delivery, from an ongoing trial and
      from the GP in a cross-sectional survey. The dhps and dhfr genes were amplified
      by nested PCR and products were sequenced to identify mutations conferring
      resistance (ANC booking, n = 400; delivery, n = 223; GP, n = 400). Prevalence was
      estimated with generalized estimating equations and for multivariate analyses
      mixed effects logistic regression was used. RESULTS: The prevalence of the triple
      dhfr mutation was high, and significantly higher in the GP and at delivery than
      at ANC booking, but it did not affect birth weight. Furthermore, quintuple
      mutations (triple dhfr and double dhps mutations) were found for the first time
      in Burkina Faso. IPTp-SP did not significantly affect the occurrence of any of
      the mutations, but high transmission season was associated with increased
      mutation prevalence in delivery samples. It is unclear why the prevalence of
      mutations was higher in the GP than in pregnant women at ANC booking. CONCLUSION:
      The high number of mutants and the presence of quintuple mutants in Burkina Faso 
      confirm concerns about the efficacy of IPTp-SP in the near future. Other drug
      combinations to tackle malaria in pregnancy should, therefore, be explored. An
      increase in mutation prevalence due to IPTp-SP dosing could not be confirmed.

PG  - e0176004
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0176004 [doi]
AB  - Malaria, particularly due to Plasmodium falciparum, remains a major public health
      threat in Ethiopia. Artemether-lumefantine (AL) has been the first-line
      antimalarial drug against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the country
      since 2004. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drugs is recommended by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO) to help early detection of drug resistant strains of
      the parasite and contain their rapid spread. The objective of this study was to
      assess the therapeutic efficacy of AL in a high-transmission setting in Ethiopia.
      The study site was Setit Humera, northwest Ethiopia. Single-arm prospective study
      of a 28-day follow-up was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015 according
      to the revised WHO 2009 drug efficacy study protocol. Study end-points were
      classified into primary end-point and secondary end-point. While the primary
      end-point was the day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response the
      secondary end-points were clinical and parasitological evaluations (parasite,
      fever and gametocyte clearance rate, incidence of drug adverse events) and the
      relative increment in hemoglobin (Hb) level from baseline to day (D) 14 and D28. 
      A total of 92 patients were enrolled and 79 had completed the 28-day follow-up
      period. The overall cure rate was 98.8% with 95% confidence interval of
      0.915-0.998 without polymerase chain reaction correction. The parasite clearance 
      rate was high with fast resolution of clinical symptoms; 100% of the study
      participants cleared parasitaemia and fever on D3. Gametocyte carriage was
      reduced from 7% on D0 to 1% on D3 and complete clearance was achieved on D14.
      Mean Hb concentration significantly increased on D28 compared to that on D14.
      There was no serious adverse event. AL was efficacious and safe in a
      high-transmission setting for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new technique for diagnosis of Plasmodium knowlesi and at
      the same time to be able to discriminate among the diverse species of Plasmodium 
      causing human malaria. METHODS: In this study the nested multiplex malaria PCR
      was redesigned, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, to identify the fifth human
      Plasmodium species, Plasmodium knowlesi, together with the other human Plasmodium
      (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium
      malariae) by amplified fragment size using only two amplification processes and
      including an internal reaction control to avoid false negatives. RESULTS: The
      technique was validated with 91 clinical samples obtained from patients with
      malaria compatible symptoms. The technique showed high sensitivity (100%) and
      specificity (96%) when it was compared to the reference method employed for
      malaria diagnosis in the Instituto de Salud Carlos and a published real-time PCR 
      malaria assay. CONCLUSIONS: The technique designed is an economical, sensitive
      and specific alternative to current diagnosis methods. Furthermore, the method
      might be tested in knowlesi-malaria endemic areas with a higher number of samples
      to confirm the quality of the method.

TI  - Molecular identification of Plasmodium spp. and blood meal sources of anophelines
      in environmental reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of Maranhao, Brazil.
PG  - 203

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the diversity of feeding habits that females of some
      species of anophelines present, it is important to understand which vertebrates
      are part of blood food sources and how important is the role of each in the
      ecoepidemiology of malaria. There are many vector species for Plasmodium spp. in 
      the State of Maranhao, Brazil. In Sao Luis Island, Anopheles aquasalis is the
      main vector for human malaria; this species is abundant in areas with primates
      that are positive for Plasmodium. Anopheles aquasalis has natural exophilic and
      zoophilic feeding behavior, but in cases of high density and absence of animals, 
      presents quite varied behavior, and feeds on human blood. In this context, the
      objective of the present study was to identify Plasmodium spp. and the blood meal
      sources of anophelines in two environmental reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of
      Maranhao, using molecular methods. METHODS: Between June and July 2013, female
      anophelines were collected in the Sitio Aguahy Private Reserve, in the
      municipality of Sao Jose de Ribamar, and in the Sitio Mangalho Reserve, located
      within the Maracana Environmental Protection Area, in the municipality of Sao
      Luis. CDC-type light traps, Shannon traps and protected human bait were used
      during three consecutive hours in peridomestic and wooded areas. Pools of
      anophelines were formed using mosquitoes of the same species that had been caught
      at the same site on the same date. A genus-specific amplification protocol based 
      on the 18S rRNA gene was used for qPCR and cPCR. RESULTS: A total of 416
      anophelines were collected, of the following species: An. aquasalis (399), An.
      mediopunctatus (3), An. shannoni (1), An. nuneztovari (sensu lato) (1), An.
      goeldii (1), An. evansae (2) and An. (Nyssorhynchus) sp. (9), comprising 54
      pools. Two pools were positive for Plasmodium (2/54) based on the 18S rRNA gene. 
      In the phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method, based on a 240 
      bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, it was found that the sequences of Plasmodium
      sp. amplified from pools of An. aquasalis (pool 2) and An. nuneztovari (s.l.)
      (pool 10) were phylogenetically related to a clade of P. falciparum isolates from
      India, and to a clade of Plasmodium sp. isolates from psittacines in Brazil,
      respectively. Cat, dog and human DNA were identified in the blood meals of the
      anophelines sampled. CONCLUSION: The species An. aquasalis was the most abundant 
      anopheline species in Sao Luis Island. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected, thus
      confirming the importance of this species as the main vector on Sao Luis Island, 
      Brazil. In addition, the presence of An. nuneztovari (s.l.) with DNA positive for
      Plasmodium spp. confirms its importance as a secondary vector.

TI  - Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections in a
      highland district in Ghana, and the influence of HIV and sickle cell disease.
PG  - 167
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1823-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past two decades, there has been a reported decline in malaria
      in Ghana and the rest of the world; yet it remains the number one cause of
      mortality and morbidity. Human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and sickle cell
      disease (SCD) share a common geographical space with malaria in sub-Saharan
      Africa and an interaction between these three conditions has been suggested. This
      study determined the Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum status of
      symptomatic and non-symptomatic residents of Mpraeso in the highlands of
      Kwahu-South district of Ghana based on evidence of current national decline. The 
      influence of HIV and SCD on malaria was also determined. METHODS: Participants
      were 354 symptomatic patients visiting the Kwahu Government Hospital and 360
      asymptomatic residents of the district capital. This cross-sectional study was
      conducted during the minor rainy season (October-December 2014). Rapid diagnostic
      tests (RDT), blood film microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction
      assessment of blood were done. Participants who tested positive with RDT were
      treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy; and assessment of venous
      blood was repeated 7 days after treatment. HIV screening and haemoglobin
      genotyping was done. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to 
      determine the influence of SCD and HIV. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum was
      prevalent at 124/142 (87.3%). Plasmodium malariae was the only non-falciparum
      species detected at 18/142 (12.7%). HIV and SCD did not significantly increase
      odds of malaria infection. However, the use of ITN and recent anti-malarial
      intake significantly decreased the odds of being malaria infected by 0.45-fold
      and 0.46-fold respectively. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae
      infection are the prevailing species in the study area; albeit varying from the
      national average. HIV and SCD were not associated with the risk of having
      malaria.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Falciparum Malaria Infections in Zanzibar: Implications
      for Focal Drug Administration Strategies Targeting Asymptomatic Parasite
      Carriers.
PG  - 1236-1243
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix136 [doi]
AB  - Background: Optimal use of mass/targeted screen-and-treat or mass or focal drug
      administration as malaria elimination strategies remains unclear. We therefore
      studied spatial distribution of Plasmodium falciparum infections to compare
      simulated effects of these strategies on reducing the parasite reservoir in a
      pre-elimination setting. Methods: P. falciparum rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and
      molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and serological (enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay) analyses were performed on finger-prick blood samples from a
      population-based survey in 3 adjacent communities. Results: Among 5278 persons
      screened, 13 (0.2%) were positive by RDT and 123 (2.3%) by PCR. PCR-positive
      individuals were scattered over the study area, but logistic regression analysis 
      suggested a propensity of these infections to cluster around RDT-positive
      individuals. The odds ratios for being PCR positive was 7.4 (95% confidence
      interval, 2.8-19.9) for those living in the household of an RDT-positive
      individual and 1.64 (1.0-2.8; P = .06) for those living within <300 m, compared
      with >1000 m. Treating everyone within households of RDT-positive individuals (1%
      population) would target 13% of those who are PCR positive. Treating all living
      within a radius of <300 or <1000 m (14% or 58% population) would target 30% or
      66% of infections, respectively. Among 4431 serologically screened individuals,
      26% were seropositive. Treating everyone within seropositive households (63%
      population) would target 77% of PCR-positive individuals. Conclusions:
      Presumptive malaria treatment seemed justified within RDT-positive households and
      potentially worth considering within, for example, a radius of <300 m. Serology
      was not discriminative enough in identifying ongoing infections for improving
      focal interventions in this setting but may rather be useful to detect larger
      transmission foci.

      China-Myanmar border area.
PG  - 159
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1813-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sensitive methods for detecting asymptomatic malaria infections are
      essential for identifying potential transmission reservoirs and obtaining an
      accurate assessment of malaria epidemiology in low-endemicity areas aiming to
      eliminate malaria. PCR techniques to detect parasite nucleic acids (DNA or RNA)
      are among the most commonly used molecular methods. However, most of these
      methods are of low throughput and cannot be used for large-scale molecular
      epidemiological studies. A recently developed capture and ligation probe-PCR
      (CLIP-PCR) is claimed to have the sensitivity of molecular techniques and the
      high throughput capacity needed for screening purposes. This study aimed to
      compare several molecular methods for detecting asymptomatic and submicroscopic
      Plasmodium infections in healthy residents of a malaria-hypoendemic region in
      Southeast Asia, where malaria elimination is in sight. METHOD: This study
      compared three molecular detection methods side-by-side, namely nested PCR
      targeting the rRNA genes, nested RT-PCR to detect parasite rRNA, and CLIP-PCR to 
      detect parasite rRNA in 1005 healthy individuals in northeastern Myanmar. For
      nested PCR and RT-PCR, parasite DNA and total RNA were extracted from ~100 microL
      of blood, whereas RNA used for CLIP-PCR was from a 3 mm disk of dried blood
      filter paper. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods were compared with
      those of conventional light microscopy. In addition, RT-PCR and quantitative
      RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting the Pvs25 gene in Plasmodium vivax were used to assess
      gametocyte prevalence in the samples. RESULTS: Light microscopy detected
      Plasmodium infections in only 1.19% of the residents harbouring the parasites.
      CLIP-PCR had slightly better performance and detected Plasmodium infections in
      1.89% of the population. Further improvement was achieved by nested PCR to detect
      parasite DNA, which detected P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections in
      2.39% of the residents. The nested RT-PCR targeting rRNA, however, detected as
      many as 187 (18.61%) individuals having Plasmodium infections with P. vivax being
      the predominant species (176 P. vivax, 5 P. falciparum and 6 P. falciparum/P.
      vivax mixed infections). Of the 210 Plasmodium-positive samples detected by all
      molecular methods, 115 were Pvs25-positive by qRT-PCR, indicating that a large
      proportion of asymptomatic individuals were gametocyte carriers. CONCLUSION:
      Nested RT-PCR based on the detection of asexual-stage parasite rRNA was the most 
      sensitive, with a more than sixfold higher sensitivity than the other two
      molecular methods of parasite detection. CLIP-PCR has an increased throughput,
      but its sensitivity in this study was much lower than those of other molecular
      methods, which may be partially due to the smaller amount of RNA input used.

      control measures, have reduced the burden of falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan
      countries, including Sudan. Sudan adopted ACT in 2004 with a remarkable reduction
      in mortality due to falciparum malaria. However, emergence of resistance to the
      first-line treatment artesunate and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS/SP) has created
      new challenges to the control of malaria in Sudan. A search for an alternative
      drug of choice for treating uncomplicated malaria has become inevitable. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) and AS/SP in an area of unstable
      transmission in Blue Nile State, Sudan in 2015-16. METHODS: A total of 148
      patients with uncomplicated malaria were recruited in the study from November
      2015 to end of January 2016. Seventy-five patients received DHA-PPQ while 73
      received AS/SP. Patients were monitored for clinical and parasitological outcomes
      following the standard WHO protocol for a period of 42 days for DHA-PPQ and 28
      days for AS/SP; nested PCR (nPCR) was performed to confirm parasite re-appearance
      from day 7 onwards. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients completed the DHA-PPQ arm
      protocol with success cure rate of 98.2% (95% CI 90.3-100%) and one late clinical
      failure 1.8% (95% CI 0.0-9.7%). The AS/SP showed adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR) of 83.6% (95% CI 71.9-91.8%), early treatment
      failure was 1.6% (95% CI 0.0-8.8%) and late parasitological failure (LPF) was
      14.8% (95% CI 7-26.2%). The respective PCR uncorrected LPF was 20%. CONCLUSION:
      DHA-PPQ is an efficacious ACT and candidate for replacement of first-line
      treatment in Sudan while AS/SP showed high treatment failure rate and must be
      replaced.

AB  - Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a partial PCR based on
      water-oil emulsion droplet technology. It is a highly sensitive method for
      detecting and delineating minor alleles from complex backgrounds and provides
      absolute quantification of DNA targets. The ddPCR technology has been applied for
      detection of many pathogens. Here the sensitive assay utilizing ddPCR for
      detection and quantification of Plasmodium species was investigated. The assay
      was developed for two levels of detection, genus specific for all Plasmodium
      species and for specific Plasmodium species detection. The ddPCR assay was
      developed based on primers and probes specific to the Plasmodium genus 18S rRNA
      gene. Using ddPCR for ultra-sensitive P. falciparum assessment, the lower level
      of detection from concentrated DNA obtained from a high volume (1 mL) blood
      sample was 11 parasites/mL. For species identification, in particular for samples
      with mixed infections, a duplex reaction was developed for detection and
      quantification P. falciparum/ P. vivax and P. malariae/ P. ovale. Amplification
      of each Plasmodium species in the duplex reaction showed equal sensitivity to
      singleplex single species detection. The duplex ddPCR assay had higher
      sensitivity to identify minor species in 32 subpatent parasitaemia samples from
      Cambodia, and performed better than real-time PCR. The ddPCR assay shows high
      sensitivity to assess very low parasitaemia of all human Plasmodium species. This
      provides a useful research tool for studying the role of the asymptomatic
      parasite reservoir for transmission in regions aiming for malaria elimination.

TI  - High resolution melting: a useful field-deployable method to measure dhfr and
      dhps drug resistance in both highly and lowly endemic Plasmodium populations.
PG  - 153

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence and spread of drug resistance to every anti-malarial used
      to date, creates an urgent need for development of sensitive, specific and
      field-deployable molecular tools for detection and surveillance of validated drug
      resistance markers. Such tools would allow early detection of mutations in
      resistance loci. The aim of this study was to compare common population
      signatures and drug resistance marker frequencies between two populations with
      different levels of malaria endemicity and history of anti-malarial drug use:
      Tanzania and Senegal. This was accomplished by implementing a high resolution
      melting assay to study molecular markers of drug resistance as compared to
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP)
      methodology. METHODS: Fifty blood samples were collected each from a lowly
      malaria endemic site (Senegal), and a highly malaria endemic site (Tanzania) from
      patients presenting with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria at clinic.
      Data representing the DHFR were derived using both PCR-RFLP and HRM assay; while 
      genotyping data representing the DHPS were evaluated in Senegal and Tanzania
      using HRM. Msp genotyping analysis was used to characterize the multiplicity of
      infection in both countries. RESULTS: A high prevalence of samples harbouring
      mutant DHFR alleles was observed in both population using both genotyping
      techniques. HRM was better able to detect mixed alleles compared to PCR/RFLP for 
      DHFR codon 51 in Tanzania; and only HRM was able to detect mixed infections from 
      Senegal. A high prevalence of mutant alleles in DHFR (codons 51, 59, 108) and
      DHPS (codon 437) were found among samples from Senegal while no mutations were
      observed at DHPS codons 540 and 581, from both countries. Overall, the frequency 
      of samples harbouring either a single DHFR mutation (S108N) or double mutation in
      DHFR (C59R/S108N) was greater in Senegal compared to Tanzania. CONCLUSION: Here
      the results demonstrate that HRM is a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable
      alternative technique to PCR-RFLP genotyping that is useful in populations
      harbouring more than one parasite genome (polygenomic infections). In this study,
      a high levels of resistance polymorphisms was observed in both dhfr and dhps,
      among samples from Tanzania and Senegal. A routine monitoring by molecular
      markers can be a way to detect emergence of resistance involving a change in the 
      treatment policy.

TI  - Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in the Republic
      of Congo: four and nine years after the introduction of artemisinin-based
      combination therapy.
PG  - 155

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to anti-malarial drugs hinders efforts on malaria
      elimination and eradication. Following the global spread of chloroquine-resistant
      parasites, the Republic of Congo adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT) in 2006 as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. To assess the 
      impacts after implementation of ACT, a molecular surveillance for anti-malarial
      drug resistance was conducted in Congo 4 and 9 years after the introduction of
      ACT. METHODS: Blood samples of 431 febrile children aged 1-10 years were utilized
      from two previous studies conducted in 2010 (N = 311) and 2015 (N = 120). All
      samples were screened for malaria parasites using nested PCR. Direct sequencing
      was used to determine the frequency distribution of genetic variants in the
      anti-malarial drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum genes (Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfatp6, 
      Pfk13) in malaria-positive isolates. RESULTS: One-hundred and nineteen (N = 70
      from 2010 and N = 49 from 2015) samples were positive for P. falciparum. A
      relative decrease in the proportion of chloroquine-resistant haplotype (CVIET)
      from 100% in 2005, 1 year before the introduction and implementation of ACT in
      2006, to 98% in 2010 to 71% in 2015 was observed. Regarding the multidrug
      transporter gene, a considerable reduction in the frequency of the mutations N86Y
      (from 73 to 27%) and D1246Y (from 22 to 0%) was observed. However, the prevalence
      of the Y184F mutation remained stable (49% in 2010 compared to 54% in 2015).
      Isolates carrying the Pfatp6 H243Y was 25% in 2010 and this frequency was reduced
      to null in 2015. None of the parasites harboured the Pfk13 mutations associated
      with prolonged artemisinin clearance in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, 13 new
      Pfk13 variants are reported among the investigated isolates. CONCLUSION: The
      implementation of ACT has led to the decline in prevalence of
      chloroquine-resistant parasites in the Republic of Congo. However, the constant
      prevalence of the PfMDR1 Y184F mutation, associated with lumefantrine
      susceptibility, indicate a selective drug pressure still exists. Taken together, 
      this study could serve as the basis for epidemiological studies monitoring the
      distribution of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance in the Republic of
      Congo.

TI  - Assessment of copy number variation in genes related to drug resistance in
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Brazilian Amazon and
      a systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 152
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1806-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parasite resistance to anti-malarials represents a great obstacle for
      malaria elimination. The majority of studies have investigated the association
      between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and drug resistance; however, it
      is becoming clear that the copy number variation (CNV) is also associated with
      this parasite phenotype. To provide a baseline for molecular surveillance of
      anti-malarial drug resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, the present study
      characterized the genetic profile of both markers in the most common genes
      associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      isolates. Additionally, these data were compared to data published elsewhere
      applying a systematic review of the literature published over a 20-year time
      period. METHODS: The genomic DNA of 67 patients infected by P. falciparum and P. 
      vivax from three Brazilian States was obtained between 2002 and 2012. CNV in P.
      falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1 (pfmdr1), GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1)
      and P. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) were assessed by real-time PCR 
      assays. SNPs in the pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes were assessed by PCR-RFLP. A
      literature search for studies that analysed CNP in the same genes of P.
      falciparum and P. vivax was conducted between May 2014 and March 2017 across four
      databases. RESULTS: All analysed samples of P. falciparum carried only one copy
      of pfmdr1 or pfgch1. Although the pfcrt K76T polymorphism, a determinant of CQ
      resistance, was present in all samples genotyped, the pfmdr1 N86Y was absent. For
      P. vivax isolates, an amplification rate of 20% was found for the pvmdr1 gene.
      The results of the study are in agreement with the low amplification rates for
      pfmdr1 gene evidenced in the Americas and Africa, while higher rates have been
      described in Southeast Asia. For P. vivax, very low rates of amplification for
      pvmdr1 have been described worldwide, with exceptions in French Guiana, Cambodia,
      Thailand and Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: The present study was the first to evaluate
      gch1 CNV in P. falciparum isolates from Brazil, showing an absence of
      amplification of this gene more than 20 years after the withdrawal of the
      Brazilian antifolates therapeutic scheme. Furthermore, the rate of pvmdr1
      amplification was significantly higher than that previously reported for isolates
      circulating in Northern Brazil.

TI  - Risk of daytime transmission of malaria in the French Guiana rain forest.
PG  - 111-112
LID - 10.1684/mst.2017.0659 [doi]
AB  - Between 2008 and 2014, there were 1070 malaria cases reported in French Guiana
      among members of the armed forces. Most of the malaria outbreaks investigated
      were multifactorial and followed missions conducted at illegal gold mining sites.
      For example, a malaria outbreak occurred in September 2013, three weeks after the
      deployment of 15 soldiers at Dagobert, which is such a site. The attack rate was 
      53%, with seven Plasmodium vivax infections and one coinfection with both
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. Two months later, an entomological
      investigation in the field caught 321 anopheles by the human landing catch
      method. Among them, 282 were Anopheles darlingi. One specimen was PCR-positive
      for P. vivax, for an infection rate of 0.4% (1/282). In 15.7% of these cases, the
      An. darlingi was caught during the day. The existence of daytime biting activity 
      by An. darlingi in the Guianese forest might play a key role in malaria outbreaks
      among military personnel. This finding requires that the Army Health Service
      adapt its recommendations concerning malaria prevention in French Guiana.

TI  - Impact of metric and sample size on determining malaria hotspot boundaries.
PG  - 45849
LID - 10.1038/srep45849 [doi]
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of malaria suggests that interventions may be targeted 
      for maximum impact. It is unclear to what extent different metrics lead to
      consistent delineation of hotspot boundaries. Using data from a large
      community-based malaria survey in the western Kenyan highlands, we assessed the
      agreement between a model-based geostatistical (MBG) approach to detect hotspots 
      using Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence and serological evidence for
      exposure. Malaria transmission was widespread and highly heterogeneous with one
      third of the total population living in hotspots regardless of metric tested.
      Moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.424) was observed between hotspots defined based on
      parasite prevalence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and the prevalence of
      antibodies to two P. falciparum antigens (MSP-1, AMA-1). While numerous
      biologically plausible hotspots were identified, their detection strongly relied 
      on the proportion of the population sampled. When only 3% of the population was
      sampled, no PCR derived hotspots were reliably detected and at least 21% of the
      population was needed for reliable results. Similar results were observed for
      hotspots of seroprevalence. Hotspot boundaries are driven by the malaria
      diagnostic and sample size used to inform the model. These findings warn against 
      the simplistic use of spatial analysis on available data to target malaria
      interventions in areas where hotspot boundaries are uncertain.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and artemisinin resistance in northern Myanmar: evidence
      from in vivo and molecular marker studies.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1775-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Myanmar, three types of artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT) are recommended as first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria: artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-mefloquine (AS + MQ), and
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Resistance to both artemisinins and ACT
      partner drugs has been reported from the Greater Mekong Sub-region, and regular
      efficacy monitoring of the recommended ACT is conducted in Myanmar. This paper
      reports on results from studies to monitor the efficacy of the three forms of ACT
      in sentinel sites in northern Myanmar, and investigations of mutations in the
      Kelch13 (k13) propeller domain. METHODS: Seven therapeutic efficacy studies were 
      conducted in 2011-12 and 2014 in three sentinel sites in Myanmar (Tamu, Muse,
      Tabeikkyin). Three studies were done for the evaluation of AL (204 patients), two
      studies for AS + MQ (119 patients) and two studies for DP (147 patients). These
      studies were done according to 2009 standard WHO protocol. Polymorphisms in the
      k13 propeller domain were examined in dried blood spots collected on day 0. The
      primary endpoint was adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day
      28 for AL and on day 42 for DP and AS + MQ, corrected to exclude re-infection
      using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Safety data were collected
      through self-reporting. RESULTS: PCR-corrected ACPR was 97.2-100% for AL,
      98.6-100% for AS + MQ and 100% for DP across the study sites and years. All
      studies found a prevalence of k13 mutations (>440) above 23% in the day-0
      samples. The F446I mutation was the most common mutation, making up 66.0% of the 
      mutations found. Seven out of nine day-3 positive patients were infected with k13
      wild type parasites. The remaining two cases with day-3 parasitaemia had the
      P574L mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of AL, AS + MQ and DP remains high in
      northern Myanmar despite widespread evidence of k13 mutations associated with
      delayed parasite clearance. This study showed that already in 2012 there was a
      high frequency of k13 mutations in Myanmar on the border with India. The high
      efficacy of the recommended ACT gives confidence in the continued recommendation 
      of the use of these treatments in Myanmar. Trial registration numbers

TI  - Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with drug resistance
      in Hodh Elgharbi, a malaria hotspot near Malian-Mauritanian border.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A malaria hotspot in the southeastern region of Mauritania, near the 
      Malian border, may hamper malaria control strategies. The objectives were to
      estimate the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance 
      in Plasmodium falciparum isolates and establish baseline data. METHODS: The study
      was conducted in two malaria-endemic areas in Hodh Elgharbi, situated in the
      Malian-Mauritanian border area. Blood samples were collected from symptomatic
      patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, and Pfdhps
      were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA sequencing
      and primer extension. The Pfmdr1 gene copy number was determined by real-time
      PCR. RESULTS: Of 280 P. falciparum-infected patients, 193 (68.9%) carried the
      Pfcrt 76T mutant allele. The Pfmdr1 86Y and 184F mutations were found in 61
      (23.1%) of 264 isolates and 167 (67.6%) of 247 samples that were successfully
      genotyped, respectively. Pfmdr1 mutant alleles 1034C, 1042D and 1246Y were rarely
      observed. Of 102 P. falciparum isolates analysed, ten (9.8%) had more than one
      copy of Pfmdr1 gene. The prevalence of isolates harbouring at least triple mutant
      Pfdhfr 51I, 59R, 108 N/T was 42% (112/268), of which 42 (37.5%) had an additional
      Pfdhps 437G mutation. The Pfdhps 540E mutation was observed in four isolates
      (1.5%), including three associated with Pfdhfr triple mutant. Only two quintuple 
      mutants (Pfdhfr-51I-59R-108N Pfdhps-437G-540E) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      observed mutations in Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, and Pfcrt may jeopardize the future
      of seasonal malaria chemoprevention based on
      amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, intermittent preventive treatment for
      pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and treatment with
      artesunate-amodiaquine. Complementary studies should be carried out to document
      the distribution, origin and circulation of P. falciparum populations in this
      region and more widely in the country to assess the risk of the spread of
      resistance.

TI  - Asymptomatic and sub-microscopic malaria infection in Kayah State, eastern
      Myanmar.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1789-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myanmar has the heaviest burden of malaria in the Greater Mekong
      Sub-region. Asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infections are common in this region and
      may represent an important reservoir of transmission that must be targeted for
      malaria elimination. METHODS: A mass blood survey was conducted among 485
      individuals from six villages in Kayah State, an area of endemic but low
      transmission malaria in eastern Myanmar. Malaria infection was screened by rapid 
      diagnostic test (RDT), light microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR), and its association with demographic factors was explored. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infection was 2.3% (11/485) by
      real-time PCR. Plasmodium vivax accounted for 72.7% (8/11) and Plasmodium
      falciparum for 27.3% (3/11) of infections. Men were at greater risk of infection 
      by Plasmodium spp. than women. Individuals who worked as farmers or wood and
      bamboo cutters had an increased risk of infection. CONCLUSION: A combination of
      RDT, light microscopy and PCR diagnostics were used to identify asymptomatic
      malaria infection, providing additional information on asymptomatic cases in
      addition to the routine statistics on symptomatic cases, so as to determine the
      true burden of disease in the area. Such information and risk factors can improve
      malaria risk stratification and guide decision-makers towards better design and
      delivery of targeted interventions in small villages, representative of Kayah
      State.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance genes,
      pfcrt and pfmdr1, in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/s13104-017-2468-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria still poses one of the major threats to human health.
      Development of effective antimalarial drugs has decreased this threat; however,
      the emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, a cause of Malaria, is
      disconcerting. The antimalarial drug chloroquine has been effectively used, but
      resistant parasites have spread worldwide. Interestingly, the withdrawal of the
      drug reportedly leads to an increased population of susceptible parasites in some
      cases. We examined the prevalence of genomic polymorphisms in a malaria parasite 
      P. falciparum, associated with resistance to an antimalarial drug chloroquine,
      after the withdrawal of the drug from Indonesia. RESULTS: Blood samples were
      collected from 95 malaria patients in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 2010.
      Parasite DNA was extracted and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for pfcrt and pfmdr1. In parallel,
      multiplex amplicon sequencing for the same genes was carried out with Illumina
      MiSeq. Of the 59 cases diagnosed as P. falciparum infection by microscopy,
      PCR-RFLP analysis clearly identified the genotype 76T in pfcrt in 44 cases.
      Sequencing analysis validated the identified genotypes in the 44 cases and
      demonstrated that the haplotype in the surrounding genomic region was exclusively
      SVMNT. Results of pfmdr1 were successfully obtained for 51 samples, where the
      genotyping results obtained by the two methods were completely consistent. In
      pfmdr1, the 86Y mutant genotype was observed in 45 cases (88.2%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Our results suggest that the prevalence of the mutated genotypes remained
      dominant even 6 years after the withdrawal of chloroquine from this region.
      Diversified haplotype of the resistance-related locus, potentially involved in
      fitness costs, unauthorized usage of chloroquine, and/or a short post-withdrawal 
      period may account for the observed high persistence of prevalence.

AB  - The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs continues to
      challenge malaria control. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the first-line treatment of uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria, in children under five years of age in Mozambique. We
      conducted a prospective one-arm study to evaluate the clinical and
      parasitological efficacy of AL over 28days at four sentinel sites, using the WHO 
      protocol for assessing the efficacy of antimalarial treatment. msp1, msp2 and
      glurp genes were analysed by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate
      recrudescence from re-infection with malaria parasites. Haemoglobin concentration
      was recorded at baseline and on days 7, 14 and 28. A total of 349 children with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited at the four sentinel sites.
      Adequate clinical and parasitological response to AL on day 28 follow-up varied
      from 96.3% to 100% after correction by PCR. The drug was well tolerated, and no
      adverse event related to the drug was reported. AL, the current first-line
      treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mozambique, remains highly
      efficacious at the study sites. Monitoring of the efficacy of the recommended
      antimalarial drugs should be continued in order to detect any emerging threat to 
      their efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12616001680459.

TI  - Limitations of Rapid Diagnostic Testing in Patients with Suspected Malaria: A
      Diagnostic Accuracy Evaluation from Swaziland, a Low-Endemicity Country Aiming
      for Malaria Elimination.
PG  - 1221-1227
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix131 [doi]
AB  - Background: The performance of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich
      protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to evaluate suspected malaria in
      low-endemicity settings has not been well characterized. Methods: Using dried
      blood spot samples from patients with suspected malaria at 37 health facilities
      from 2012 to 2014 in the low-endemicity country of Swaziland, we investigated the
      diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein 2-based RDTs using qualitative
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (nested PCR targeting the cytochrome b gene) and 
      quantitative PCR as reference standards. To explore reasons for false-negative
      and/or false-positive results, we used pfhrp2/3-specific PCR and logistic
      regression analyses of potentially associated epidemiological factors. Results:
      From 1353 patients, 93.0% of RDT-positive (n = 185) and 31.2% of RDT-negative
      samples (n = 340) were available and selected for testing. Compared with nested
      PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
      predictive value (NPV) of RDTs were 51.7%, 94.1%, 67.3%, and 89.1%, respectively.
      After exclusion of samples with parasite densities <100/muL, which accounted for 
      75.7% of false-negative results and 33.3% of PCR-detectable infections, the
      sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 78.8%, 93.7%, 62.3%, and 97.1%.
      Deletions of pfhrp2 were not detected. False-positivity was more likely during
      the second year and was not associated with demographics, recent malaria, health 
      facility testing characteristics, or potential DNA degradation. Conclusions: In
      the low-transmission setting of Swaziland, we demonstrated low sensitivity of RDT
      for malaria diagnosis, owing to an unexpectedly high proportion of low-density
      infection among symptomatic subjects. The PPV was also low, requiring further
      investigation. A more accurate point-of-care diagnostic may be needed to support 
      malaria elimination efforts.

TI  - Treatment of Chronic Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Infection Does Not
      Increase the Risk of Clinical Malaria Upon Reinfection.
PG  - 645-653
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciw849 [doi]
AB  - Background: Chronic asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in
      endemic areas and are thought to contribute to the maintenance of malaria
      immunity. Whether treatment of these infections increases the subsequent risk of 
      clinical episodes of malaria is unclear. Methods: In a 3-year study in Mali,
      asymptomatic individuals with or without P. falciparum infection at the end of
      the 6-month dry season were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
      clinical malaria risk was compared during the ensuing 6-month malaria
      transmission season. At the end of the second dry season, 3 groups of
      asymptomatic children were identified: (1) children infected with P. falciparum
      as detected by rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) who were treated with antimalarials
      (n = 104), (2) RDT-negative children whose untreated P. falciparum infections
      were detected retrospectively by PCR (n = 55), and (3) uninfected children
      (RDT/PCR negative) (n = 434). Clinical malaria risk during 2 subsequent malaria
      seasons was compared. Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibody kinetics during the
      dry season were compared in children who did or did not harbor asymptomatic P.
      falciparum infections. Results: Chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infection
      predicted decreased clinical malaria risk during the subsequent malaria
      season(s); treatment of these infections did not alter this reduced risk.
      Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibodies declined similarly in children who did 
      or did not harbor chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infection during the dry
      season. Conclusions: These findings challenge the notion that chronic
      asymptomatic P. falciparum infection maintains malaria immunity and suggest that 
      mass drug administration during the dry season should not increase the subsequent
      risk of clinical malaria.

TI  - Clinical, virological, and biological parameters associated with outcomes of
      Ebola virus infection in Macenta, Guinea.
PG  - e88864
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.88864 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is poorly
      characterized. The establishment of well-equipped diagnostic laboratories close
      to Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) has made it possible to obtain relevant
      virological and biological data during the course of EVD and to assess their
      association with the clinical course and different outcomes of the disease.
      METHODS. We were responsible for diagnosing EBOV infection in patients admitted
      to two ETCs in forested areas of Guinea. The pattern of clinical signs was
      recorded, and an etiological diagnosis was established by RT-PCR for EBOV
      infection or a rapid test for malaria and typhoid fever. Biochemical analyses
      were also performed. RESULTS. We handled samples from 168 patients between
      November 29, 2014, and January 31, 2015; 97 patients were found to be infected
      with EBOV, with Plasmodium falciparum coinfection in 18%. Overall mortality for
      EVD cases was 58%, rising to 86% if P. falciparum was also present. Viral load
      was higher in fatal cases of EVD than in survivors, and fatal cases were
      associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 levels. Furthermore,
      regardless of outcome, EVD was characterized by higher creatine kinase (CPK),
      amylase, and creatinine levels than in febrile patients without EVD, with higher 
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in fatal cases of EVD only. CONCLUSION. These
      findings suggest that a high viral load at admission is a marker of poor EVD
      prognosis. In addition, high AST, ALT, CRP, and IL-6 levels are associated with a
      fatal outcome of EVD. Damage to the liver and other tissues, with massive
      rhabdomyolysis and, probably, acute pancreatitis, is associated with EVD and
      correlated with disease severity. Finally, biochemical analyses provide
      substantial added value at ETCs, making it possible to improve supportive
      rehydration and symptomatic care for patients. FUNDING. The French Ministry of
      Foreign Affairs, the Agence Francaise de Developpement, and Institut Pasteur.

TI  - Evaluation of SYBR green I based visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification
      (LAMP) assay for genus and species-specific diagnosis of malaria in P. vivax and 
      P. falciparum endemic regions.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an
      emerging nucleic acid based diag- nostic approach that is easily adaptable to the
      field settings with limited technical resources. This study was aimed to evaluate
      the LAMP assay for the detection and identification of Plasmodium falciparum and 
      P. vivax infection in malaria suspected cases using genus and species-specific
      assay. METHODS: The 18S rRNA-based LAMP assay was evaluated for diagnosis of
      genus Plasmodium, and species- specific diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 
      infection employing 317 malaria suspected cases, and the results were compared
      with those obtained by 18S nested PCR (n-PCR). All the samples were confirmed by 
      microscopy for the presence of Plasmodium parasite. RESULTS: The n-PCR was
      positive in all Plasmodium-infected cases (n=257; P. falciparum=133; P.
      vivax=124) and negative in microscopy negative cases (n=58) except for two cases 
      which were positive for P. vivax, giving a sen- sitivity of 100% (95% CI:
      97.04-100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 88.45-99.5%). Genus-specific LAMP 
      assay missed 11 (3.2%) microscopy and n-PCR confirmed vivax malaria cases.
      Considering PCR results as a refer- ence, LAMP was 100% sensitive and specific
      for P. falciparum, whereas it exhibited 95.16% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity 
      for P. vivax. The n-PCR assay detected 10 mixed infection cases while
      species-specific LAMP detected five mixed infection cases of P. vivax and P.
      falciparum, which were not detected by microscopy. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:
      Genus-specific LAMP assay displayed low sensitivity. Falciparum specific LAMP
      assay displayed high sensitivity whereas vivax specific LAMP assay displayed low 
      sensitivity. Failed detection of vivax cases otherwise confirmed by the n-PCR
      assay indicates exploitation of new targets and improved detection methods to
      attain 100% results for P. vivax detection.

TI  - Development, standardization and validation of molecular techniques for malaria
      vector species identification, trophic preferences, and detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum.
PG  - 25-34
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Knowledge on prevalence of malaria vector species of a
      certain area provides important information for implementation of appropriate
      control strategies. The present study describes a rapid method for screening of
      major Anopheline vector species and at the same time detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoite infection and blood meal preferences/trophic preferences.
      METHODS: The study was carried from February 2012 to March 2013 in three seasons,
      i.e. rainy, winter and summer in Jhumpura PHC of Keonjhar district, Odisha,
      India. Processing of mosquitoes was carried out in two different methods, viz.
      mosquito pool (P1) and mosquito DNA pool (P2). Pool size for both the methods was
      standardized for DNA isolation and multiplex PCR assay. This PCR based assay was 
      employed to screen the major vector com- position in three different seasons of
      four different ecotypes of Keonjhar district. Pearson's correlation coefficient
      was determined for a comparative analysis of the morphological identification
      with the pool prevalence assay for each ecotype. RESULTS: A pool size of 10 was
      standardized for DNA isolation as well as PCR. PCR assay revealed that the
      average pool prevalence for all ecotypes was highest for An. annularis in winter 
      and summer whereas for An. culicifacies it was rainy season. Foothill and plain
      ecotypes contributed to highest and lowest vectorial abundance respectively. The 
      results of the prevalence of vector species in pool from PCR based assay were
      found to be highly correlated with that of the results of morphological
      identification. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Screening by pool based PCR assay is
      relatively rapid as compared to conventional identification and can be employed
      as an important tool in malaria control programmes.

AB  - Proteases are crucial enzymes with varying roles in living organisms. In the
      malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the role of proteases has been deciphered
      mainly in the asexual blood stages and shown to represent promising drug targets.
      However, little is known about their functions in the sexual blood stages, which 
      are important for transmission of the disease from the human to the mosquito
      vector. Determination of their stage-specific expression during the malaria
      life-cycle is crucial for the effective design of multi-stage anti-malaria drugs 
      aimed at eradicating the disease. In this study, we screened the P. falciparum
      genome database for putative proteases and determined the transcript and protein 
      expression profiles of selected proteases in the plasmodial blood stages using
      semi-quantitative RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Database mining
      identified a total of 148 putative proteases, out of which 18 were demonstrated
      to be expressed in the blood stages on the transcript level; for 12 of these
      proteins synthesis was confirmed. While three of these proteases exhibit
      gametocyte-specific expression, two are restricted to the asexual blood stages
      and seven are found in both stages, making them interesting multi-stage drug
      targets.

AB  - Cytokinins are plant hormones that are involved in regulation of cell
      proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell and plastid development. Here, we
      show that the apicomplexan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei, an
      opportunistic human pathogen and a rodent malaria agent, respectively, produce
      cytokinins via a biosynthetic pathway similar to that in plants. Cytokinins
      regulate the growth and cell cycle progression of T. gondii by mediating
      expression of the cyclin gene TgCYC4. A natural form of cytokinin, trans-zeatin
      (t-zeatin), upregulated expression of this cyclin, while a synthetic cytokinin,
      thidiazuron, downregulated its expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy and
      quantitative PCR analysis showed that t-zeatin increased the genome-copy number
      of apicoplast, which are non-photosynthetic plastid, in the parasite, while
      thidiazuron led to their disappearance. Thidiazuron inhibited growth of T. gondii
      and Plasmodium falciparum, a human malaria parasite, suggesting that thidiazuron 
      has therapeutic potential as an inhibitor of apicomplexan parasites.

PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1780-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are today the most widely used method
      for malaria diagnosis and are recommended, alongside microscopy, for the
      confirmation of suspected cases before the administration of anti-malarial
      treatment. The diagnostic performance of RDTs, as compared to microscopy or PCR
      is well described but the actual analytical sensitivity of current best-in-class 
      tests is poorly documented. This value is however a key performance indicator and
      a benchmark value needed to developed new RDTs of improved sensitivity. METHODS: 
      Thirteen RDTs detecting either the Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2
      (HRP2) or the plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigens were selected from
      the best performing RDTs according to the WHO-FIND product testing programme. The
      analytical sensitivity of these products was evaluated using a range of reference
      materials including P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax whole parasite samples as 
      well as recombinant proteins. RESULTS: The best performing HRP2-based RDTs could 
      detect all P. falciparum cultured samples at concentrations as low as 0.8 ng/mL
      of HRP2. The limit of detection of the best performing pLDH-based RDT
      specifically detecting P. vivax was 25 ng/mL of pLDH. CONCLUSION: The analytical 
      sensitivity of P. vivax and Pan pLDH-based RDTs appears to vary considerably from
      product to product, and improvement of the limit-of-detection for P. vivax
      detecting RDTs is needed to match the performance of HRP2 and Pf pLDH-based RDTs 
      for P. falciparum. Different assays using different reference materials produce
      different values for antigen concentration in a given specimen, highlighting the 
      need to establish universal reference assays.

      Plasmodium falciparum During Early Childhood.
PG  - 1445-1451
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jix129 [doi]
AB  - Background: A mother's infection with placental malaria (PM) can affect her
      child's susceptibility to malaria, although the mechanism remains unclear. The
      fetus acquires a small amount of maternal cells and DNA known as maternal
      microchimerism (MMc), and we hypothesized that PM increases MMc and that MMc
      alters risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria during infancy. Methods: In a nested
      cohort from Muheza, Tanzania, we evaluated the presence and level of cord blood
      MMc in offspring of women with and without PM. A maternal-specific polymorphism
      was identified for each maternal-infant pair, and MMc was assayed by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction. The ability of MMc to predict malaria outcomes during 
      early childhood was evaluated in longitudinal models. Results: Inflammatory PM
      increased the detection rate of MMc among offspring of primigravidae and
      secundigravidae, and both noninflammatory and inflammatory PM increased the level
      of MMc. Detectable MMc predicted increased risk of positive blood smear but,
      interestingly, decreased risk of symptomatic malaria and malaria hospitalization.
      Conclusions: The acquisition of MMc may result in increased malaria infection but
      protection from malaria disease. Future studies should be directed at the
      cellular component of MMc, with attention to its ability to directly or
      indirectly coordinate anti-malarial immune responses in the offspring.

TI  - Diagnostic challenges and case management of the first imported case of
      Plasmodium knowlesi in Sri Lanka.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka has achieved 'malaria-free' status and is now in the phase 
      of prevention of re-introduction of malaria. Imported malaria remains a challenge
      to resurgence of the disease. The diagnostic challenges encountered and the rapid
      response initiated to manage a Plasmodium infection, which was later confirmed as
      Plasmodium knowlesi, the first reported case from Sri Lanka, is discussed. CASE
      PRESENTATION: An army officer who returned from Malaysia in October 2016 was
      found to be positive for Plasmodium both by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test 
      (RDT) by the Anti Malaria Campaign Sri Lanka (AMC) during his third visit to a
      health care provider. Microscopy findings were suspicious of P. knowlesi
      infection as the smears showed parasite stages similar to both Plasmodium
      malariae and Plasmodium falciparum. Nested PCR at AMC confirmed Plasmodium genus,
      but not the species. In the absence of species confirmation, the patient was
      treated as a case of P. falciparum. The presence of P. knowlesi was later
      confirmed by a semi-nested PCR assay performed at the Environmental Health
      Institute, National Environmental Agency in Singapore. The parasite strain was
      also characterized by sequencing the circumsporozoite gene. Extensive case
      investigation including parasitological and entomological surveillance was
      carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium knowlesi should be suspected in patients
      returning from countries in the South Asian region where the parasite is
      prevalent and when blood smear results are inconclusive.

AB  - In Africa, control programs that target primarily Plasmodium falciparum are
      inadequate for eliminating malaria. To learn more about prevalence and genetic
      variability of P. malariae in Africa, we examined blood samples from 663
      asymptomatic and 245 symptomatic persons from western Kenya during June-August of
      2014 and 2015. P. malariae accounted for 5.3% (35/663) of asymptomatic infections
      and 3.3% (8/245) of clinical cases. Among asymptomatic persons, 71% (32/45) of P.
      malariae infections detected by PCR were undetected by microscopy. The low
      sensitivity of microscopy probably results from the significantly lower
      parasitemia of P. malariae. Analyses of P. malariae circumsporozoite protein gene
      sequences revealed high genetic diversity among P. malariae in Africa, but no
      clear differentiation among geographic populations was observed. Our findings
      suggest that P. malariae should be included in the malaria elimination strategy
      in Africa and highlight the need for sensitive and field-applicable methods to
      identify P. malariae in malaria-endemic areas.

TI  - False-negative malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Rwanda: impact of Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates lacking hrp2 and declining malaria transmission.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1768-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) are
      often used to determine whether persons with fever should be treated with
      anti-malarials. However, Plasmodium falciparum parasites with a deletion of the
      hrp2 gene yield false-negative RDTs and there are concerns the sensitivity of
      HRP2-based RDTs may fall when the intensity of transmission decreases. METHODS:
      This observational study enrolled 9226 patients at three health centres in Rwanda
      from April 2014 to April 2015. It then compared the sensitivity of RDTs based on 
      HRP2 and the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) to microscopy (thick smears)
      for the diagnosis of malaria. PCR was used to determine whether deletions of the 
      histidine-rich central repeat region of the hrp2 gene (exon 2) were associated
      with false-negative HRP2-based RDTs. RESULTS: In comparison to microscopy, the
      sensitivity and specificity of HRP2- and pLDH-based RDTs were 89.5 and 86.2% and 
      80.2 and 94.3%, respectively. When the results for both RDTs were combined,
      sensitivity rose to 91.8% and specificity was 85.7%. Additionally, when smear
      positivity fell from 46 to 3%, the sensitivity of the HRP2-based RDT fell from 88
      to 67%. Of 370 samples with false-negative HRP2 RDT results for which PCR was
      performed, 140 (38%) were identified as P. falciparum by PCR. Of the isolates
      identified as P. falciparum by PCR, 32 (23%) were negative for the hrp2 gene
      based on PCR. Of the 32 P. falciparum isolates negative for hrp2 by PCR, 17 (53%)
      were positive based on the pLDH RDT. CONCLUSION: This prospective study of RDT
      performance coincided with a decline in the intensity of malaria transmission in 
      Kibirizi (fall in slide positivity from 46 to 3%). This decline was associated
      with a decrease in HRP2 RDT sensitivity (from 88 to 67%). While P. falciparum
      isolates without the hrp2 gene were an important cause of false-negative
      HRP2-based RDTs, most were identified by the pLDH-based RDT. Although WHO does
      not recommend the use of combined HRP2/pLDH testing in sub-Saharan Africa, these 
      results suggest that combination HRP2/pLDH-based RDTs could reduce the impact of 
      false-negative HRP2-based RDTs for detection of symptomatic P. falciparum
      malaria.

      polymerase chain reaction for optimum malaria diagnosis in Upper Myanmar.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1765-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium infection is crucial for prompt
      malaria treatment and surveillance. Microscopic examination has been widely
      applied as the gold standard for malaria diagnosis in most part of malaria
      endemic areas, but its diagnostic value has been questioned, particularly in
      submicroscopic malaria. In this study, the diagnostic performance of microscopic 
      examination and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated to establish
      optimal malaria diagnosis method in Myanmar. METHODS: A total of 1125 blood
      samples collected from residents in the villages and towns located in Naung Cho, 
      Pyin Oo Lwin, Tha Beik Kyin townships and Mandalay of Upper Myanmar were screened
      by microscopic examination and species-specific nested PCR method. RESULTS: Among
      the 1125 blood samples, 261 samples were confirmed to be infected with malaria by
      microscopic examination. Evaluation of the 1125 samples by species-specific
      nested PCR analysis revealed that the agreement between microscopic examination
      and nested PCR was 87.3% (261/299). Nested PCR successfully detected 38
      Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax infections, which were missed in
      microscopic examination. Microscopic examinations also either misdiagnosed the
      infected Plasmodium species, or did not detect mixed infections with different
      Plasmodium species in 31 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The nested PCR method is more
      reliable than conventional microscopic examination for the diagnosis of malaria
      infections, and this is particularly true in cases of mixed infections and
      submicroscopic infections. Given the observed higher sensitivity and specificity 
      of nested PCR, the molecular method holds enormous promise in malaria diagnosis
      and species differentiation, and can be applied as an effective monitoring tool
      for malaria surveillance, control and elimination in Myanmar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the effect on malaria prevalence, village specific monthly 
      administrations of pyrimethamine, chlorproguanil, chloroquine or placebo were
      given to children in four previously treatment-naive Liberian villages, 1976-78. 
      Plasmodium falciparum in vivo resistance developed to pyrimethamine only.
      Selection of molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance after 2 years of
      treatment are reported. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 191 study
      children in a survey in 1978. Polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps,
      pfmrp1 and pfnhe1 genes were determined using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Pfcrt
      72-76 CVIET was found in one chloroquine village sample, all remaining samples
      had pfcrt CVMNK. Pfmdr1 N86 prevalence was 100%. A pfmdr1 T1069ACT-->ACG
      synonymous polymorphism was found in 30% of chloroquine village samples and 3% of
      other samples (P = 0.008). Variations in pfnhe1 block I were found in all except 
      the chloroquine treated village (P < 0.001). Resistance associated pfdhfr 108N
      prevalence was 2% in the pyrimethamine village compared to 45-65% elsewhere,
      including the placebo village (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine treatment
      possibly resulted in the development of pfcrt 72-76 CVIET. Selection of pfmdr1
      T1069ACG and a pfnhe1 block 1 genotypes indicates that chloroquine treatment
      exerted a selective pressure on P. falciparum. Pyrimethamine resistance
      associated pfdhfr 108N was present prior to the introduction of any drug.
      Decreased pfdhfr 108N frequency concurrent with development of pyrimethamine
      resistance suggests a non-pfdhfr polymorphisms mediated resistance mechanism.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum GFP-E-NTPDase expression at the intraerythrocytic stages
      and its inhibition blocks the development of the human malaria parasite.
LID - 10.1007/s11302-017-9557-4 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most dangerous form of
      malaria in humans. It has been reported that the P. falciparum genome encodes for
      a single ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase), an enzyme
      that hydrolyzes extracellular tri- and di-phosphate nucleotides. The E-NTPDases
      are known for participating in invasion and as a virulence factor in many
      pathogenic protozoa. Despite its presence in the parasite genome, currently, no
      information exists about the activity of this predicted protein. Here, we show
      for the first time that P. falciparum E-NTPDase is relevant for parasite
      lifecycle as inhibition of this enzyme impairs the development of P. falciparum
      within red blood cells (RBCs). ATPase activity could be detected in rings,
      trophozoites, and schizonts, as well as qRT-PCR, confirming that E-NTPDase is
      expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle. In addition, transfection of a 
      construct which expresses approximately the first 500 bp of an E-NTPDase-GFP
      chimera shows that E-NTPDase co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in 
      the early stages and with the digestive vacuole (DV) in the late stages of P.
      falciparum intraerythrocytic cycle.

      circumsporozoite protein with 37 NANP and 4 NVDP epitopes].
PG  - 41-51
AB  - Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium, the leading cause of
      death amongst the parasitic diseases. The disease is transmitted to human by the 
      bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization 
      (WHO) data, there were an estimated 214 million malaria cases and estimated
      438.000 deaths occurred worldwide, in 2015. It is observed that 90% of all the
      deaths due to malaria occur in Africa. 78% of these cases were children who are
      under five years old. Intensive malaria interventions helped to reduce malaria
      incidence by 37% between 2000 and 2015. Malaria is a curable disease if diagnosed
      and treated promptly and correctly. Drug resistance has developed against almost 
      all anti-malarial drugs and an effective vaccine against malaria has not been
      developed yet. Vaccine studies initiated 40 years ago by sterile immunity against
      falciparum malaria through immunization by exposure to 1000 irradiated
      mosquitoes. Complex structures, complicated life cycles and various antigenic
      structures of Plasmodium species make vaccination studies difficult.
      Circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the most extensively studied protein is also
      present in the content of the vaccine candidate RTS,S which is currently closest 
      to get license. CSP was the first described Plasmodium antigen because of its
      important role during initiation of the parasitic infection. CSP is the major
      surface coat protein of Plasmodium parasite. CSP is a soluble protein and
      recombinant form of the CSP can be produced in Escherichia coli. NANP repeat
      region is a target site for host antibodies. Recently many DNA, RNA and protein
      vaccine candidates are being developed against malaria. According to WHO, in the 
      next 20 years period, malaria vaccine can be developed. In this study we aimed to
      produce recombinant CSP (rCSP). Initially, P.falciparum CSP gene was amplified by
      PCR. CSP gene was cloned in to the pJET cloning vector. The gene subcloned to the
      pET100 protein expression vector. E.coli cells were used for protein expression. 
      After this process, purification and endotoxin removal protocols were performed. 
      As a result, 1182 bp CSP gene was obtained from P.falciparum genomic DNA.
      Accuracy of cloning and DNA sequence of the CSP gene was determined with DNA
      sequence analysis. The gene sequence was recorded to the GenBank with a
      registration no KT315396. rCSP was expressed in E.coli cells. The existence of
      rCSP was verifiedwith Western Blot method and was purified and removed from
      endotoxins. rCSP aminoacid sequence and 3D shape was obtained.We believe that the
      production of recombinant CSP will enable us to contribute to the further malaria
      vaccine studies in our laboratory and country.

LID - 10.1128/JCM.00130-17 [doi]
AB  - Poor specificity may negatively impact rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-based
      diagnostic strategies for malaria. We performed real-time PCR on a subset of
      subjects who had undergone diagnostic testing with a multiple-antigen
      (histidine-rich protein 2 and pan-lactate dehydrogenase pLDH [HRP2/pLDH]) RDT and
      microscopy. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT in
      comparison to results of PCR for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 
      We developed and evaluated a two-step algorithm utilizing the multiple-antigen
      RDT to screen patients, followed by confirmatory microscopy for those individuals
      with HRP2-positive (HRP2+)/pLDH-negative (pLDH-) results. In total, dried blood
      spots (DBS) were collected from 276 individuals. There were 124 (44.9%)
      individuals with an HRP2+/pLDH+ result, 94 (34.1%) with an HRP2+/pLDH- result,
      and 58 (21%) with a negative RDT result. The sensitivity and specificity of the
      RDT compared to results with real-time PCR were 99.4% (95% confidence interval
      [CI], 95.9 to 100.0%) and 46.7% (95% CI, 37.7 to 55.9%), respectively. Of the 94 
      HRP2+/pLDH- results, only 32 (34.0%) and 35 (37.2%) were positive by microscopy
      and PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the two-step algorithm 
      compared to results with real-time PCR were 95.5% (95% CI, 90.5 to 98.0%) and
      91.0% (95% CI, 84.1 to 95.2), respectively. HRP2 antigen bands demonstrated poor 
      specificity for the diagnosis of malaria compared to that of real-time PCR in a
      high-transmission setting. The most likely explanation for this finding is the
      persistence of HRP2 antigenemia following treatment of an acute infection. The
      two-step diagnostic algorithm utilizing microscopy as a confirmatory test for
      indeterminate HRP2+/pLDH- results showed significantly improved specificity with 
      little loss of sensitivity in a high-transmission setting.

AB  - Plasmodium vivax has been reported to cause severe malaria, and one of the main
      resulting complications is anemia. Considering that P. vivax infects only young
      erythrocytes, anemia has been associated with the destruction of infected and
      non-infected erythrocytes. However, few studies have focused on understanding the
      relationship between the pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria and human genetic
      polymorphisms. Although ABO groups seem to influence the outcome of Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria, the association between P. vivax and ABO blood groups has
      been minimally investigated. Thus, we investigate the correlation between ABO
      blood groups and anemia induced by P. vivax infection. Five single nucleotide
      polymorphisms at the ABO gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and Real-Time PCR in P. 
      vivax-infected subjects. The ABO blood types were associated with the
      hematological data of the patients. Our main finding was that type O
      infected-individuals showed lower levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to
      type A-infected individuals. The correlation between ABO blood groups and
      hemoglobin levels remained significant when a multiple linear regression was
      applied with the possible confounding effects of clinical-epidemiologic variables
      taken into account. The finding that type O individuals have a higher frequency
      of anemia is a first step to understand the mechanisms involved in malaria
      anemia, which could be associated to increased destruction of type O
      erythrocytes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Botswana is one of the four front line malaria elimination countries 
      in Southern Africa, with malaria control activities that include routine vector
      control. Past and recent studies have shown that Anopheles arabiensis is the only
      known vector of Plasmodium parasites in the country. This report presents a
      preliminary evaluation on Anopheles species composition in seven districts of
      Botswana with some inferences on their vectorial role. RESULTS: Overall, 404
      Anopheles mosquito females were collected, of which 196 were larvae collected
      from several breeding sites, and 208 were adults obtained from indoor pyrethrum
      spray catches (PSC). Anopheles arabiensis (58.9%) accounted for the highest
      relative frequency in 5 out of 7 districts sampled. The other species collected, 
      among those identified, were barely represented: Anopheles longipalpis type C
      (16.3%), Anopheles parensis (8.9%), Anopheles quadriannulatus (5.4%), and
      Anopheles leesoni (0.2%). PCR test for human beta-globin on mosquitoes collected 
      by PSC showed that An. arabiensis and An. parensis had bitten human hosts.
      Moreover, An. arabiensis showed a non-negligible Plasmodium falciparum infection 
      rate in two sites (3.0% and 2.5% in Chobe and Kweneng West districts,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This work provides first time evidence of Anopheles
      diversity in several areas of Botswana. Anopheles arabiensis is confirmed to be
      widespread in all the sampled districts and to be vector of P. falciparum.
      Moreover, the presence of Anopheles funestus group in Botswana has been assessed.
      Further research, entomological surveillance activities and possibly vector
      control programmes need to be better developed and implemented as well as
      targeting outdoors resting vectors.

AB  - Antimalarial drug resistance exacerbates the global disease burden and
      complicates eradication efforts. To facilitate the surveillance of resistance
      markers in countries of malaria endemicity, we developed a suite of TaqMan assays
      for known resistance markers and compartmentalized them into a single array card 
      (TaqMan array card, TAC). We included 87 assays for species identification, for
      the detection of Plasmodium falciparum mutations associated with chloroquine,
      atovaquone, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and artemisinin resistance, and for
      neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Assay performance was
      first optimized using DNA from common laboratory parasite lines and plasmid
      controls. The limit of detection was 0.1 to 10 pg of DNA and yielded 100%
      accuracy compared to sequencing. The tool was then evaluated on 87 clinical blood
      samples from around the world, and the malaria TAC once again achieved 100%
      accuracy compared to sequencing and in addition detected the presence of mixed
      infections in clinical samples. With its streamlined protocol and high accuracy, 
      this malaria TAC should be a useful tool for large-scale antimalarial resistance 
      surveillance.

AB  - The gold standard for malaria diagnosis is the microscopic examination of Giemsa 
      stained thick blood smears though microscopy mostly may not detect the presence
      of Plasmodium species infections in asymptomatic samples. In the reported study, 
      we used two diagnostic methods viz. the conventional microscopic examination and 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to analyse the asymptomatic malaria
      samples. PCR assay amplifying 18S small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of 
      Plasmodium in 122 samples confirmed 68% of isolates as asymptomatic P. falciparum
      infections; with 87.9% mono-infections. We observed that the P. malariae positive
      samples were not diagnosed in microscopic examination of the blood smears but the
      PCR based diagnostic method revealed the presence of 12% P. malariae infections
      in asymptomatic samples from Yaounde region of Cameroon where no official cases
      of P. malariae have been reported for over a decade. The sequence analysis
      further confirmed the presence of 12% P. malariae in malaria positive samples
      with three base pair deletions and five substitutions in the SSU rRNA gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2014-15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic strained health
      systems in west Africa already overburdened with other diseases, including
      malaria. Because EVD and malaria can be difficult to distinguish clinically, and 
      rapid testing was not available in many Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), guidelines 
      recommended empirical malaria treatment. Little is known, however, about the
      prevalence and characteristics of patients entering an ETU who were infected with
      malaria parasites, either alone or concurrently with Ebola virus. METHODS: Data
      for sociodemographics, disease characteristics, and mortality were analysed for
      patients with suspected EVD admitted to three ETUs in Sierra Leone using a
      retrospective cohort design. Testing for Ebola virus was done by real-time PCR
      and for malaria by a rapid diagnostic test. Characteristics of patients were
      compared and survival analyses were done to evaluate the effect of infection
      status on mortality. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2014, and Oct 15, 2015, 1524 cases 
      were treated at the three ETUs for suspected EVD, of whom 1368 (90%) had
      diagnostic data for malaria and EVD. Median age of patients was 29 years (IQR
      20-44) and 715 (52%) were men. 1114 patients were EVD negative, of whom 365 (33%)
      tested positive for malaria. Of 254 EVD positive patients, 53 (21%) also tested
      positive for malaria. Mortality risk was highest in patients diagnosed with both 
      EVD and malaria (35 [66%] of 53 died) and patients diagnosed with EVD alone (105 
      [52%] of 201 died). Compared with patients presenting to ETUs without malaria or 
      EVD, mortality was increased in the malaria positive and EVD positive group
      (adjusted hazard ratio 9.36, 95% CI 6.18-14.18, p<0.0001), and the malaria
      negative and EVD positive group (5.97, 4.44-8.02, p<0.0001), but reduced in the
      malaria positive and EVD negative group (0.37, 0.20-1.23, p=0.0010).
      INTERPRETATION: Malaria parasite co-infection was common in patients presenting
      to ETUs and conferred an increased mortality risk in patients infected with Ebola
      virus, supporting empirical malaria treatment in ETUs. The high mortality among
      patients without EVD or malaria suggests expanded testing and treatment might
      improve care in future EVD epidemics. FUNDING: International Medical Corps.

AB  - Infections caused by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax account for more than 90%
      of global malaria burden. Exposure to malaria parasite elicits immune responses
      during natural infection and it is generally believed that the immunity is not
      only stage specific but also species specific. However, partial genomic
      similarity for various antigens in different Plasmodium spp. raises the
      possibility of immunological cross-reactivity at the level of specific antigens. 
      Serum samples collected from children who were permanent residents of a P.
      falciparum transmission area in Zimbabwe were screened for antibody reactivity
      against Pfs48/45, a P. falciparum gametocyte antigen and Pvs48/45, a P. vivax
      homolog of Pfs48/45 using ELISA. Western blotting was used to further confirm
      identity of the specific antibody reactivity to the Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45
      proteins. Pan Plasmodium PCR and nested PCR were used to confirm infection with
      the Plasmodium species. Twenty-seven percent (49/181) of the participants were
      found to be sero-positive for Pfs48/45 and 73% (n=36) of these Pfs48/45 positive 
      sera also showed reactivity with Pvs48/45. Immune cross-reactivity revealed by
      ELISA was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a panel of randomly
      selected 23 Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45 ELISA positive samples. Nested PCR analysis of 
      27 blood samples randomly selected from the 36 that showed positive ELISA
      reactivity to both Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45 antigens confirmed infection with P.
      falciparum and generalized absence of P. vivax except for a single sample which
      revealed PCR positivity for both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Our studies with
      sera samples from a predominantly P. falciparum transmission area in Zimbabwe
      suggest immunological cross-reactivity with Pvs48/45, thus raising the
      possibility of partial species cross-reactive immunity and possible
      cross-boosting of immunity during co-infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax.

TI  - The shape of the iceberg: quantification of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum 
      and Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia and gametocytaemia in five low endemic settings
      in Ethiopia.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1749-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread presence of low-density asymptomatic infections with
      concurrent gametocytes may be a stumbling block for malaria elimination. This
      study investigated the asymptomatic reservoir of Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax infections in schoolchildren from five settings in northwest
      Ethiopia. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in June and
      November 2015, enrolling 551 students from five schools and 294 students from
      three schools, respectively. Finger prick whole blood and plasma samples were
      collected. The prevalence and density of P. falciparum and P. vivax parasitaemia 
      and gametocytaemia were determined by 18S rRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pfs25 
      and pvs25 reverse transcriptase qPCR. Antibodies against blood stage antigens
      apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-119) were 
      measured for both species. RESULTS: Whilst only 6 infections were detected by
      microscopy in 881 slides (0.7%), 107 of 845 blood samples (12.7%) were parasite
      positive by (DNA-based) qPCR. qPCR parasite prevalence between sites and surveys 
      ranged from 3.8 to 19.0% for P. falciparum and 0.0 to 9.0% for P. vivax. The
      median density of P. falciparum infections (n = 85) was 24.4 parasites/microL
      (IQR 18.0-34.0) and the median density of P. vivax infections (n = 28) was 16.4
      parasites/microL (IQR 8.8-55.1). Gametocyte densities by (mRNA-based) qRT-PCR
      were strongly associated with total parasite densities for both P. falciparum
      (correlation coefficient = 0.83, p = 0.010) and P. vivax (correlation coefficient
      = 0.58, p = 0.010). Antibody titers against P. falciparum AMA-1 and MSP-119 were 
      higher in individuals who were P. falciparum parasite positive in both surveys (p
      < 0.001 for both comparisons). DISCUSSION: This study adds to the available
      evidence on the wide-scale presence of submicroscopic parasitaemia by quantifying
      submicroscopic parasite densities and concurrent gametocyte densities. There was 
      considerable heterogeneity in the occurrence of P. falciparum and P. vivax
      infections and serological markers of parasite exposure between the examined low 
      endemic settings in Ethiopia.

TI  - Molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance falciparum malaria among migrant
      goldmine workers in Myanmar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance has been reported in Greater Mekong Sub-region
      countries, including Myanmar. After discovery of artemisinin resistance marker
      (K13), molecular surveillance on artemisinin resistance in endemic regions have
      been conducted. As the migrant population represents a high percentage of malaria
      cases, molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance among migrant workers is 
      of great concern. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shwegyin
      Township, where migrants work in the goldmines. Blood samples were collected from
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum-infected migrant workers by active and
      passive cases screening with rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and microscopy.
      Amplification and sequence analysis of artemisinin resistance molecular markers, 
      such as k13, pfarps10, pffd, pfmdr2, pfmrp1, pfrad5, and pfcnbp, were carried out
      and pfmdr1 copy number analysis was conducted by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Among
      the 100 falciparum-infected patients, most were male (90%), of working age (20-40
      years) with median parasite density of 11,166 parasites/microL (range 270-110,472
      parasites/microL). Artemisinin resistance molecular marker, k13 mutations were
      detected in (21/100, 21.0%) in which composed of a validated marker, C580Y (9/21,
      42.9%) and candidate markers such as P574L (5/21, 23.8%), P667T (5/21, 23.8%) and
      M476I (2/21, 9.5%). Underlying genetic markers predisposing to become k13 mutants
      were found as V127M of pfarps10 (41/100, 41.0%), D153Y of pffd (64/100, 64.0%),
      T484I of pfmdr2 (58/100, 58.0%) and F1390I of pfmrp1 (24/100, 24.0%). The pfmdr1 
      copy number analysis revealed six copy numbers (1/100, 1.0%), three (2/100,
      2.0%), two (8/100, 8.0%) and only one copy number (89/100, 89.0%). Only one
      sample showed both k13 mutation (P667T) and multiple copy number of pfmdr1.
      CONCLUSIONS: High mutant rate of artemisinin resistance markers and relatively
      high pfmdr1 copy number among isolates collected from migrant goldmine workers
      alert the importance of containment measures among this target population.
      Clinical and molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance among migrants
      should be scaled up.

AB  - Artemisinin resistance containment in Myanmar was initiated in 2011 after

      evidence suggests that asymptomatic malaria infections harboring drug resistance 
      genes are present among residents of the Myanmar artemisinin resistance
      containment zone. This evidence supports efforts to eliminate these hidden
      infections.

AB  - We screened >40,000 patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
      deficiency and found that the G6PD Kaiping allele was under the most positive
      selection for fighting against malaria in the Chinese population. However, the
      mechanism is unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the
      anti-malarial effect and mechanism of G6PD deficiency. Dehydroepiandrosterone
      (DHEA) was utilised for inhibiting the G6PD activity of erythrocytes. Giemsa
      staining of blood smears and quantitative real-time PCR were used for the
      detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum infection. A transmission
      electron microscope was used to observe the structural changes of P. falciparum. 
      An atomic force microscopy was used for the analyses of morphology, roughness and
      Young's Modulus of the infective erythrocyte membrane. When G6PD activity was
      inhibited by DHEA, the infection rate of P. falciparum decreased, its cell
      nucleus shrank, the cell organelles and metabolites were reduced gradually and
      the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane increased with increasing DHEA
      concentrations. These data indicated that Plasmodium multiplication would be
      inhibited in G6PD deficient erythrocytes because the Plasmodium organelles could 
      not obtain enough nutrients, including ribose-5-phosphate and the reducing
      equivalent, NADPH. Moreover, the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane
      increased, which resulted in an increased membrane stiffness and decreased
      deformation. It was difficult for the merozoites to invade erythrocytes through
      endocytosis. Understanding these points will have a major effect on searching for
      new anti-malarial drug targets.

      North Sumatera, Indonesia.
PG  - 1148-1155
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jix091 [doi]
AB  - Background: As Indonesia works toward the goal of malaria elimination,
      information is lacking on malaria epidemiology from some western provinces. As a 
      basis for studies of antimalarial efficacy, we set out to survey parasite
      carriage in 3 communities in North Sumatera Province. Methods: A combination of
      active and passive detection of infection was carried out among communities in
      Batubara, Langkat, and South Nias regencies. Finger-prick blood samples from
      consenting individuals of all ages provided blood films for microscopic
      examination and blood spots on filter paper. Plasmodium species were identified
      using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ribosomal RNA genes and a novel
      assay that amplifies a conserved sequence specific for the sicavar gene family of
      Plasmodium knowlesi. Results: Of 3731 participants, 614 (16.5%) were positive for
      malaria parasites by microscopy. PCR detected parasite DNA in samples from 1169
      individuals (31.3%). In total, 377 participants (11.8%) harbored P. knowlesi.
      Also present were Plasmodium vivax (14.3%), Plasmodium falciparum (10.5%) and
      Plasmodium malariae (3.4%). Conclusions: Amplification of sicavar is a specific
      and sensitive test for the presence of P. knowlesi DNA in humans. Subpatent and
      asymptomatic multispecies parasitemia is relatively common in North Sumatera, so 
      PCR-based surveillance is required to support control and elimination activities.

      of Plasmodium falciparum parasites.
PG  - 69
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1714-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture lines from
      patient parasite isolates can offer deeper understanding of geographic variations
      of drug sensitivity and mechanisms of malaria pathogenesis and immunity.
      Cellulose column filtration of blood is an inexpensive, rapid and effective
      method for the removal of host factors, such as leucocytes and platelets,
      significantly improving the purification of parasite DNA in a blood sample.
      METHODS: In this study, the effect of cellulose column filtration of venous blood
      on the initial in vitro growth of P. falciparum parasite isolates from Tanzanian 
      children admitted to hospital was tested. The parasites were allowed to expand in
      culture without subcultivation until 5 days after admission or the appearance of 
      dead parasites and parasitaemia was determined daily. To investigate whether the 
      filtration had an effect on clonality, P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 
      genotyping was performed using nested PCR on extracted genomic DNA, and the var
      gene transcript levels were investigated, using quantitative PCR on extracted
      RNA, at admission and 4 days of culture. RESULTS: The cellulose-filtered
      parasites grew to higher parasitaemia faster than non-filtered parasites
      seemingly due to a higher development ratio of ring stage parasites progressing
      into the late stages. Cellulose filtration had no apparent effect on clonality or
      var gene expression; however, evident differences were observed after only 4 days
      of culture in both the number of clones and transcript levels of var genes
      compared to the time of admission. CONCLUSIONS: Cellulose column filtration of
      parasitized blood is a cheap, applicable method for improving cultivation of P.
      falciparum field isolates for ex vivo based assays; however, when assessing
      phenotype and genotype of cultured parasites, in general, assumed to represent
      the in vivo infection, caution is advised.

TI  - A PCR method based on 18S rRNA gene for detection of malaria parasite in
      Balochistan.
PG  - 1587-1591
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a polymerase chain reaction method based on 18S ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid gene for the detection of plasmodium deoxyribonucleic acid in
      patients suffering from malaria symptoms. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was
      conducted from September 2013 to October 2014 in district Quetta of Pakistan's
      Balochistan province. Blood samples were collected from patients suffering from
      general symptoms of malaria. A polymerase chain reaction-based technique was
      applied for the diagnosis of malaria and detection of responsible species in the 
      patients who were suspected to carry the parasite. Performance of this polymerase
      chain reaction method was compared against the microscopy results. Parasite
      number was also calculated for microscopy positive samples.All samples after the 
      genomic deoxyribonucleic acid isolation were subjected to polymerase chain
      reaction amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Of the 200
      samples, 114(57%) were confirmed as positive and 86(43%) as negative for malaria 
      by microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction identified 124(62%) samples as positive 
      and 76(38%) as negative for malaria. The comparative analysis of both diagnostic 
      methods confirmed 109(54.5%) samples as positive by both techniques. Besides,
      5(6.58%) samples were identified as false positive and 15(12.1%) samples as false
      negative by polymerase chain reaction. Sensitivity, specificity and positive
      predictive values for polymerase chain reaction in comparison to microscopy were 
      87.98%, 93.42% and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Polymerase chain
      reaction-based methods in malaria diagnosis and species identification were found
      to be more effective than other techniques.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and effects of artemisinin-based combination treatments on
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria -associated anaemia in Nigerian
      children during seven years of adoption as first-line treatments.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s40249-016-0217-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) are the first-line
      treatments of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many endemic areas
      but there are few evaluation of their efficacy in anaemic malarious children.
      METHODS: Therapeutic efficacy of 3-day regimens of artesunate-amodiaquine and
      artemether-lumefantrine was evaluated in 437 anaemic and 909 non-anaemic
      malarious children following treatment during a seven-year period (2008-2014).
      Patterns of temporal changes in haematocrit were classified based on haematocrit 
      values <30% and >/=30%. Kinetics of the disposition of the deficit in haematocrit
      from 30% following treatment were evaluated using a non-compartment model.
      RESULTS: PCR-corrected parasitological efficacy 28 days after start of treatment 
      was significantly higher in artesunate-amodiaquine- compared to
      artemether-lumefantrine-treated children [97% (95%CI: 92.8-100) versus 96.4%
      (95%CI: 91.3-99.4), P = 0.02], but it was similar in non-anaemic and anaemic
      children. Fall in haematocrit/1 000 asexual parasites cleared from peripheral
      blood was significantly greater at lower compared to higher parasitaemias (P <
      0.0001), and in non-anaemic compared to anaemic children (P = 0.007). In anaemic 
      children at presentation, mean anaemia recovery time (AnRT) was 15.4 days (95%CI:
      13.3-17.4) and it did not change over the years. Declines in haematocrit deficits
      from 30% were monoexponential with mean estimated half-time of 1.4 days (95%CI:
      1.2-1.6). Anaemia half-time (t(1/2)anaemia) correlated positively with AnRT in
      the same patients (r = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis of 10 multiples
      of t(1/2)anaemia and AnRT showed narrow limit of agreement with insignificant
      bias (P = 0.07) suggesting both can be used interchangeably in the same patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine remain
      efficacious treatments of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in non-anaemic
      and anaemic Nigerian children in the last 7 years of adoption as first-line
      treatments. These ACTs may also conserve haematocrit at high parasitaemias and in
      anaemic children. TRIALS REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trial Registry

TI  - High Plasmodium falciparum longitudinal prevalence is associated with high
      multiclonality and reduced clinical malaria risk in a seasonal transmission area 
      of Mali.
PG  - e0170948
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0170948 [doi]
AB  - The effects of persistent Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection and multiclonality
      on subsequent risk of clinical malaria have been reported, but the relationship
      between these 2 parameters and their relative impacts on the clinical outcome of 
      infection are not understood. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a
      seasonal and high-transmission area of Mali, in which 500 subjects aged 1-65
      years were followed for 1 year. Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks, and
      incident malaria cases were diagnosed and treated. Pf infection in each
      individual at each time point was assessed by species-specific nested-PCR, and Pf
      longitudinal prevalence per person (PfLP, proportion of Pf-positive samples over 
      1 year) was calculated. Multiclonality of Pf infection was measured using a
      24-SNP DNA barcoding assay at 4 time-points (two in wet season, and two in dry
      season) over one year. PfLP was positively correlated with multiclonality at each
      time point (all r>/=0.36; all P</=0.011). When host factors (e.g., age, gender), 
      PfLP, and multiclonality (at the beginning of the transmission season) were
      analyzed together, only increasing age and high PfLP were associated with reduced
      clinical malaria occurrence or reduced number of malaria episodes (for both
      outcomes, P<0.001 for age, and P = 0.005 for PfLP). When age, PfLP and baseline
      Pf positivity were analyzed together, the effect of high PfLP remained
      significant even after adjusting for the other two factors (P = 0.001 for malaria
      occurrence and P<0.001 for number of episodes). In addition to host age and
      baseline Pf positivity, both of which have been reported as important modifiers
      of clinical malaria risk, our results demonstrate that persistent parasite
      carriage, but not baseline multiclonality, is associated with reduced risk of
      clinical disease in this population. Our study emphasizes the importance of
      considering repeated parasite exposure in future studies that evaluate clinical
      malaria risk.

TI  - Efficacy of artesunate + sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemether + lumefantrine
      and dhfr and dhps mutations in Somalia: evidence for updating the malaria
      treatment policy.
PG  - 415-422
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12847 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic efficacy of artesunate +
      sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS + SP) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL), and to
      investigate the presence of molecular mutations associated with resistance, to
      inform national malaria treatment policy. METHODS: One-arm prospective studies
      were conducted in three study sites in Somalia in 2013 and 2015 to evaluate the
      efficacy of AS + SP and AL among patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. 
      Outcomes included clinical and parasitological response over 28 days, and the
      presence of dihydrofolate reductase (dfhr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps)
      and mutations. RESULTS: Among patients treated with AS + SP, the PCR-corrected
      treatment failure rate was 12.3%. The majority of patients (89%) carried either
      the quintuple mutations (51I/108N + 437G/540E/581G or 51I/59R/108N + 437G/540E)
      or the quadruple mutation (51I/108N + 437G/540E). All patients who failed
      treatment with AS + SP carried the quintuple mutation (51I/108N +
      437G/540E/581G). In the studies of AL, the PCR-corrected treatment failure rate
      was <6%. All patients in both treatment groups cleared their parasitaemia by day 
      3. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate a failing first-line treatment (AS +
      SP), with a failure rate above the threshold (10%) for policy change, and a high 
      prevalence of quintuple mutations. In contrast, AL was highly efficacious. Based 
      on these findings and the results from a previous AS + SP study, AL was selected 
      to replace AS + SP as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in
      Somalia in 2016. Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (DHA + PPQ) has been
      recommended as the second-line treatment. Routine monitoring of recommended ACTs 
      should continue to inform treatment policy.

TI  - Reduced ex vivo susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum after oral
      artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Mali.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the recommended first-line
      treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide. However, recent studies
      conducted in Mali showed an increased frequency of recurrent parasitaemia
      following artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment. METHODS: Study samples were
      collected during a large WANECAM study. Ex-vivo Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity
      to artemether and lumefantrine was assessed using the tritiated
      hypoxanthine-based assay. The prevalence of molecular markers of anti-malarial
      drug resistance (pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y and K13-propeller) were measured by PCR 
      and/or sequencing. RESULTS: Overall 61 samples were successfully analysed in ex
      vivo studies. Mean IC50s increased significantly between baseline and recurrent
      parasites for both artemether (1.6 nM vs 3.2 nM, p < 0.001) and lumefantrine (1.4
      nM vs 3.4 nM, p = 0.004). Wild type Pfmdr1 N86 allele was selected after
      treatment (71 vs 91%, 112 of 158 vs 95 of 105, p < 0.001) but not the wild type
      pfcrt K76 variant (23.5 vs 24.8%, 40 of 170 vs 26 of 105, p = 0.9). Three
      non-synonymous K13-propeller SNPs (A522C, A578S, and G638R) were found with
      allele frequencies <2%. CONCLUSION: Malian post-AL P. falciparum isolates were
      less susceptible to artemether and lumefantrine than baseline isolates.

TI  - Submicroscopic Plasmodium prevalence in relation to malaria incidence in 20
      villages in western Cambodia.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1703-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cambodia has seen a marked reduction in the incidence of Plasmodium
      falciparum over the past decade without a corresponding decline in Plasmodium
      vivax incidence. It is unknown to what extent local transmission is sustained by 
      a chain of clinical and sub-clinical infections or by continued re-introduction
      via migration. Using an ultrasensitive molecular technique, 20 villages in
      western Cambodia were surveyed to detect the low season prevalence of P.
      falciparum and P. vivax and local treatment records were reviewed. METHODS:
      During March to May 2015 cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 20 villages in
      Battambang, western Cambodia. Demographic and epidemiological data and venous
      blood samples were collected from 50 randomly selected adult volunteers in each
      village. Blood was tested for Plasmodium infections by rapid diagnostic test
      (RDT), microscopy and high volume (0.5 ml packed red blood cell) quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (uPCR). Positive samples were analysed by nested PCR to
      determine the Plasmodium species. Malaria case records were collected from the
      Provincial Health Department and village malaria workers to determine incidence
      and migration status. RESULTS: Among the 1000 participants, 91 (9.1%) were
      positive for any Plasmodium infection by uPCR, seven (0.7%) by microscopy, and
      two (0.2%) by RDT. uPCR P. vivax prevalence was 6.6%, P. falciparum 0.7%, and
      undetermined Plasmodium species 1.8%. Being male (adjusted OR 2.0; 95% CI
      1.2-3.4); being a young adult <30 years (aOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.4); recent forest 
      travel (aOR 2.8; 95% CI 1.6-4.8); and, a history of malaria (aOR 5.2; 95% CI
      2.5-10.7) were independent risk factors for parasitaemia. Of the clinical malaria
      cases diagnosed by village malaria workers, 43.9% (297/634) and 38.4% (201/523)
      were among migrants in 2013 and in 2014, respectively. Plasmodium vivax
      prevalence determined by uPCR significantly correlated with vivax malaria
      incidences in both 2014 and 2015 (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively), whereas no 
      relationship was observed in falciparum malaria (p = 0.36 and p = 0.59,
      respectively). DISCUSSION: There was heterogeneity in the malaria parasite
      reservoir between villages, and Plasmodium prevalence correlated with subsequent 
      malaria incidence. The association was attributable chiefly to P. vivax
      infections, which were nine-fold more prevalent than P. falciparum infections. In
      the absence of a radical cure with 8-aminoquinolines, P. vivax transmission will 
      continue even as P. falciparum prevalence declines. Migration was associated with
      over a third of incident cases of clinical malaria. Trial registration

TI  - Effect of a short course of iron polymaltose on acquisition of malarial
      parasitaemia in anaemic Indonesian schoolchildren: a randomized trial.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1691-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern exists about the safety of iron supplementation given to
      individuals in malarious areas. The possible unfavourable impact of iron
      supplementation on malaria might be less when slow-release iron compounds are
      used instead of ferrous salts, because no toxic non-transferrin bound iron is
      formed. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of iron supplementation
      using the slow-release iron compound iron polymaltose (IPM) on the acquisition of
      malarial parasitaemia. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was
      performed in schoolchildren aged 5-18 years with mild or moderate anaemia on the 
      Indonesian island Flores. Microscopic malaria-negative children were randomized
      to receive 8 weeks of IPM (6 mg elemental iron/kg/day) or placebo . The primary
      outcomes were the occurrence of microscopically detectable malarial parasitaemia 
      at week 4, 8, 12 and 16 after start of treatment and the proportion of
      participants with real-time (RT) PCR positive malarial parasitaemia at week 16.
      RESULTS: 294 Children were assigned to the IPM group and 297 to the placebo
      group. Whereas IPM supplementation failed to increased haemoglobin or ferritin
      concentrations, the IPM group had a significantly higher rate of occurrence of
      microscopically detectable parasitaemia [hazard ratio 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.2-4.0; P = 
      0.01]. This higher rate was confined to iron-replete children. At the end of the 
      study, 89% of the children in the IPM group had remained free from
      microscopically detectable parasitaemia vs 95% of children in the placebo group. 
      The proportion of plasmodial RT-PCR positive children was similar in both groups 
      at week 16 (IPM group 16.6% vs placebo group 14.3%; P = 0.47). When analysis was 
      restricted to iron-replete children (serum ferritin >/=30 microg/l), there was a 
      trend for a higher proportion being RT-PCR positive at week 16 in the IPM group
      compared with the placebo group (20 vs 13.3%; P = 0.07). Erythrocyte microcytosis
      was an independent risk factor for microscopically detectable malarial
      parasitaemia. CONCLUSIONS: A short course of IPM should be used cautiously in
      anaemic children in malaria endemic areas, as it has limited efficacy in treating
      iron deficiency, while it increases the rate of microscopic malarial parasitaemia
      in those with replete iron stores. Trial registration ISRCTN 83091970. Registered

TI  - Simplified Pan-species Real-time PCR-based Detection of Plasmodium Spp. in Blood 
      Smear.
PG  - 463-470
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to quicken and simplify the detection of Plasmodium in blood
      samples by developing and testing a pan-Plasmodium real-time PCR for accurate
      screening of individuals suspected of malaria. METHODS: A single primer/probe set
      for pan-species Plasmodium-specific real time PCR targeting a conserved region of
      the small subunit 18S ribosomal DNA was designed and evaluated for rapid
      diagnosis and screening of malaria infections using dried blood smears. FTA cards
      were used for rapid and simple DNA extraction. RESULTS: The primers and probes
      showed a positive response with the DNA extracted from bloods infected with P.
      falciparum and P. vivax but not with DNA extracted from various smears from
      uninfected blood samples. Seven positive cases positive by both microscopy and
      nested PCR were found among 280 blood samples taken from in South and Southeast
      Iran. Five samples were identified as positive for P. vivax and two as positive
      for P. falciparum. All positive samples were positive by real-time PCR.
      Furthermore, all 38-blood samples positive by microscopy were positive by
      real-time PCR. No microscopy-negative samples were positive by real-time PCR.
      CONCLUSION: By using a simple FTA card for DNA extraction and by application of
      the real-time PCR developed in this study, sensitivity similar to nested-PCR and 
      microscopy was achieved. This format simplifies the detection of Plasmodium in
      large numbers of samples.

TI  - Beyond the entomological inoculation rate: characterizing multiple blood feeding 
      behavior and Plasmodium falciparum multiplicity of infection in Anopheles
      mosquitoes in northern Zambia.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-1993-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A commonly used measure of malaria transmission intensity is the
      entomological inoculation rate (EIR), defined as the product of the human biting 
      rate (HBR) and sporozoite infection rate (SIR). The EIR excludes molecular
      parameters that may influence vector control and surveillance strategies. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate Anopheles multiple blood feeding
      behavior (MBF) and Plasmodium falciparum multiplicity of infection (MOI) within
      the mosquito host in Nchelenge District, northern Zambia. Mosquitoes were
      collected from light traps and pyrethroid spray catch in Nchelenge in the 2013
      wet season. All anophelines were tested for blood meal host, P. falciparum, and
      MOI using PCR. Circumsporozoite (CSP) ELISA and microsatellite analysis were
      performed to detect parasites in the mosquito and MBF, respectively. Statistical 
      analyses used regression models to assess MBF and MOI and exact binomial test for
      human sex bias. Both MBF and MOI can enhance our understanding of malaria
      transmission dynamics beyond what is currently understood through conventional
      EIR estimates alone. RESULTS: The dominant malaria vectors collected in Nchelenge
      were Anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) and An. gambiae (s.s.) The EIRs of An.
      funestus (s.s.) and An. gambiae (s.s.) were 39.6 infectious bites/person/6 months
      (ib/p/6mo) and 5.9 ib/p/6mo, respectively, and took multiple human blood meals at
      high rates, 23.2 and 25.7% respectively. There was no bias in human host sex
      preference in the blood meals. The SIR was further characterized for parasite
      genetic diversity. The overall P. falciparum MOI was 6.4 in infected vectors,
      exceeding previously reported average MOIs in humans in Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      Anopheles MBF rates and P. falciparum MOI in Nchelenge were among some of the
      highest reported in sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggest an underestimation of
      the EIR and large numbers of circulating parasite clones. Together, the results
      describe important molecular aspects of transmission excluded from the
      traditional EIR measurement. These elements may provide more sensitive measures
      with which to assess changes in transmission intensity and risk in vector and
      parasite surveillance programs.

AB  - The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) provides valuable information about
      both the functional and evolutionary aspects of genetic diversity. Comparative
      analysis of 3 Plasmodium falciparum genomes has shown that more than 9% of its
      open reading frames (ORFs) harbor VNTRs. Although microsatellites and VNTR genes 
      of P. vivax were reported, the VNTR polymorphism of genes has not been examined
      widely. In this study, 230 P. vivax genes were analyzed for VNTRs by SERV, and 33
      kinds of TR deletions or insertions from 29 P. vivax genes (12.6%) were found. Of
      these, 9 VNTR fragments from 8 P. vivax genes were used for PCR amplification and
      sequence analysis to examine the genetic diversity among 134 isolates from four
      Southeast Asian countries (China, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar) with 
      different malaria endemicity. We confirmed the existence of extensive
      polymorphism of VNTR fragments in field isolates. This detection provides several
      suitable markers for analysis of the molecular epidemiology of P. vivax field
      isolates.

TI  - Recent uptake of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) used as intermittent
      preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) on mutant parasite selection has 
      been poorly documented in Burkina Faso. This study sought first to explore the
      relationship between IPTp-SP and the presence of mutant parasites. Second, to
      assess the relationship between the mutant parasites and adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. METHODS: From September to December 2010, dried blood spots (DBS) were 
      collected during antenatal care visits and at delivery from 109 pregnant women
      with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria infection. DBS were analysed by
      PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the polymorphisms at 
      codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 of the Pfdhfr gene and codons 437 and 540 in the
      Pfdhps gene. RESULTS: Both the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were successfully
      genotyped in 92.7% (101/109) of the samples. The prevalence of Pfdhfr mutations
      N51I, C59R and S108N was 71.3, 42.6 and 64.4%, respectively. Overall, 80.2%
      (81/101) of samples carried the Pfdhps A437G mutation. None of the samples had
      the Pfdhfr I164L and the Pfdhps K540E mutations. The prevalence of the triple
      mutation N51I + C59R + S108N was 25.7% (26/101). The use of IPTp-SP was
      associated with a threefold increased odds of Pfdhfr C59R mutation [crude OR
      3.29; 95% CI (1.44-7.50)]. Pregnant women with recent uptake of IPTp-SP were at
      higher odds of both the Pfdhfr C59R mutation [adjusted OR 4.26; 95% CI
      (1.64-11.07)] and the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance, i.e., >/= 2 Pfdhfr 
      mutations [adjusted OR 3.45; 95% CI (1.18-10.07)]. There was no statistically
      significant association between the presence of the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high
      resistance and parasite densities or both maternal haemoglobin level and anaemia.
      CONCLUSION: The data indicate that despite the possibility that IPTp-SP
      contributes to the selection of resistant parasites, it did not potentiate
      pregnancy-associated malaria morbidity, suggesting the continuation of SP use as 
      IPTp in Burkina Faso.

AB  - The highly sensitive and specific detection of Pfg377 gene of Plasmodium
      falciparum gametocyte using Magnetic Nanoparticles PCR Enzyme-Linked Gene Assay
      (MELGA) was successfully developed. The MELGA included amplification of the
      Pfg377 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using magnetic nanoparticles
      (MNPs)-conjugated forward primer and biotinylated reverse primer, followed by
      post-analytical process using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
      streptavidin (SA). The complexes of MELGA product were incubated with the
      peroxidase substrate and hydrogen peroxide to produce the signal for colorimetric
      measurement. Altogether, the MELGA technique provided a highly sensitive and
      specific detection at 1 P. falciparum gametocyte/microL, which was more efficient
      than that of microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
      Additionally, the MELGA could detect target gene at femtogram level, which was
      greater sensitive than the conventional PCR, nested PCR and loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (LAMP). The MELGA technique could become a novel and
      practical method that overcome limitation of traditional gametocyte detection.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the genetic diversity and complexity of Plasmodium
      falciparum infections in Kedougou, southeastern Senegal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic analyses of the malaria parasite population and its temporal 
      and spatial dynamics could provide an assessment of the effectiveness of disease 
      control strategies. The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been
      poorly documented in Senegal, and limited data are available from the Kedougou
      Region. This study examines the spatial and temporal variation of the genetic
      diversity and complexity of P. falciparum infections in acute febrile patients in
      Kedougou, southeastern Senegal. A total of 263 sera from patients presenting with
      acute febrile illness and attending Kedougou health facilities between July 2009 
      and July 2013 were obtained from a collection established as part of arbovirus
      surveillance in Kedougou. Samples identified as P. falciparum by nested PCR were 
      characterized for their genetic diversity and complexity using msp-1 and msp-2
      polymorphic markers. RESULTS: Samples containing only P. falciparum accounted for
      60.83% (160/263) of the examined samples. All three msp-1 allelic families (K1,
      MAD20 and RO33) and two msp-2 allelic families (FC27 and 3D7) were detected in
      all villages investigated over the 5-year collection period. The average genotype
      per allelic family was comparable between villages. Frequencies of msp-1 and
      msp-2 allelic types showed no correlation with age (Fisher's exact test, P =
      0.59) or gender (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.973), and were similarly distributed 
      throughout the 5-year sampling period (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.412) and across
      villages (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.866). Mean multiplicity of infection (MOI)
      for both msp-1 and msp-2 was highest in Kedougou village (2.25 and 2.21,
      respectively) and among younger patients aged </= 15 years (2.12 and 2.00,
      respectively). The mean MOI was highest in 2009 and decreased progressively
      onward. CONCLUSION: Characterization of the genetic diversity and complexity of
      P. falciparum infections in Kedougou revealed no spatio-temporal variation in the
      genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates. However, mean MOI varied with time
      of sera collection and decreased over the course of the study (July 2009 to July 
      2013). This suggests a slow progressive decrease of malaria transmission
      intensity in Kedougou Region despite the limited impact of preventive and control
      measures implemented by the National Malaria Control Programme on malaria
      morbidity and mortality.

      decrease in the absence of malaria transmission.
PG  - e2855
LID - 10.7717/peerj.2855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination campaigns are planned or active in many
      countries. The effects of malaria elimination on immune responses such as
      antigen-specific IFN- gamma responses are not well characterized. METHODS: IFN-
      gamma responses to the P. falciparum antigens circumsporozoite protein, liver
      stage antigen-1, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein, apical membrane
      antigen-1, MB2, and merozoite surface protein-1 were tested by ELISA in 243
      individuals in highland Kenya in April 2008, October 2008, and April 2009, after 
      a one-year period of interrupted malaria transmission from April 2007 to March
      2008. RESULTS: While one individual (0.4%) tested positive for P. falciparum by
      PCR inOctober 2008 and another two (0.9%) tested positive in April 2009, no
      clinical malaria cases were detected during weekly visits. Levels of IFN-gamma to
      all antigens decreased significantly from April 2008 to April 2009 (all P <
      0.001). DISCUSSION: Naturally acquired IFN- gamma responses to P. falciparum
      antigensare short-lived in the absence of repeated P. falciparum infection. Even 
      short periods of malaria interruption may significantly decrease IFN-gamma
      responses to P. falciparum antigens.

TI  - Providing lipid-based nutrient supplement during pregnancy does not reduce the
      risk of maternal P falciparum parasitaemia and reproductive tract infections: a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12884-016-1215-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal infections are associated with maternal and foetal adverse
      outcomes. Nutrient supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the occurrence of 
      infections by improving maternal immunity. We aimed to investigate the impact of 
      small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement (SQ-LNS) on the occurrence of
      Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia during pregnancy and trichomoniasis, vaginal
      candidiasis and urinary tract infection (UTI) after delivery. METHODS: Pregnant
      Malawian women enrolled in the iLiNS-DYAD trial receiving daily supplementation
      with SQ-LNS, multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron & folic acid (IFA) from <20
      gestation weeks (gw) were assessed for P. falciparum parasitaemia at 32 gw using 
      rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), at 36 gw using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      and at delivery using both RDT and PCR; and at one week after delivery for
      trichomoniasis and vaginal candidiasis using wet mount microscopy and for UTI
      using urine dipstick analysis. The prevalence of each infection by intervention
      group was estimated at the prescribed time points and the global null hypothesis 
      was tested using logistic regression. Adjusted analyses were performed using
      preselected covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was
      10.7% at 32 gw, 9% at 36 gw, and 8.3% by RDT and 20.2% by PCR at delivery. After 
      delivery the prevalence of trichomoniasis was 10.5%, vaginal candidiasis was
      0.5%, and UTI was 3.1%. There were no differences between intervention groups in 
      the prevalence of any of the infections. CONCLUSION: In this population, SQ-LNS
      did not influence the occurrence of maternal P. falciparum parasitaemia,
      trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis or UTI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Identifier:
      NCT01239693 (10 November 2010).

TI  - Direct detection of falciparum and non-falciparum malaria DNA from a drop of
      blood with high sensitivity by the dried-LAMP system.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1949-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the low sensitivity of conventional rapid diagnostic tests
      (RDTs) for malaria infections, the actual prevalence of the diseases, especially 
      those caused by non-Plasmodium falciparum (non-Pf) species, in asymptomatic
      populations remain less defined in countries lacking in well-equipped facilities 
      for accurate diagnoses. Our direct blood dry LAMP system (CZC-LAMP) was applied
      to the diagnosis of malaria as simple, rapid and highly sensitive method as an
      alternative for conventional RDTs in malaria endemic areas where laboratory
      resources are limited. RESULTS: LAMP primer sets for mitochondria DNAs of
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and human-infective species other than Pf (non-Pf; P. 
      vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae) were designed and tested by using human blood DNA
      samples from 74 residents from a malaria endemic area in eastern Zambia. These
      malaria dry-LAMPs were optimized for field or point-of-care operations, and
      evaluated in the field at a malaria endemic area in Zambia with 96 human blood
      samples. To determine the sensitivities and specificities, results obtained by
      the on-site LAMP diagnosis were compared with those by the nested PCR and
      nucleotide sequencing of its product. The dry LAMPs showed the sensitivities of
      89.7% for Pf and 85.7% for non-Pf, and the specificities of 97.2% for Pf and 100%
      for non-Pf, with purified blood DNA samples. The direct blood LAMP diagnostic
      methods, in which 1 mul of anticoagulated blood were used as the template, showed
      the sensitivities of 98.1% for Pf, 92.1% for non-Pf, and the specificities of
      98.1% for Pf, 100% for non-Pf. The prevalences of P. falciparum, P. malariae and 
      P. ovale in the surveyed area were 52.4, 25.3 and 10.6%, respectively, indicating
      high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in endemic areas in Zambia. CONCLUSIONS:
      We have developed new field-applicable malaria diagnostic tests. The malaria
      CZC-LAMPs showed high sensitivity and specificity to both P. falciparum and
      non-P. falciparum. These malaria CZC-LAMPs provide new means for rapid, sensitive
      and reliable point-of-care diagnosis for low-density malaria infections, and are 
      expected to help update current knowledge of malaria epidemiology, and can
      contribute to the elimination of malaria from endemic areas.

TI  - Detection of Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in a co-endemic area in
      Malaysia.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1676-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia. 
      However, microscopic diagnosis is inaccurate and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      are insufficiently sensitive. PCR is sensitive and specific but not feasible at a
      district level. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) shows potential
      with only basic requirements. A commercially available LAMP assay, the Eiken
      Loopamp MALARIA Pan Detection kit, is sensitive for Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax, but has not previously been evaluated for P. knowlesi. This
      study aims to determine the sensitivity of this LAMP assay for detecting P.
      knowlesi infection. METHODS: Study participants included 73 uncomplicated malaria
      patients with PCR species confirmation: 50 P. knowlesi, 20 P. falciparum and 3 P.
      vivax. Nineteen malaria-negative, non-endemic area controls were also included.
      The sensitivity of the Eiken Loopamp MALARIA Pan Detection kit (Pan LAMP) for
      detecting each Plasmodium species was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of
      the Eiken Loopamp MALARIA Pf Detection kit (Pf LAMP) for P. falciparum were also 
      determined. The limit of detection for each LAMP assay was evaluated, with
      results compared to PCR. All P. knowlesi patients were also tested by CareStart
      (Pf/VOM) and OptiMAL-IT (Pan/Pf) RDTs. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the Pan LAMP
      assay was 100% for P. knowlesi (95% CI 92.9-100), P. falciparum (95% CI
      83.2-100), and P. vivax (95% CI 29.2-100). The Pf LAMP was 100% sensitive and
      specific for P. falciparum detection, with all P. knowlesi samples having a
      negative reaction. LAMP sensitivity was superior to both RDTs, with only 10 and
      28% of P. knowlesi samples testing positive to CareStart and OptiMAL-IT,
      respectively. Limit of detection using the Pan LAMP for both P. knowlesi and P.
      vivax was 2 parasites/muL, comparable to PCR. For P. falciparum both the Pan LAMP
      and Pf LAMP demonstrated a limit of detection of 20 parasites/muL. CONCLUSIONS:
      The Eiken Loopamp MALARIA Pan Detection kit is sensitive for detection of P.
      knowlesi in low parasitaemia clinical infections, as well as P. falciparum and P.
      vivax. However, a P. knowlesi-specific field assay in a simpler format would
      assist correct species identification and initiation of optimal treatment for all
      malaria patients.

TI  - Malaria Parasitemia and Parasite Density in Antiretroviral-Treated HIV-Infected
      Adults Following Discontinuation of Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis.
PG  - 88-94
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cotrimoxazole (CTX) discontinuation increases malaria incidence in
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Rates, quantity, and
      timing of parasitemia rebound following CTX remain undefined. METHODS: Serial
      specimens from a trial of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral
      treatment (ART) randomized to continue (the CTX arm) or discontinue (the STOP-CTX
      arm) were examined for malaria parasites by quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specimens obtained at enrollment and then
      quarterly for 12 months and at sick visits were assessed; multiplicity of
      infection was evaluated by PCR that targeted the polymorphic msp-1/msp-2 alleles.
      RESULTS: Among 500 HIV-infected adults receiving ART (median ART duration, 4.5
      years), 5% had detectable parasitemia at baseline. After randomization, parasite 
      prevalence increased over time in the STOP-CTX arm, compared with the CTX arm,
      with values of 4% and <1%, respectively, at month 3, 8% and 2% at month 6, 14%
      and 2% at month 9, and 22% and 4% at month 12 (P = .0034). The combined mean
      parasite density at the various time points was higher in the STOP-CTX arm (4.42 
      vs 3.13 log10 parasites/mL; P < .001). The parasitemia incidence was 42.0 cases
      per 100 person-years in the STOP-CTX arm and 9.9 cases per 100 person-years in
      the CTX arm, with an incidence rate ratio of 4.3 (95% confidence interval,
      2.7-7.1; P < .001). After enrollment, mixed infections (multiplicity of
      infection, >1) were only present in the STOP-CTX arm. CONCLUSION: Discontinuation
      of CTX by HIV-infected adults receiving ART resulted in progressive increases in 
      malaria parasitemia prevalence and burden. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION:

TI  - Absence of in vivo selection for K13 mutations after artemether-lumefantrine
      treatment in Uganda.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1663-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual drug treatment may select resistant parasites in the human
      body, a process termed in vivo selection. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms in
      Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug
      resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) genes have been reportedly selected after
      artemether-lumefantrine treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding 
      in vivo selection of P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain (pfkelch13)
      polymorphisms, responsible for artemisinin-resistance in Asia, and six putative
      background mutations for artemisinin resistance; D193Y in ferredoxin, T484I in
      multiple resistance protein 2, V127M in apicoplast ribosomal protein S10, I356T
      in pfcrt, V1157L in protein phosphatase and C1484F in phosphoinositide-binding
      protein. METHODS: Artemether-lumefantrine efficacy study with a follow-up period 
      of 28 days was conducted in northern Uganda in 2014. The above-mentioned
      genotypes were comparatively analysed before drug administration and on days; 3, 
      7, and 28 days after treatment. RESULTS: In 61 individuals with successful
      follow-up, artemether-lumefantrine treatment regimen was very effective with PCR 
      adjusted efficacy of 95.2%. Among 146 isolates obtained before treatment,
      wild-type alleles were observed in 98.6% of isolates in pfkelch13 and in all
      isolates in the six putative background genes except I356T in pfcrt, which had
      2.4% of isolates as mixed infections. In vivo selection study revealed that all
      isolates detected in the follow-up period harboured wild type alleles in
      pfkelch13 and the six background genes. CONCLUSION: Mutations in pfkelch13 and
      the six background genes may not play an important role in the in vivo selection 
      after artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Uganda. Different mechanisms might
      rather be associated with the existence of parasites after treatment.

PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1669-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopy and rapid diagnosis tests have a limited sensitivity in
      diagnosis of malaria by Plasmodium ovale. The LAMP kit (LoopAMP(R)) can be used
      in the field without special equipment and could have an important role in
      malaria control programmes in endemic areas and for malaria diagnosis in returned
      travellers. The performance of the Pan primer of the kit in detecting malaria by 
      P. ovale was compared with the results of standard nPCR in samples of patients
      returning from P. ovale endemic areas. METHODS: Plasmodium ovale positive samples
      (29, tested by PCR and/or microscopy) and malaria negative specimens (398, tested
      by microscopy and PCR) were collected in different hospitals of Europe from June 
      2014 to March 2016 and frozen at -20 degrees C. Boil and spin method was used to 
      extract DNA from all samples and amplification was performed with LoopAMP(R)
      MALARIA kit (Eiken Chemical, Japan) in an automated turbidimeter (Eiken 500). The
      results of LAMP read by turbidimetry and with the naked eye were compared.
      RESULTS: The kit showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.24% with
      positive and negative predictive values of 72.5 and 100%, respectively. Naked
      eyed readings were in accordance with turbidimetry readings (sensitivity, 92.5%, 
      specificity, 98.96% and positive and negative predictive values, respectively,
      90.24 and 99.22%). The limit of detection of LAMP assay for P. ovale was between 
      0.8 and 2 parasites/microl. CONCLUSIONS: The Pan primer of the Malaria kit
      LoopAMP(R) can detect P. ovale at very low-levels and showed a predictive
      negative value of 100%. This tool can be useful in malaria control and
      elimination programmes and in returned travellers from P. ovale endemic areas.
      Naked eye readings are equivalent to automated turbidimeter readings in specimens
      obtained with EDTA.

TI  - Malaria epidemiology in central Myanmar: identification of a multi-species
      asymptomatic reservoir of infection.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1651-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a global
      health concern. Myanmar stands at the frontier of artemisinin-resistant P.
      falciparum. Myanmar also has the highest reported malaria burden in Southeast
      Asia; it is integral in the World Health Organization's plan to eliminate malaria
      in Southeast Asia, yet few epidemiological data exist for the general population 
      in Myanmar. METHODS: This cross-sectional, probability household survey was
      conducted in Phyu township, Bago Region (central Myanmar), during the wet season 
      of 2013. Interviewers collected clinical and behavioural data, recorded tympanic 
      temperature and obtained dried blood spots for malaria PCR and serology.
      Plasmodium falciparum positive samples were tested for genetic mutations in the
      K13 region that may confer artemisinin resistance. Estimated type-specific
      malaria PCR prevalence and seroprevalence were calculated, with regression
      analysis to identify risk factors for seropositivity to P. falciparum. Data were 
      weighted to account for unequal selection probabilities. RESULTS: 1638
      participants were sampled (500 households). Weighted PCR prevalence was low (n = 
      41, 2.5%) and most cases were afebrile (93%). Plasmodium falciparum was the most 
      common species (n = 19. 1.1%) and five (26%) P. falciparum samples harboured K13 
      mutations. Plasmodium knowlesi was detected in 1.0% (n = 16) and Plasmodium vivax
      was detected in 0.4% (n = 7). Seroprevalence was 9.4% for P. falciparum and 3.1% 
      for P. vivax. Seroconversion to P. falciparum was 0.003/year in the whole
      population, but 16-fold higher in men over 23 years old (LR test p = 0.016).
      DISCUSSION: This is the first population-based seroprevalence study from central 
      Myanmar. Low overall prevalence was discovered. However, these data suggest
      endemic transmission continues, probably associated with behavioural risk factors
      amongst working-age men. Genetic mutations associated with P. falciparum
      artemisinin resistance, the presence of P. knowlesi and discrete demographic risk
      groups present opportunities and challenges for malaria control. Responses
      targeted to working-age men, capable of detecting sub-clinical infections, and
      considering all species will facilitate malaria elimination in this setting.

TI  - Genetic clustering and polymorphism of the merozoite surface protein-3 of
      Plasmodium knowlesi clinical isolates from Peninsular Malaysia.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1935-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been reported to 
      cause significant numbers of human infection in South East Asia. Its merozoite
      surface protein-3 (MSP3) is a protein that belongs to a multi-gene family of
      proteins first found in Plasmodium falciparum. Several studies have evaluated the
      potential of P. falciparum MSP3 as a potential vaccine candidate. However, to
      date no detailed studies have been carried out on P. knowlesi MSP3 gene (pkmsp3).
      The present study investigates the genetic diversity, and haplotypes groups of
      pkmsp3 in P. knowlesi clinical samples from Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: Blood
      samples were collected from P. knowlesi malaria patients within a period of 4
      years (2008-2012). The pkmsp3 gene of the isolates was amplified via PCR, and
      subsequently cloned and sequenced. The full length pkmsp3 sequence was divided
      into Domain A and Domain B. Natural selection, genetic diversity, and haplotypes 
      of pkmsp3 were analysed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programmes. RESULTS:
      From 23 samples, 48 pkmsp3 sequences were successfully obtained. At the
      nucleotide level, 101 synonymous and 238 non-synonymous mutations were observed. 
      Tests of neutrality were not significant for the full length, Domain A or Domain 
      B sequences. However, the dN/dS ratio of Domain B indicates purifying selection
      for this domain. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed 42
      different haplotypes. Neighbour Joining phylogenetic tree and haplotype network
      analyses revealed that the haplotypes clustered into two distinct groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: A moderate level of genetic diversity was observed in the pkmsp3 and
      only the C-terminal region (Domain B) appeared to be under purifying selection.
      The separation of the pkmsp3 into two haplotype groups provides further evidence 
      of the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi types or lineages. Future studies
      should investigate the diversity of pkmsp3 among P. knowlesi isolates in North
      Borneo, where large numbers of human knowlesi malaria infection still occur.

TI  - Evidence of non-Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection in Kedougou, Senegal.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1661-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanded malaria control efforts in Senegal have resulted in
      increased use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) to identify the primary
      disease-causing Plasmodium species, Plasmodium falciparum. However, the type of
      RDT utilized in Senegal does not detect other malaria-causing species such as
      Plasmodium ovale spp., Plasmodium malariae, or Plasmodium vivax. Consequently,
      there is a lack of information about the frequency and types of malaria
      infections occurring in Senegal. This study set out to better determine whether
      species other than P. falciparum were evident among patients evaluated for
      possible malaria infection in Kedougou, Senegal. METHODS: Real-time polymerase
      chain reaction speciation assays for P. vivax, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae
      were developed and validated by sequencing and DNA extracted from 475 Plasmodium 
      falciparum-specific HRP2-based RDT collected between 2013 and 2014 from a
      facility-based sample of symptomatic patients from two health clinics in
      Kedougou, a hyper-endemic region in southeastern Senegal, were analysed. RESULTS:
      Plasmodium malariae (n = 3) and P. ovale wallikeri (n = 2) were observed as
      co-infections with P. falciparum among patients with positive RDT results (n =
      187), including one patient positive for all three species. Among 288 negative
      RDT samples, samples positive for P. falciparum (n = 24), P. ovale curtisi (n =
      3), P. ovale wallikeri (n = 1), and P. malariae (n = 3) were identified,
      corresponding to a non-falciparum positivity rate of 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings emphasize the limitations of the RDT used for malaria diagnosis and
      demonstrate that non-P. falciparum malaria infections occur in Senegal. Current
      RDT used for routine clinical diagnosis do not necessarily provide an accurate
      reflection of malaria transmission in Kedougou, Senegal, and more sensitive and
      specific methods are required for diagnosis and patient care, as well as
      surveillance and elimination activities. These findings have implications for
      other malaria endemic settings where species besides P. falciparum may be
      transmitted and overlooked by control or elimination activities.

      Isolates of Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 624-629
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0668 [doi]
AB  - AbstractPiperaquine combined with dihydroartemisinin is one of the artemisinin
      derivative combination therapies, which can replace artesunate-mefloquine in
      treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand. The aim of this study was 
      to determine the in vitro sensitivity of Thai Plasmodium falciparum isolates
      against piperaquine and the influence of the pfmdr1 gene on in vitro response.
      One hundred and thirty-seven standard laboratory and adapted Thai isolates of P. 
      falciparum were assessed for in vitro piperaquine sensitivity. Polymorphisms of
      the pfmdr1 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction methods. The mean
      and standard deviation of the piperaquine IC50 in Thai isolates of P. falciparum 
      were 16.7 +/- 6.3 nM. The parasites exhibiting chloroquine IC50 of >/= 100 nM
      were significantly less sensitive to piperaquine compared with the parasite with 
      chloroquine IC50 of < 100 nM. No significant association between the pfmdr1 copy 
      number and piperaquine IC50 values was found. In contrast, the parasites
      containing the pfmdr1 86Y allele exhibited significantly reduced piperaquine
      sensitivity. Before nationwide implementation of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      as the first-line treatment in Thailand, in vitro and in vivo evaluations of this
      combination should be performed especially in areas where parasites containing
      the pfmdr1 86Y allele are predominant such as the Thai-Malaysian border.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artesunate-mefloquine therapy for treating uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria: systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trw077 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study is a systematic review of the literature on the
      efficacy and safety of the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      infections with artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) compared to other artemisinin-based 
      combination therapies (ACTs), designed to assist decision makers in Brazil.
      METHODS: Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected in four
      electronic databases and in complementary sources. Meta-analyses were performed
      to evaluate the efficacy expressed by relative risks (RR) obtained from treatment
      failure confirmed by the PCR. RESULTS: Due primarily to the presence of
      measurement bias in the selected studies, the quality of the evidence was
      considered predominantly moderate. Statistically significant associations were
      not observed when ASMQ was compared to artemether-lumefentrine and
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The results of studies performed in areas with a 
      history of use of ASMQ, regardless of the intensity of transmission, were not
      statistically different from those presented in the meta-analyses. For
      comparisons with artesunate-amodiaquine and artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine,
      the results were favourable to ASMQ. No deaths were attributed to ASMQ, severe
      adverse events were rare and some studies indicate a higher frequency of mild
      adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ASMQ it is recommended to Brazil as first
      line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum Nucleosomes Exhibit Reduced Stability and Lost Sequence
      Dependent Nucleosome Positioning.
PG  - e1006080
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006080 [doi]
AB  - The packaging and organization of genomic DNA into chromatin represents an
      additional regulatory layer of gene expression, with specific nucleosome
      positions that restrict the accessibility of regulatory DNA elements. The
      mechanisms that position nucleosomes in vivo are thought to depend on the
      biophysical properties of the histones, sequence patterns, like phased
      di-nucleotide repeats and the architecture of the histone octamer that folds DNA 
      in 1.65 tight turns. Comparative studies of human and P. falciparum histones
      reveal that the latter have a strongly reduced ability to recognize internal
      sequence dependent nucleosome positioning signals. In contrast, the nucleosomes
      are positioned by AT-repeat sequences flanking nucleosomes in vivo and in vitro. 
      Further, the strong sequence variations in the plasmodium histones, compared to
      other mammalian histones, do not present adaptations to its AT-rich genome. Human
      and parasite histones bind with higher affinity to GC-rich DNA and with lower
      affinity to AT-rich DNA. However, the plasmodium nucleosomes are overall less
      stable, with increased temperature induced mobility, decreased salt stability of 
      the histones H2A and H2B and considerable reduced binding affinity to GC-rich
      DNA, as compared with the human nucleosomes. In addition, we show that plasmodium
      histone octamers form the shortest known nucleosome repeat length (155bp) in
      vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the biochemical properties of the
      parasite histones are distinct from the typical characteristics of other
      eukaryotic histones and these properties reflect the increased accessibility of
      the P. falciparum genome.

TI  - Using Respondent Driven Sampling to Identify Malaria Risks and Occupational
      Networks among Migrant Workers in Ranong, Thailand.
PG  - e0168371
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ranong Province in southern Thailand is one of the primary entry
      points for migrants entering Thailand from Myanmar, and borders Kawthaung
      Township in Myanmar where artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites has been
      detected. Areas of high population movement could increase the risk of spread of 
      artemisinin resistance in this region and beyond. METHODS: A respondent-driven
      sampling (RDS) methodology was used to compare migrant populations coming from
      Myanmar in urban (Site 1) vs. rural (Site 2) settings in Ranong, Thailand. The
      RDS methodology collected information on knowledge, attitudes, and practices for 
      malaria, travel and occupational histories, as well as social network size and
      structure. Individuals enrolled were screened for malaria by microscopy, Real
      Time-PCR, and serology. RESULTS: A total of 619 participants were recruited in
      Ranong City and 623 participants in Kraburi, a rural sub-district. By PCR, a
      total of 14 (1.1%) samples were positive (2 P. falciparum in Site 1; 10 P. vivax,
      1 Pf, and 1 P. malariae in Site 2). PCR analysis demonstrated an overall weighted
      prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI, 0-1.3%) in the urban site and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5-1.7%)
      in the rural site for all parasite species. PCR positivity did not correlate with
      serological positivity; however, as expected there was a strong association
      between antibody prevalence and both age and exposure. Access to long-lasting
      insecticidal treated nets remains low despite relatively high reported
      traditional net use among these populations. CONCLUSIONS: The low malaria
      prevalence, relatively smaller networks among migrants in rural settings, and
      limited frequency of travel to and from other areas of malaria transmission in
      Myanmar, suggest that the risk for the spread of artemisinin resistance from this
      area may be limited in these networks currently but may have implications for
      regional malaria elimination efforts.

TI  - Placental weight ratio affects placental mRNA expression of insulin-like growth
      factor-I and long isoform of the leptin receptor in Plasmodium falciparuminfected
      pregnant women.
PG  - S75-S82
LID - 10.6133/apjcn.122016.s12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is
      characterised by placental inefficiency caused by infected erythrocyte
      sequestration. Reduced placental efficiency leads to placental intrauterine
      adaptation for sustaining fetal growth, which is reflected by changes in the
      expression of placental genes involved in intrauterine growth regulation.
      Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the placental weight ratio, an indicator
      of placental efficiency, affects the placental expression of the components of
      the insulin-like growth factor axis and leptin signalling pathway in P.
      falciparum-infected pregnant women. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A malaria case-only
      analysis of 50 P. falciparum-infected pregnant women in Timika, Papua, Indonesia,
      was conducted. The placental mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-I,
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, leptin, and the long and short
      isoforms of the leptin receptor was measured through quantitative realtime PCR.
      RESULTS: The placental weight ratio exerted a positive effect on the placental
      mRNA expression of insulin- like growth factor-I (coefficient=6.10, p=0.002) and 
      the long isoform of the leptin receptor (coefficient= 4.73, p=0.015) in
      malaria-infected pregnant women without fever or chill symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results indicate that placental adaptive responses caused by adverse intrauterine
      conditions in P. falciparuminfected pregnant women vary depending on the presence
      or absence of fever and chill symptoms.

      from symptomatic malaria patients in Burkina Faso.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in western
      Cambodia is threatening to revert the recent advances made toward global malaria 
      control and elimination. Known resistance-mediating polymorphisms in the K13,
      pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes are of greatest importance for monitoring
      the spread of antimalarial drug resistance. METHODS: Samples for the present
      study were collected from 244 patients with uncomplicated malaria in health
      centers of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Blood sample was collected on filter
      paper before the subject received any treatment. The parasite DNA was then
      extracted and amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to evaluate the
      prevalence of polymorphism of pfcrtK76T, pfmdr1 (N86Y, Y184F), and pfdhps (A437G,
      K540E). The K13 gene polymorphism was analyzed by nested PCR followed by
      sequencing. RESULTS: The overall results showed 2.26% (5/221) of K13 synonymous
      mutant alleles (two C469C, one Y493Y, one G496G, and one V589V), 24.78%, 19.58%, 
      68.75%, 60.9%, 53.7%, 63.8%, and 64.28%, respectively, for mutant pfcrt 76T,
      pfmdr1-86Y, pfmdr1-184F, pfdhfr51I, pfdhfr59R, pfdhfr108N, and pfdhps 437G. We
      did not report any mutation at codon 540 of pfdhps. CONCLUSION: These results
      provide baseline prevalence of known drug resistance polymorphisms and suggest
      that artemisinin combination therapies may retain good efficacy in the treatment 
      of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.

AB  - Accurate quantification of parasite density in the human host is essential for
      understanding the biology and pathology of malaria. Semi-quantitative molecular
      methods are widely applied, but the need for an external standard curve makes it 
      difficult to compare parasite density estimates across studies. Droplet digital
      PCR (ddPCR) allows direct quantification without the need for a standard curve.
      ddPCR was used to diagnose and quantify P. falciparum and P. vivax in clinical
      patients as well as in asymptomatic samples. ddPCR yielded highly reproducible
      measurements across the range of parasite densities observed in humans, and
      showed higher sensitivity than qPCR to diagnose P. falciparum, and equal
      sensitivity for P. vivax. Correspondence in quantification was very high (>0.95) 
      between qPCR and ddPCR. Quantification between technical replicates by ddPCR
      differed 1.5-1.7-fold, compared to 2.4-6.2-fold by qPCR. ddPCR facilitates
      parasite quantification for studies where absolute densities are required, and
      will increase comparability of results reported from different laboratories.

TI  - Molecular Evidence of High Proportion of Plasmodium vivax Malaria Infection in
      White Nile Area in Sudan.
PG  - 2892371
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is a predominant malaria species that infects humans in the
      African continent. A recent WHO report estimated 95% and 5% of P. falciparum and 
      P. vivax malaria cases, respectively, in Sudan. However many laboratory reports
      from different areas in Sudan indicated otherwise. In order to verify, we
      selected four hundred suspected malaria cases from Aljabalain area located in the
      White Nile state, central Sudan, and diagnosed them with quality insured
      microscopy and species-specific nested PCR. Our results indicated that the
      proportion of P. vivax infections among suspected malaria cases was high. We
      found that on average 20% and 36.5% of malaria infections in both study areas
      were caused by P. vivax using both microscopy and PCR, respectively. This change 
      in pattern is likely due to the recent demographic changes and high rate of
      immigration from neighbouring countries in the recent years. This is the first
      extensive clinical study of its kind that shows rising trend in P. vivax malaria 
      cases in White Nile area, Sudan.

TI  - Safety, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of Prime-Boost Vaccination with ChAd63 and
      MVA Encoding ME-TRAP against Plasmodium falciparum Infection in Adults in
      Senegal.

AB  - Malaria transmission is in decline in some parts of Africa, partly due to the
      scaling up of control measures. If the goal of elimination is to be achieved,
      additional control measures including an effective and durable vaccine will be
      required. Studies utilising the prime-boost approach to deliver viral vectors
      encoding the pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope
      thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) have shown promising safety,
      immunogenicity and efficacy in sporozoite challenge studies. More recently, a
      study in Kenyan adults, similar to that reported here, showed substantial
      efficacy against P. falciparum infection. One hundred and twenty healthy male
      volunteers, living in a malaria endemic area of Senegal were randomised to
      receive either the Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) ME-TRAP as prime vaccination,
      followed eight weeks later by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) also encoding
      ME-TRAP as booster, or two doses of anti-rabies vaccine as a comparator. Prior to
      follow-up, antimalarials were administered to clear parasitaemia and then
      participants were monitored by PCR for malaria infection for eight weeks. The
      primary endpoint was time-to-infection with P. falciparum malaria, determined by 
      two consecutive positive PCR results. Secondary endpoints included adverse event 
      reporting, measures of cellular and humoral immunogenicity and a meta-analysis of
      combined vaccine efficacy with the parallel study in Kenyan adults.We show that
      this pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine is safe and induces significant
      immunogenicity, with a peak T-cell response at seven days after boosting of 932
      Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/106 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMC) compared to
      57 SFC/ 106 PBMCs in the control group. However, a vaccine efficacy was not
      observed: 12 of 57 ME-TRAP vaccinees became PCR positive during the intensive
      monitoring period as compared to 13 of the 58 controls (P = 0.80). This trial
      confirms that vaccine efficacy against malaria infection in adults may be rapidly
      assessed using this efficient and cost-effective clinical trial design. Further
      efficacy evaluation of this vectored candidate vaccine approach in other malaria 
      transmission settings and age-de-escalation into the main target age groups for a
      malaria vaccine is in progress.

TI  - Evaluation of the Parasight Platform for Malaria Diagnosis.
PG  - 768-775
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02155-16 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500 million malaria tests are
      performed annually. While microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the
      main diagnostic approaches, no single method is inexpensive, rapid, and highly
      accurate. Two recent studies from our group have demonstrated a prototype
      computer vision platform that meets those needs. Here we present the results from
      two clinical studies on the commercially available version of this technology,
      the Sight Diagnostics Parasight platform, which provides malaria diagnosis,
      species identification, and parasite quantification. We conducted a multisite
      trial in Chennai, India (Apollo Hospital [n = 205]), and Nairobi, Kenya (Aga Khan
      University Hospital [n = 263]), in which we compared the device to microscopy,
      RDTs, and PCR. For identification of malaria, the device performed similarly well
      in both contexts (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 100% at the Indian site
      and sensitivity of 99.3% and specificity of 98.9% at the Kenyan site, compared to
      PCR). For species identification, the device correctly identified 100% of samples
      with Plasmodium vivax and 100% of samples with Plasmodium falciparum in India and
      100% of samples with P. vivax and 96.1% of samples with P. falciparum in Kenya,
      compared to PCR. Lastly, comparisons of the device parasite counts with those of 
      trained microscopists produced average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84
      at the Indian site and 0.85 at the Kenyan site.

AB  - Treatment choice for patients with malaria in Israeli hospitals is based on
      microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Here, we demonstrate the cumulative
      value of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in optimizing the treatment of
      malaria. Between January 2009 and December 2015, 451 samples from 357 patients
      were tested in our laboratory using a real-time PCR assay. Hospital laboratory
      results (without real-time PCR) were compared to those obtained in our
      laboratory. A total of 307 patients had a malaria-positive laboratory finding in 
      the hospital. Out of those, 288 were confirmed positive and 19 negative using
      real-time PCR. Two negative hospital results were found to be positive by
      real-time PCR. More specifically, of 153 cases positive for Plasmodium falciparum
      by real-time PCR, only 138 (90%) had been correctly identified at the hospitals. 
      Similarly, 66 (67%) of 99 cases positive for P. vivax, 2 (11%) of 18 cases
      positive for P. ovale, and 3 (30%) of 10 cases positive for P. malariae had been 
      correctly identified. Of 10 cases of mixed infection, only one had been
      identified as such at the hospital. Thus, real-time PCR was required for correct 
      identification in 81 (28%) out of 290 positive cases. In 52 (18%) of those, there
      was an erroneous categorization of relapsing versus non-relapsing parasites. In a
      nationwide study, we found that the use of real-time PCR is definitely beneficial
      and may change the decision regarding the choice of treatment.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum genotype and gametocyte prevalence in children with
      uncomplicated malaria in coastal Ghana.
PG  - 592
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are vital to sustaining malaria
      transmission. Parasite densities, multiplicity of infection as well as asexual
      genotype are features that have been found to influence gametocyte production.
      Measurements of the prevalence of Plasmodium sp. gametocytes may serve as a tool 
      to monitor the success of malaria eradication efforts. METHODS: Whole blood was
      collected from 112 children aged between 6 months and 13 years with uncomplicated
      P. falciparum malaria attending three health facilities in southern Ghana from
      June to August, 2014 before (day 0) and 4 days after completion of anti-malaria
      drug treatment (day 7). Malaria parasites were observed by microscopy and
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR); submicroscopic gametocyte carriage was measured 
      by a Pfs25 (PF3D7_1031000) mRNA real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR). Parasite genotyping was performed on gDNA extracted from dried
      filter paper blood blots by amplification of the polymorphic regions of msp1
      (PF3D7_0930300) and msp2 (PF3D7_0206800) using PCR. RESULTS: Microscopy estimated
      3.1% (3/96) of the total population to carry gametocytes on day 0, which
      decreased to 2.1% (2/96) on day 7. In contrast, reverse transcriptase-real time
      PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of a subset of 35 samples estimated submicroscopic
      gametocyte carriage to be as high as 77% (27/35) using primers specific for Pfs25
      (CT < 35) on day 0 and by day 7 this only declined to 60% (21/35). Genotyping the
      msp2 gene identified higher levels of MOI than the msp1 gene. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although below detection by microscopy, gametocyte prevalence at submicroscopic
      levels are high in this region and emphasize the need for more effective
      elimination approaches like the development of transmission-blocking vaccines and
      safer gametocytocidal drugs.

AB  - The nested PCR was used to estimate its inputs in malaria diagnosis and in the
      performance of the microscope operators involved in the surveillance of malaria
      in remote areas of South Algeria. For the period 2010 to 2015, 112 patients (93
      febrile and 19 asymptomatic) coming from sub-Saharan Africa were tested for
      malaria in the hospital of Tamanrasset. One part of the blood taken from
      fingertip was used for blood smears and the second part was absorbed in filter
      paper for molecular diagnosis. Overall, the infection was detected by nested PCR 
      in 63 samples versus 53 by direct examination. In addition, 11 mixed infections
      and 6 positive asymptomatic cases not detected by microscopy were diagnosed by
      PCR. Moreover, two negative samples in nested PCR were tested positive by direct 
      examination. The molecular tool is more sensitive than the direct examination in 
      detecting infra-microscopic parasitaemia and mixed infections...

TI  - CR1 exon variants are associated with lowered CR1 expression and increased
      susceptibility to SLE in a Plasmodium falciparum endemic population.
PG  - e000145
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays an important role in immune complex
      clearance by opsonisation and possibly protects subjects from development of
      autoantibodies. Lower CR1 expression has been associated with susceptibility to
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In contrast, subjects displaying lower CR1
      expression are protected against severe manifestations of falciparum malaria.
      This study is the first of its kind to investigate the association of CR1
      variants with development of SLE in a P. falciparum endemic population from
      Odisha, India. METHODS: CR1 polymorphisms (intron 27 (A>T), exon 22 (A>G) and
      exon 33 (G>C)) were typed by PCR and restriction length polymorphism in 297 cases
      of female patients with SLE and 300 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls 
      from malaria endemic areas in Odisha, India. CR1 expression on monocytes was
      quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The homozygous mutants of CR1 exon 22 (GG)
      and exon 33 (GG) and their minor alleles were associated with susceptibility to
      SLE. Furthermore, patients with SLE who harboured the GG genotype of the exon 33 
      polymorphism had a 3.12-fold higher chance of developing lupus nephritis. CR1
      exon (22 and 33) variants were associated with lowered CR1 expression on
      monocytes in patients with SLE and in healthy controls. Patients with lupus
      nephritis showed significantly diminished CR1 expression than those without renal
      involvement (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate
      that common CR1 exon variants are associated with diminished CR1 expression on
      monocytes and increased susceptibility to development of SLE and lupus nephritis 
      in a malaria endemic area.

TI  - Targeting Neutrophils to Prevent Malaria-Associated Acute Lung Injury/Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Mice.
PG  - e1006054
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006054 [doi]
AB  - Malaria remains one of the greatest burdens to global health, causing nearly
      500,000 deaths in 2014. When manifesting in the lungs, severe malaria causes
      acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). We have
      previously shown that a proportion of DBA/2 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei
      ANKA (PbA) develop ALI/ARDS and that these mice recapitulate various aspects of
      the human syndrome, such as pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, pleural effusion and
      hypoxemia. Herein, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of
      malaria-associated ALI/ARDS. Mice developing ALI/ARDS showed greater neutrophil
      accumulation in the lungs compared with mice that did not develop pulmonary
      complications. In addition, mice with ALI/ARDS produced more
      neutrophil-attracting chemokines, myeloperoxidase and reactive oxygen species. We
      also observed that the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and PbA induced the
      formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) ex vivo, which were associated
      with inflammation and tissue injury. The depletion of neutrophils, treatment with
      AMD3100 (a CXCR4 antagonist), Pulmozyme (human recombinant DNase) or Sivelestat
      (inhibitor of neutrophil elastase) decreased the development of
      malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and significantly increased mouse survival. This
      study implicates neutrophils and NETs in the genesis of experimentally induced
      malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and proposes a new therapeutic approach to improve
      the prognosis of severe malaria.

TI  - Population genomics diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria patients
      attending Okelele Health Centre, Okelele, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria.
PG  - 704-711
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous malaria parasite species to
      humans remains an important public health concern in Okelele, a rural community
      in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. There is however little information about the
      genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: To determine
      the population genomic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria patients
      attending Okelele Community Healthcare Centre, Okelele, Ilorin, Kwara State.
      METHODS: In this study, 50 Plasmodium falciparum strains Merozoite Surface
      Protein 1, Merozoite Surface Protein 2 and Glutamate Rich Protein were analysed
      from Okelele Health Centre, Okelele, Ilorin, Nigeria. Genetic diversity of P.
      falciparum isolates were analysed from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of
      the MSP-1 (K1, MAD 20 and RO33), MSP-2 (FC27 and 3D7) and Glutamate Rich Protein 
      allelic families respectively. RESULTS: Polyclonal infections were more in
      majority of the patients for MSP-1 allelic families while monoclonal infections
      were more for MSP-2 allelic families. Multiplicity of infection for MSP-1, MSP-2 
      and GLURP were 1.7, 1.8 and 2.05 respectively. CONCLUSION: There is high genetic 
      diversity in MSP - 2 and GLURP allelic families of Plasmodium falciparum isolates
      from Okelele Health Centre, Ilorin, Nigeria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An unceasing threat of drug resistance continuously poses demand for 
      new antimalarial drugs. A scientific assessment of traditionally used
      antimalarial plants through reverse pharmacology is crucial for a fast track drug
      discovery. An Ayurvedic plant Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn. - (Parijat) is being
      used in clinical practice and had shown antimalarial activity, with a parasite
      clearance in 76.6% of 120 patients, in an earlier clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To
      further explore antimalarial potential of the plant through additional objective 
      markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open-labelled observational study was
      conducted at M.A. Podar Hospital - Ayurveda (MAPH-A) after ethics committee
      approval. Administration of a paste of 5 fresh leaves, thrice a day for a week
      was a standard practice for management of malaria at MAPH-A. Clinical activity of
      N. arbor-tristis was evaluated by monitoring pyrexia, parasitemia and morbidity
      score (MS) in twenty patients. In addition, immune and biochemical markers and
      organ functions were monitored for objective markers of response. Student's
      paired-'t' test was applied to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Ten out 
      of 20 patients showed both fever and parasite clearance, which was confirmed by
      polymerase chain reaction. Remaining ten patients had persistent but decreasing
      parasitemia. Four of them needed chloroquine as a fail-safe procedure.
      Irrespective of the degree of parasitemia all the patients showed decrease in MS.
      There was also an increase in platelet count and normalization of plasma lactic
      acid. There was a good clinical tolerability and an improvement in organ
      function. The inflammatory cytokines showed a reduction; particularly in
      TNF-alpha within a day. CONCLUSIONS: At the given dosage, N. arbor-tristis showed
      disease-modifying activity; early clinical recovery with a decline of TNF-alpha
      and a gradual parasite clearance. Further studies with a standardised formulation
      for dose-searching and optimizing the treatment schedule are needed in a larger
      sample size. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NO: The process of trial registration
      had not begun when the study was conducted in 2000.

TI  - In Vitro Variant Surface Antigen Expression in Plasmodium falciparum Parasites
      from a Semi-Immune Individual Is Not Correlated with Var Gene Transcription.
PG  - e0166135
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0166135 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is considered to be
      the main variant surface antigen (VSA) of Plasmodium falciparum and is mainly
      localized on electron-dense knobs in the membrane of the infected erythrocyte.
      Switches in PfEMP1 expression provide the basis for antigenic variation and are
      thought to be critical for parasite persistence during chronic infections.
      Recently, strain transcending anti-PfEMP1 immunity has been shown to develop
      early in life, challenging the role of PfEMP1 in antigenic variation during
      chronic infections. In this work we investigate how P. falciparum achieves
      persistence during a chronic asymptomatic infection. The infected individual
      (MOA) was parasitemic for 42 days and multilocus var gene genotyping showed
      persistence of the same parasite population throughout the infection. Parasites
      from the beginning of the infection were adapted to tissue culture and cloned by 
      limiting dilution. Flow cytometry using convalescent serum detected a variable
      surface recognition signal on isogenic clonal parasites. Quantitative real-time
      PCR with a field isolate specific var gene primer set showed that the surface
      recognition signal was not correlated with transcription of individual var genes.
      Strain transcending anti-PfEMP1 immunity of the convalescent serum was
      demonstrated with CD36 selected and PfEMP1 knock-down NF54 clones. In contrast,
      knock-down of PfEMP1 did not have an effect on the antibody recognition signal in
      MOA clones. Trypsinisation of the membrane surface proteins abolished the surface
      recognition signal and immune electron microscopy revealed that antibodies from
      the convalescent serum bound to membrane areas without knobs and with knobs.
      Together the data indicate that PfEMP1 is not the main variable surface antigen
      during a chronic infection and suggest a role for trypsin sensitive non-PfEMP1
      VSAs for parasite persistence in chronic infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malaria is an important tropical disease that is detected in 198
      million people and causes 367-755 thousand deaths annually. Recently, the
      real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique has enabled quick
      determination of Plasmodium spp. and species identification in the same assay
      with a low contamination risk. In the present study, we aimed to use real-time
      PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene to diagnose Plasmodium spp. and perform species
      identification. METHODS: DNA samples of 15 patients with malaria (14 caused by P.
      vivax, 1 caused by P. falciparum) confirmed by microscopy as well as positive
      control plasmids were used. As the negative control, DNA samples of 15
      individuals without malaria were used. RESULTS: According to the results of
      real-time PCR, samples of 15 patients with malaria were found to be positive for 
      Plasmodium spp. Melting curve analysis showed that 14 of them were P. vivax and
      the remaining was P. falciparum. In addition, mixed infection with P. falciparum 
      and P. vivax was successfully detected by real-time PCR when DNA of P.
      falciparum- and P. vivax-positive samples was experimentally mixed. CONCLUSION:
      The present study showed that real-time PCR can be useful in the diagnosis and
      species identification of Plasmodium spp. as well as the detection of mixed
      infections in addition to microscopy in Turkey.

TI  - The Utility of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests as a Tool in Enhanced Surveillance 
      for Malaria Elimination in Vanuatu.
PG  - e0167136
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0167136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As part of efforts to eliminate malaria, Vanuatu has piloted the
      implementation of enhanced malaria surveillance and response strategies since
      2011. This involves passive case detection (PCD) in health facilities, proactive 
      case detection (Pro-ACD) and reactive case detection (Re-ACD) in communities
      using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). While RDTs improve case management, 
      their utility for detection of malaria infections in ACDs in this setting is
      unclear. METHODS: The utility of malaria RDTs as diagnostic tools was evaluated
      in PCD, in five rounds of Pro-ACDs and five rounds of Re-ACDs conducted in Tafea 
      and Torba Provinces between 2011 and 2014. The number of malaria infections
      detected by RDTs was compared to that detected by PCR from collected used-RDTs.
      RESULTS: PCD in Tafea Province (2013) showed a RDT-positive rate of 0.21% (2/939)
      and a PCR-positive rate of 0.44% (2/453), indicating less than 1% of suspected
      malaria cases in Tafea Province were due to malaria. In Pro-ACDs conducted in
      Tafea and Torba Provinces, RDT-positive rates in 2013 and 2014 were 0.14%
      (3/2145) and 0% (0/2823), respectively, while the corresponding PCR-positive
      rates were 0.72% (9/1242) and 0.79% (9/1141). PCR identified villages in both
      provinces appearing to be transmission foci with a small number of low-density
      infections, mainly P. falciparum infections. In five rounds of Re-ACD, RDTs did
      not identify any additional infections while PCR detected only one among 173
      subjects screened. CONCLUSIONS: PCD and Pro-ACDs demonstrate that both Tafea and 
      Torba Provinces in Vanuatu has achieved very low malaria prevalence. In these
      low-transmission areas, conducting Pro-ACD and Re-ACDs using RDTs appears not
      cost-effective and may have limited impact on interrupting malaria transmission
      due to the small number of infections identified by RDTs and considerable
      operational resources invested. More sensitive, field deployable and affordable
      diagnostic tools will improve malaria surveillance in malaria elimination
      settings.

TI  - Plasmodium malariae in the Colombian Amazon region: you don't diagnose what you
      don't suspect.
PG  - 576
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a worldwide public health problem; parasites from the
      genus Plasmodium spp. are the aetiological agent of this disease. The parasite is
      mainly diagnosed by microscope-based techniques. However, these have limited
      sensitivity. Many asymptomatic infections are sub-microscopic and can only be
      detected by molecular methods. This study was aimed at comparing nested PCR
      results to those obtained by microscope for diagnosing malaria and to present
      epidemiological data regarding malaria in Colombia's Amazon department. METHODS: 
      A total of 1392 blood samples (taken by venepuncture) from symptomatic patients
      in Colombia's Amazon department were analysed in parallel by thick blood smear
      (TBS) test and nested PCR for determining Plasmodium spp. infection and
      identifying infecting species, such as Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae
      and/or Plasmodium falciparum. Descriptive statistics were used for comparing the 
      results from both tests regarding detection of the disease, typing infecting
      species and their prevalence in the study region. Bearing the microscope assay in
      mind as gold standard, PCR diagnosis performance was evaluated by statistical
      indicators. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed great differences between both
      diagnostic tests, as well as suggesting high P. malariae prevalence from a
      molecular perspective. This differed profoundly from previous studies in this
      region of Colombia, usually based on the TBS test, suggesting that diagnosis by
      conventional techniques could lead to underestimating the prevalence of certain
      Plasmodium spp. having high circulation in this area. The present results
      highlight the need for modifying state malaria surveillance schemes for more
      efficient strategies regarding the detection of this disease in endemic areas.
      The importance of PCR as a back-up test in cases of low parasitaemia or mixed
      infection is also highlighted.

TI  - Four artemisinin-based treatments in African pregnant women with malaria.
PG  - 139-149
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding the safety and efficacy of artemisinin
      combination treatments for malaria in pregnant women is limited, particularly
      among women who live in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, 
      randomized, open-label trial of treatments for malaria in pregnant women in four 
      African countries. A total of 3428 pregnant women in the second or third
      trimester who had falciparum malaria (at any parasite density and regardless of
      symptoms) were treated with artemether-lumefantrine, amodiaquine-artesunate,
      mefloquine-artesunate, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The primary end points 
      were the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-adjusted cure rates (i.e., cure of the
      original infection; new infections during follow-up were not considered to be
      treatment failures) at day 63 and safety outcomes. RESULTS: The PCR-adjusted cure
      rates in the per-protocol analysis were 94.8% in the artemether-lumefantrine
      group, 98.5% in the amodiaquine-artesunate group, 99.2% in the
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, and 96.8% in the mefloquine-artesunate
      group; the PCR-adjusted cure rates in the intention-to-treat analysis were 94.2%,
      96.9%, 98.0%, and 95.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference among 
      the amodiaquine-artesunate group, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, and the
      mefloquine-artesunate group. The cure rate in the artemether-lumefantrine group
      was significantly lower than that in the other three groups, although the
      absolute difference was within the 5-percentage-point margin for equivalence. The
      unadjusted cure rates, used as a measure of the post-treatment prophylactic
      effect, were significantly lower in the artemether-lumefantrine group (52.5%)
      than in groups that received amodiaquine-artesunate (82.3%),
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (86.9%), or mefloquine-artesunate (73.8%). No
      significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events and in birth
      outcomes was found among the treatment groups. Drug-related adverse events such
      as asthenia, poor appetite, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting occurred
      significantly more frequently in the mefloquine-artesunate group (50.6%) and the 
      amodiaquine-artesunate group (48.5%) than in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      group (20.6%) and the artemether-lumefantrine group (11.5%) (P<0.001 for
      comparison among the four groups). CONCLUSIONS: Artemether-lumefantrine was
      associated with the fewest adverse effects and with acceptable cure rates but
      provided the shortest posttreatment prophylaxis, whereas
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had the best efficacy and an acceptable safety
      profile. (Funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials
      Partnership and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00852423.).

TI  - Asymptomatic infections in blood donors harbouring Plasmodium: an invisible risk 
      detected by molecular and serological tools.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.2450/2016.0118-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted malaria due to asymptomatic Plasmodium
      infections is a challenge for blood banks. There is a lack of data on the
      prevalence of asymptomatic infected blood donors and the incidence of
      transfusion-transmitted malaria in low endemicity areas worldwide. We estimated
      the frequency of blood donors harbouring Plasmodium in an area in which
      asymptomatic infections have been reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To estimate the
      frequency of blood donors harbouring Plasmodium we used microscopy and molecular 
      tools. Serological tests were applied to measure the exposure of candidates to
      Plasmodium antigens. Venous blood was collected from 91 candidates attending the 
      "Pro-Sangue" Blood Centre Foundation in Sao Paulo, who lived in the municipality 
      of Juquitiba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where sporadic autochthonous cases of malaria
      have been described. Blood samples were used for parasitological, molecular and
      serological studies. RESULTS: Among the 91 samples examined, rare Plasmodium
      forms were observed in two donors. Genus real-time polymerase chain reaction
      analysis demonstrated Plasmodium amplification in three candidates and
      species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction identified P. malariae in two. 
      ELISA-IgG was reactive in 42.9% of samples for P. vivax (Pv-MSP119) and in 6.6%
      for P. falciparum (Pf-Zw). ELISA-IgM was reactive in 2.2% of samples for P. vivax
      and in 4.4% for P. falciparum. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was reactive 
      for P. malariae in 15.4% of cases. DISCUSSION: Reservoirs of Plasmodium represent
      a challenge for blood banks, since studies have shown that high levels of
      submicroscopic infections can occur in low transmission areas. The risk of
      transfusion-transmitted malaria presented here points to the need to conduct
      molecular investigations of candidate donors with any positive malarial antibody 
      test.

TI  - The hide and seek of Plasmodium vivax in West Africa: report from a large-scale
      study in Beninese asymptomatic subjects.
PG  - 570
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is considered to be absent from western Africa,
      where the prevalence of Duffy-negative red blood cell phenotype proves to be
      high. Several studies have, however, detected P. vivax infection cases in this
      part of Africa, raising the question of what is the actual prevalence of P. vivax
      in local populations. METHODS: The presence of P. vivax was investigated in a
      large population of healthy blood donors in Benin using microscopy, serology and 
      molecular detection. The seroprevalence was measured with species-specific ELISA 
      using two recombinant P. vivax proteins, namely rPvMSP1 and rPvCSP1. Specific
      molecular diagnosis of P. vivax infection was carried out using nested-PCR. The
      performances and cut-off values of both rPvCSP1 and rPvMSP1 ELISA were first
      assessed using sera from P. vivax-infected patients and from non-exposed
      subjects. RESULTS: Among 1234 Beninese blood donors, no parasites were detected
      when using microscopy, whereas 28.7% (354/1234) of patients exhibited had
      antibodies against rPvMSP1, 21.6% (266/1234) against rPvCSP1, and 15.2%
      (187/1234) against both. Eighty-four samples were selected for nested-PCR
      analyses, of which 13 were positive for P. vivax nested-PCR and all Duffy
      negative. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study highlight an unexpectedly 
      high exposure of Beninese subjects to P. vivax, resulting in sub-microscopic
      infections. This suggests a probably underestimated and insidious parasite
      presence in western Africa. While the vaccination campaigns and therapeutic
      efforts are all focused on Plasmodium falciparum, it is also essential to
      consider the epidemiological impact of P. vivax.

TI  - Oil-Fortified Maize Porridge Increases Absorption of Lumefantrine in Children
      with Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria.
PG  - 457-465
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12714 [doi]
AB  - Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
      Absorption of lumefantrine (LUM) is fat dependent, and in children, intake is
      recommended with milk. We investigated whether oil-fortified maize porridge can
      be an alternative when milk is not available. In an open-label pharmacokinetic
      study, Ugandan children <5 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      were randomized to receive standard six-dose AL treatment [one tablet (20 mgA/120
      mg LUM) if <15 kg and two tablets if >15 kg] with milk (A) or maize porridge plus
      oil (B). Parametric two-sample t-test was used to compare relative oral LUM
      bioavailability. The primary end-point was LUM exposure till 8 hr after the first
      dose (AUC0-8 hr ). Secondary outcome included day 7 concentrations (d7LUM ), LUM 
      exposure between days 7 and 28 (AUCd7-28 ) and day 28 PCR-adjusted
      parasitological response. Evaluable children (n = 33) included 16 in arm A and 17
      in arm B. The AUC0-8 hr was comparable between A and B [geometric mean (95% CI): 
      6.01 (3.26-11.1) versus 6.26 (4.5-8.43) hr*mug/mL, p = 0.9]. Less interindividual
      variability in AUC0-8 hr was observed in B (p = 0.01), but d7LUM and AUCd7-28
      were comparable. Children receiving two tablets had significantly higher exposure
      than those receiving one tablet [median d7LUM (505 versus 289 ng/mL, p = 0.02)
      and AUCd7-28 (108 versus 41 hr*mug/mL, p = 0.006)]. One parasitological failure
      (d28 recrudescence) was observed. Our findings suggest that oil-fortified maize
      porridge can be an alternative to milk in augmenting absorption of LUM. The lower
      LUM exposure observed in children dosed with one AL tablet needs further
      attention.

TI  - Estimation of the In Vivo MIC of Cipargamin in Uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum Malaria.
LID - e01940-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01940-16 [doi]
AB  - The MIC of an antimalarial drug for a particular infection is the drug level
      associated with a net parasite multiplication rate of one per asexual cycle. To
      ensure the cure of malaria, the MIC must be exceeded until all parasites have
      been eliminated. The development of highly sensitive and accurate PCR
      quantitation of low-density malaria parasitemia enables the prospective
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characterization of antimalarial drug
      effects and now allows identification of the in vivo MIC. An adaptive design and 
      a PK-PD modeling approach were used to determine prospectively the MIC of the new
      antimalarial cipargamin (KAE609) in adults with uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in an open-label, dose-ranging phase 2a study. Vietnamese
      adults with acute P. falciparum malaria were allocated sequentially to treatment 
      with a single 30-mg (n = 6), 20-mg (n = 5), 10-mg (n = 7), or 15-mg (n = 7) dose 
      of cipargamin. Artemisinin-based combination therapy was given after parasite
      densities had fallen and then risen as cipargamin levels declined below the MIC
      but before a return of signs or symptoms. The rates of parasite clearance were
      dose dependent, with near saturation of the effect being seen at an adult dose of
      30 mg. The developed PK-PD model accurately predicted the therapeutic responses
      in 23/25 patients. The predicted median in vivo MIC was 0.126 ng/ml (range, 0.038
      to 0.803 ng/ml). Pharmacometric characterization of the relationship between
      antimalarial drug concentrations and parasite clearance rates following graded
      subtherapeutic antimalarial drug dosing is safe and provides a rational framework
      for dose finding in antimalarial drug development. (This study has been
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT01836458.).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In a markedly seasonal malaria setting, the transition from the
      transmission-free dry season to the transmission season depends on the resurgence
      of the mosquito population following the start of annual rains. The sudden onset 
      of malaria outbreaks at the start of the transmission season suggests that
      parasites persist during the dry season and respond to either the reappearance of
      vectors, or correlated events, by increasing the production of transmission
      stages. Here, we investigate whether Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte density and
      the correlation between gametocyte density and parasite density show seasonal
      variation in chronic (largely asymptomatic) carriers in eastern Sudan. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We recruited and treated 123 malaria patients in the transmission
      season 2001. We then followed them monthly during four distinct consecutive
      epidemiological seasons: transmission season 1, transmission-free season,
      pre-clinical period, and transmission season 2. In samples collected from 25
      participants who fulfilled the selection criteria of the current analysis, we
      used quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RT-qPCR to quantify parasite and gametocyte
      densities, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed a significant
      increase in gametocyte density and a significantly steeper positive correlation
      between gametocyte density and total parasite density during the pre-clinical
      period compared to the preceding transmission-free season. However, there was no 
      corresponding increase in the density or prevalence of total parasites or
      gametocyte prevalence. The increase in gametocyte production during the
      pre-clinical period supports the hypothesis that P. falciparum may respond to
      environmental cues, such as mosquito biting, to modulate its transmission
      strategy. Thus, seasonal changes may be important to ignite transmission in
      unstable-malaria settings.

      Combination of Azithromycin-Chloroquine in Asymptomatic Pregnant Women with
      Plasmodium Falciparum Parasitemia: An Open-Label, Non-Comparative Study in
      Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the most important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in pregnant women and their newborn babies in sub-Saharan Africa.
      Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) is recommended by the World
      Health Organization (WHO) to reduce the burden of disease and improve maternal
      and neonatal survival and general health. Due to the growing resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), the current WHO-recommended drug for IPTp,
      identification of new and effective drugs is an urgent priority. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: This was an open-label, non-comparative study (NCT01103713) in 5
      countries in East and sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and
      Uganda) to assess parasitological response and drug concentrations of a single,
      3-day course of four tablets of a fixed-dose combination of
      azithromycin-chloroquine (AZCQ) 250/155 mg given during the second or third
      trimester to women with asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in their
      first or second pregnancy. Parasitemia was determined by microscopy and molecular
      genotyping was performed to characterize parasites relative to the baseline
      infection. Weekly follow-up visits took place until day 42 after first dose and
      additional follow-up occurred after delivery. Systemic concentrations of
      azithromycin (AZ), chloroquine (CQ), and the CQ metabolite, desethyl CQ (DECQ)
      were evaluated at Day 0 (pre-dose), at Day 2 (pre-dose, 2 and 8 hours) and
      randomly at Days 7 and 14. Systemic concentrations of CQ and DECQ were also
      measured randomly at Day 21 and Day 28. In total, 404 women were screened for
      eligibility and 168 were treated, 155 of whom completed the study. PCR-adjusted
      parasitological response in the modified intent-to-treat population at day 28
      (the primary efficacy endpoint) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method as
      99.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.76, 100.00). PCR-adjusted
      parasitological response remained high at day 42 (95.19%; 95% CI: 91.35, 99.03). 
      In general, the mean concentrations of serum AZ, plasma CQ, and plasma DECQ
      showed large CV% values (ranges of 33-156%, 42-228%, and 57-109%, respectively). 
      There were 157 live births, three stillbirths, and eight pregnancies of unknown
      outcome: 7 due to withdrawal of participant consent and 1 lost to follow-up. The 
      most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were vomiting (20.8%) and
      dizziness (19.6%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a 3-day course of AZCQ
      can lead to an adequate 28-day parasitological response.

TI  - Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale infections in the China-Myanmar border
      area.
PG  - 557
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Greater Mekong Subregion is aiming to achieve regional malaria
      elimination by 2030. Though a shift in malaria parasite species predominance by
      Plasmodium vivax has been recently documented, the transmission of the two minor 
      Plasmodium species, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp., is poorly
      characterized in the region. This study aims to determine the prevalence of these
      minor species in the China-Myanmar border area and their genetic diversity.
      METHODS: Epidemiology study was conducted during passive case detection in
      hospitals and clinics in Myanmar and four counties in China along the
      China-Myanmar border. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in villages and
      camps for internally displaced persons to determine the prevalence of malaria
      infections. Malaria infections were diagnosed initially by microscopy and later
      in the laboratory using nested PCR for the SSU rRNA genes. Plasmodium malariae
      and P. ovale infections were confirmed by sequencing the PCR products. The P.
      ovale subtypes were determined by sequencing the Pocytb, Pocox1 and Pog3p genes. 
      Parasite populations were evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of the
      MSP-1 genes. Antifolate sensitivity was assessed by sequencing the dhfr-ts and
      dhps genes from the P. malariae and P. ovale isolates. RESULTS: Analysis of 2701 
      blood samples collected from the China-Myanmar border by nested PCR targeting the
      parasite SSU rRNA genes identified 561 malaria cases, including 161 Plasmodium
      falciparum, 327 P. vivax, 66 P. falciparum/P. vivax mixed infections, 4 P.
      malariae and 3 P. ovale spp. P. vivax and P. falciparum accounted for >60 and
      ~30% of all malaria cases, respectively. In comparison, the prevalence of P.
      malariae and P. ovale spp. was very low and only made up ~1% of all PCR-positive 
      cases. Nevertheless, these two species were often misidentified as P. vivax
      infections or completely missed by microscopy even among symptomatic patients.
      Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rRNA, Pocytb, Pocox1 and Pog3p genes confirmed
      that the three P. ovale spp. isolates belonged to the subtype P. ovale curtisi.
      Low-level genetic diversity was detected in the MSP-1, dhfr and dhps genes of
      these minor parasite species, potentially stemming from the low prevalence of
      these parasites preventing their mixing. Whereas most of the dhfr and dhps
      positions equivalent to those conferring antifolate resistance in P. falciparum
      and P. vivax were wild type, a new mutation S113C corresponding to the S108
      position in pfdhfr was identified in two P. ovale curtisi isolates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The four human malaria parasite species all occurred sympatrically at the
      China-Myanmar border. While P. vivax has become the predominant species, the two 
      minor parasite species also occurred at very low prevalence but were often
      misidentified or missed by conventional microscopy. These minor parasite species 
      displayed low levels of polymorphisms in the msp-1, dhfr and dhps genes.

TI  - Low prevalence of laboratory-confirmed malaria in clinically diagnosed adult
      women from the Wakiso district of Uganda.
PG  - 555
AB  - BACKGROUND: The malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has fallen
      substantially. Nevertheless, malaria remains a serious health concern, and Uganda
      ranks third in SSA in total malaria burden. Epidemiological studies of adult
      malaria in Uganda are scarce and little is known about rates of malaria in
      non-pregnant adult women. This pilot study assessed malaria prevalence among
      adult women from Wakiso district, historically a highly malaria endemic region.
      METHODS: Adult women using public health services were screened for malaria, HIV 
      and pregnancy. A physician-selected subset of women presenting to the Outpatient 
      Department of Entebbe General Hospital (EGH) with current fever (axillary
      temperature >/=37.5 degrees C) or self-reporting fever during the previous 24 h, 
      and a positive thick smear for malaria in the EGH laboratory were enrolled (n =
      86). Women who self-identified as pregnant or HIV-positive were excluded from
      screening. Malaria infection was then assessed using HRP2/pLDH rapid diagnostic
      tests (RDTs) in all participants. Repeat microscopy and PCR were performed at a
      research laboratory for a subset of participants. In addition, 104 women without 
      a history of fever were assessed for asymptomatic parasitaemia using RDT, and a
      subset of these women screened for parasitaemia using microscopy (40 women) and
      PCR (40 women). RESULTS: Of 86 women diagnosed with malaria by EGH, only two
      (2.3%) had malaria confirmed using RDT, subsequently identified as a Plasmodium
      falciparum infection by research microscopy and PCR. Subset analysis of hospital 
      diagnosed RDT-negative participants detected one sub-microscopic infection with
      Plasmodium ovale. Compared to RDT, sensitivity, specificity and PPV of hospital
      microscopy were 100% (CI 19.8-100), 0% (CI 0-5.32) and 2.33% (CI 0.403-8.94)
      respectively. Compared to PCR, sensitivity, specificity and PPV of hospital
      microscopy were 100% (CI 31.0-100), 0% (CI 0-34.5) and 23.1% (CI 6.16-54.0),
      respectively. No malaria was detected among asymptomatic women using RDT,
      research microscopy or PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria prevalence among adult women
      appears to be low in Wakiso, but is masked by high rates of malaria
      overdiagnosis. More accurate malaria testing is urgently needed in public
      hospitals in this region to identify true causes of febrile illness and reduce
      unnecessary provision of anti-malarial therapy.

TI  - Asymptomatic only at first sight: malaria infection among schoolchildren in
      highland Rwanda.
PG  - 553
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium infection and malaria in school children are increasingly 
      recognized as a relevant public health problem, but data on actual prevalence and
      health consequences are insufficient. The present study from highland southern
      Rwanda aimed at estimating infection prevalence among children attending school, 
      at identifying associated factors and at assessing the clinical consequences of
      these infections. METHODS: In a survey including 12 schools in the Huye district 
      of Rwanda, 1089 children aged 6-10 years were clinically and anthropometrically
      examined, malaria parasites were diagnosed by microscopy and PCR, haemoglobin
      concentrations were measured, and socio-economic and behavioural parameters as
      well as medical histories were obtained. RESULTS: Upon examination, the vast
      majority of children was asymptomatic (fever 2.7%). Plasmodium infection was
      detected in 22.4% (Plasmodium falciparum, 18.8%); 41% of these were
      submicroscopic. Independent predictors of infection included low altitude, higher
      age, preceding antimalarial treatment, and absence of electricity or a bicycle in
      the household. Plasmodium infection was associated with anaemia (mean haemoglobin
      difference of -1.2 g/dL; 95% CI, -0.8 to -1.5 g/dL), fever, underweight,
      clinically assessed malnutrition and histories of fever, tiredness, weakness,
      poor appetite, abdominal pain, and vomiting. With the exception of underweight,
      these conditions were also increased at submicroscopic infection. CONCLUSION:
      Malaria infection is frequent among children attending school in southern
      highland Rwanda. Although seemingly asymptomatic in the vast majority of cases,
      infection is associated with a number of non-specific symptoms in the children s 
      histories, in addition to the impact on anaemia. This argues for improved malaria
      surveillance and control activities among school children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quinine or alternative artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) 
      is the recommended rescue treatment for uncomplicated malaria. However, patients 
      are often re-treated with the same ACT though it is unclear whether this is the
      most suitable approach. We assessed the efficacy and safety of re-treating
      malaria patients with uncomplicated failures with the same ACT used for the
      primary episode, compared with other rescue treatments. METHODS: This was a
      bicentre, open-label, randomised, three-arm phase 3 trial done in Lisungi health 
      centre in DR Congo, and Kazo health centre in Uganda in 2012-14. Children aged
      12-60 months with recurrent malaria infection after treatment with the first-line
      ACT were randomly assigned to either re-treatment with the same first-line ACT,
      an alternative ACT, which were given for 3 days, or quinine-clindamycin (QnC),
      which was given for 5-7 days, following a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomisation was done by 
      computer-generated randomisation list in a block design by country. The three
      treatment groups were assumed to have equivalent efficacy above 90%. Both the
      research team and parents or guardians were aware of treatment allocation. The
      primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28, in the per-protocol population. This
      trial was registered under the numbers NCT01374581 in ClinicalTrials.gov and
      PACTR201203000351114 in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry. FINDINGS: From 
      May 22, 2012, to Jan 31, 2014, 571 children were included in the trial. 240
      children were randomly assigned to the re-treatment ACT group, 233 to the
      alternative ACT group, and 98 to the QnC group. 500 children were assessed for
      the primary outcome. 71 others were not included because they did not complete
      the follow-up or PCR genotyping result was not conclusive. The ACPR response was 
      similar in the three groups: 91.4% (95% CI 87.5-95.2) for the re-treatment ACT,
      91.3% (95% CI 87.4-95.1) for the alternative ACT, and 89.5% (95% CI 83.0-96.0)
      for QnC. The estimates for rates of malaria recrudescence in the three treatment 
      groups were similar (log-rank test: chi2=0.22, p=0.894). Artemether-lumefantrine 
      was better tolerated than QnC (p=0.0005) and artesunate-amodiaquine (p<0.0001) in
      the modified intention-to-treat analysis. No serious adverse events were
      observed. The most common adverse events reported in the re-treatment ACT group
      were anorexia (31 [13%] of 240 patients), asthenia (20 [8%]), coughing (16 [7%]),
      abnormal behaviour (13 [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 [5%]). Anorexia (13 [6%] of 233
      patients) was the most frequently reported adverse event in the alternative ACT
      group. The most commonly reported adverse events in the QnC group were anorexia
      (12 [12%] of 98 patients), abnormal behaviour (6 [6%]), asthenia (6 [6%]), and
      pruritus (5 [5%]). INTERPRETATION: Re-treatment with the same ACT shows similar
      efficacy as recommended rescue treatments and could be considered for rescue
      treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, the effect of this approach
      on the selection of resistant strains should be monitored to ensure that
      re-treatment with the same ACT does not contribute to P falciparum resistance.

TI  - Identification of interchangeable cross-species function of elongation factor-1
      alpha promoters in Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis.
PG  - 576
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tick-borne Babesia bigemina is responsible for acute and potentially 
      lethal hemolytic disease in cattle. The development of genetic manipulation tools
      necessary to the better understanding of parasite biology is currently limited by
      the lack of a complete parasite genome and experimental tools such as
      transfection. Effective promoters, required to regulate expression of transgenes,
      such as the elongation factor-1 alpha (ef-1alpha), have been identified in other 
      apicomplexans such as Babesia bovis and Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: The B.
      bigemina ef-1a locus was defined by searching a partial genome library of B.
      bigemina (Sanger Institute). Presence of an intron in the 5' untranslated region 
      was determined by 5' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) analysis. Promoter
      activity was determined by measurement of luciferase expression at several time
      points after electroporation, efficiency of transfections and normalization of
      data was determined by quantitative PCR and by the percentage of parasitized
      erythrocytes. RESULTS: The ef-1alpha locus contains two identical head to head
      ef-1alpha genes separated by a 1.425 kb intergenic (IG) region. Significant
      sequence divergence in the regions upstream of the inverted repeats on each side 
      of the B. bigemina IG region suggest independent regulation mechanisms for
      controlling expression of each of the two ef-1alpha genes. Plasmid constructs
      containing the 5' and 3' halves of the IG regions controlling the expression of
      the luciferase gene containing a 3' region of a B. bigemina rap-1a gene, were
      generated for the testing of luciferase activity in transiently transfected
      parasites. Both halves of the ef-1alpha IG region tested showed the ability to
      promote high level production of luciferase. Moreover, both B. bigemina ef-1alpha
      promoters are also active in transiently transfected B. bovis and conversely, a
      B. bovis ef-1alpha promoter is active in transiently transfected B. bigemina.
      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively these data demonstrate the existence of two distinct
      promoters with homologous and heterologous promoter function in B. bigemina and
      B. bovis which is described for the first time in Babesia species. This study is 
      of significance for development of interspecies stable transfection systems for
      B. bigemina and for B. bovis.

TI  - Analysis of anti-malarial resistance markers in pfmdr1 and pfcrt across Southeast
      Asia in the Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration.
PG  - 541
AB  - BACKGROUND: Declining anti-malarial efficacy of artemisinin-based combination
      therapy, and reduced Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to individual
      anti-malarials are being documented across an expanding area of Southeast Asia
      (SEA). Genotypic markers complement phenotypic studies in assessing the efficacy 
      of individual anti-malarials. METHODS: The markers pfmdr1 and pfcrt were
      genotyped in parasite samples obtained in 2011-2014 at 14 TRAC (Tracking
      Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration) sites in mainland Southeast Asia using a
      combination of PCR and next-generation sequencing methods. RESULTS: Pfmdr1
      amplification, a marker of mefloquine and lumefantrine resistance, was highly
      prevalent at Mae Sot on the Thailand-Myanmar border (59.8% of isolates) and
      common (more than 10%) at sites in central Myanmar, eastern Thailand and western 
      Cambodia; however, its prevalence was lower than previously documented in Pailin,
      western Cambodia. The pfmdr1 Y184F mutation was common, particularly in and
      around Cambodia, and the F1226Y mutation was found in about half of samples in
      Mae Sot. The functional significance of these two mutations remains unclear.
      Other previously documented pfmdr1 mutations were absent or very rare in the
      region. The pfcrt mutation K76T associated with chloroquine resistance was found 
      in 98.2% of isolates. The CVIET haplotype made up 95% or more of isolates in
      western SEA while the CVIDT haplotype was common (30-40% of isolates) in north
      and northeastern Cambodia, southern Laos, and southern Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS:
      These findings generate cause for concern regarding the mid-term efficacy of
      artemether-lumefantrine in Myanmar, while the absence of resistance-conferring
      pfmdr1 mutations and SVMNT pfcrt haplotypes suggests that amodiaquine could be an
      efficacious component of anti-malarial regimens in SEA.

AB  - Highly sensitive and field deployable molecular diagnostic tools are critically
      needed for detecting submicroscopic, yet transmissible levels of malaria
      parasites prevalent in malaria endemic countries worldwide. A reverse
      transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was
      developed and evaluated in comparison with thick blood smear microscopy, an
      antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and an in-house RT-PCR targeting the
      same RT-LAMP transcript. The optimized assay detected Plasmodium falciparum
      infections in as little as 0.25ng of total parasite RNA, and exhibited a
      detection limit of 0.08 parasites/ muL when tested directly on infected whole
      blood lysates, or ~0.0008 parasites/ muL when using RNA extracts. Assay
      positivity was observed as early as eight minutes from initiation of the RT-LAMP 
      and in most cases the reaction was complete before twenty minutes. Clinical
      evaluation of the assay on 132 suspected malaria cases resulted in a positivity
      rate of 90% for RT-LAMP using extracted RNA, and 85% when using whole blood
      lysates. The positivity rates were 70% for P. falciparum-specific RDT, 83% for
      RT-PCR, and 74% for thick blood smear microscopy (Mean parasite density = 36,986 
      parasites/ muL). Concordance rates between the developed RT-LAMP and comparator
      tests were greater than 75%, the lowest being with light microscopy (78%,
      McNemar's test: P = 0.0002), and the highest was with RT-PCR (87%, McNemar's
      test: P = 0.0523). Compared to reference RT-PCR, assay sensitivity was 90% for
      RT-LAMP on whole blood, and 96% for RT-LAMP using corresponding RNA extracts.
      Electricity-free heaters were further developed and evaluated in comparison with 
      a battery-operated isothermal amplification machine for use with the developed
      test in resource-limited settings. Taken together, the data highlight the
      benefits of targeting high abundant RNA transcripts in molecular diagnosis, as
      well as the potential usefulness of the developed RT-LAMP-assay in malaria
      diagnosis in low to high parasite density settings.

      Test-Negative Febrile Patients in Low-Transmission Season, Mali.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0700 [doi]
AB  - From November to December 2012 in Selingue-Mali, blood samples from 88 febrile
      patients who tested negative by malaria Paracheck(R) rapid diagnostic tests
      (RDTs) were used to assess the presence of sub-RDT Plasmodium falciparum as well 
      as Borrelia, Coxiella burnetii, and Babesia applying molecular tools. Plasmodium 
      sp. was present among 57 (60.2%) of the 88 malaria RDT-negative patients, whereas
      the prevalence of Borrelia, C. burnetii, and Babesia were 3.4% (N = 3), 1.1% (N =
      1), and 0.0%, respectively. The additional diagnostic use of polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) identified a high proportion of Plasmodium sp.-positive samples
      and although this may be a concern for malaria control, the respective
      PCR-identified malaria infections were less likely responsible for the observed
      fevers given the low parasite density. Also, the low infection levels of Borrelia
      and C. burnetii and lack of Babesia among the febrile patients call for further
      studies to assess the causes of fever among malaria RDT-negative patients in
      Selingue.

TI  - Critical Evaluation of Molecular Monitoring in Malaria Drug Efficacy Trials and
      Pitfalls of Length-Polymorphic Markers.
LID - e01500-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01500-16 [doi]
AB  - Estimation of drug efficacy in antimalarial drug trials requires parasite
      genotyping to distinguish new infections from treatment failures. When using
      length-polymorphic molecular markers, preferential amplification of short
      fragments can compromise detection of coinfections, potentially leading to
      misclassification of treatment outcome. We quantified minority clone
      detectability and competition among msp1, msp2, and glurp amplicons using
      mixtures of Plasmodium falciparum strains and investigated the impact of template
      competition on genotyping outcomes in 44 paired field samples. Substantial
      amplification bias was detected for all three markers, with shorter fragments
      outperforming larger fragments. The strongest template competition was observed
      for the marker glurp Detection of glurp fragments in multiclonal infections was
      severely compromised. Eight of 44 sample pairs were identified as new infections 
      by all three markers. Ten pairs were defined as new infections based on one
      marker alone, seven of which were defined by the questionable marker glurp The
      impact of size-dependent template competition on genotyping outcomes therefore
      calls for necessary amendments to the current WHO recommendations for PCR
      correction of malaria drug trial endpoints. Accuracy of genotyping outcomes could
      be improved by separate amplification reactions per allelic family and basing
      results on markers msp1 and msp2 first, with glurp only used to resolve
      discordant results.

TI  - Molecular determinants of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium
      falciparum in Nigeria and the regional emergence of dhps 431V.

AB  - There are few published reports of mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps)
      and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes in P. falciparum populations in Nigeria,
      but one previous study has recorded a novel dhps mutation at codon 431 among
      infections imported to the United Kingdom from Nigeria. To assess how widespread 
      this mutation is among parasites in different parts of the country and
      consequently fill the gap in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance data in
      Nigeria, we retrospectively analysed 1000 filter paper blood spots collected in
      surveys of pregnant women and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      between 2003 and 2015 from four sites in the south and north. Genomic DNA was
      extracted from filter paper blood spots and placental impressions. Point
      mutations at codons 16, 50, 51, 59, 108, 140 and 164 of the dhfr gene and codons 
      431, 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 of the dhps gene were evaluated by nested PCR
      amplification followed by direct sequencing. The distribution of the dhps-431V
      mutation was widespread throughout Nigeria with the highest prevalence in Enugu
      (46%). In Ibadan where we had sequential sampling, its prevalence increased from 
      0% to 6.5% between 2003 and 2008. Although there were various combinations of
      dhps mutations with 431V, the combination 431V + 436A + 437G+581G+613S was the
      most common. All these observations support the view that dhps-431V is on the
      increase. In addition, P. falciparum DHPS crystal structure modelling shows that 
      the change from Isoleucine to Valine (dhps-431V) could alter the effects of both 
      S436A/F and A437G, which closely follow the 2nd beta-strand. Consequently, it is 
      now a research priority to assess the implications of dhps-VAGKGS mutant
      haplotype on continuing use of SP in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and
      intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). Our data also provides
      surveillance data for SP resistance markers in Nigeria between 2003 and 2015.

TI  - Comparison of molecular quantification of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes by
      Pfs25 qRT-PCR and QT-NASBA in relation to mosquito infectivity.
PG  - 539
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantifying gametocyte densities in natural malaria infections is
      important to estimate malaria transmission potential. Two molecular methods
      (Pfs25 mRNA quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and Pfs25 mRNA
      quantitative nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA)) are commonly
      used to determine gametocyte densities in clinical and epidemiological studies
      and allow gametocyte detection at densities below the microscopic threshold for
      detection. Here, reproducibility of these measurements and the association
      between estimated gametocyte densities and mosquito infection rates were
      compared. METHODS: To quantify intra- and inter-assay variation of QT-NASBA and
      qRT-PCR, a series of experiments was performed using culture-derived mature
      Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes from three different parasite isolates (NF54,
      NF135, NF166). Pfs25 mRNA levels were also determined in samples from clinical
      trials in Mali and Burkina Faso using both methods. Agreement between the two
      methods and association with mosquito infection rates in membrane feeding assays 
      were assessed. RESULTS: Intra- and inter-assay variability was larger in QT-NASBA
      compared to qRT-PCR, particularly at low gametocyte densities (< 1 gametocyte per
      muL). Logistic models, including log-transformed gametocytaemia estimated by
      QT-NASBA, explained variability in mosquito feeding experiment results as well as
      log-transformed gametocytaemia by qRT-PCR (marginal R2 0.28 and 0.22,
      respectively). Densities determined by both methods strongly correlated with
      mosquito infection rates [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, 0.59 for
      qRT-PCR and 0.64 for QT-NASBA (P < 0.001 for both)]. Gametocyte densities
      estimated by qRT-PCR were higher than levels estimated by QT-NASBA or light
      microscopy at high densities (>100 gametocyte per muL). Samples collected in one 
      of the two transmission studies had extremely low gametocyte densities by both
      molecular methods, which is suggestive of RNA degradation due to an unknown
      number of freeze-thaw cycles and illustrates the reliance of molecular gametocyte
      diagnostics on a reliable cold-chain. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments indicate that 
      both qRT-PCR and QT-NASBA are of value for quantifying mature gametocytes in
      samples collected in field studies. For both assays, estimated gametocyte
      densities correlated well with mosquito infection rates. QT-NASBA is less
      reproducible than qRT-PCR, particularly for low gametocyte densities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Western Cambodia is the epicentre of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug 
      resistance and is facing high rates of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment
      failures. Genetic tools to detect the multidrug-resistant parasites are needed.
      Artemisinin resistance can be tracked using the K13 molecular marker, but no
      marker exists for piperaquine resistance. We aimed to identify genetic markers of
      piperaquine resistance and study their association with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment failures. METHODS: We obtained blood
      samples from Cambodian patients infected with P falciparum and treated with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Patients were followed up for 42 days during the 
      years 2009-15. We established in-vitro and ex-vivo susceptibility profiles for a 
      subset using piperaquine survival assays. We determined whole-genome sequences by
      Illumina paired-reads sequencing, copy number variations by qPCR, RNA
      concentrations by qRT-PCR, and protein concentrations by immunoblotting. Fisher's
      exact and non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to identify
      significant differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number
      variants, respectively, for differential distribution between
      piperaquine-resistant and piperaquine-sensitive parasite lines. FINDINGS:
      Whole-genome exon sequence analysis of 31 culture-adapted parasite lines
      associated amplification of the plasmepsin 2-plasmepsin 3 gene cluster with
      in-vitro piperaquine resistance. Ex-vivo piperaquine survival assay profiles of
      134 isolates correlated with plasmepsin 2 gene copy number. In 725 patients
      treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, multicopy plasmepsin 2 in the sample
      collected before treatment was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for
      treatment failure of 20.4 (95% CI 9.1-45.5, p<0.0001). Multicopy plasmepsin 2
      predicted dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures with 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.98)
      sensitivity and 0.77 (0.74-0.81) specificity. Analysis of samples collected
      across the country from 2002 to 2015 showed that the geographical and temporal
      increase of the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites was highly
      correlated with increasing dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment failure rates
      (r=0.89 [95% CI 0.77-0.95], p<0.0001, Spearman's coefficient of rank
      correlation). Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine efficacy at day 42 fell below 90%
      when the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites exceeded 22%.
      INTERPRETATION: Piperaquine resistance in Cambodia is strongly associated with
      amplification of plasmepsin 2-3, encoding haemoglobin-digesting proteases,
      regardless of the location. Multicopy plasmepsin 2 constitutes a surrogate
      molecular marker to track piperaquine resistance. A molecular toolkit combining
      plasmepsin 2 with K13 and mdr1 monitoring should provide timely information for
      antimalarial treatment and containment policies. FUNDING: Institut Pasteur in

AB  - The significant strides made in reducing global malaria burden over the past
      decades are being threatened by the emergence of multi-drug resistant malaria.
      Mechanisms of resistance to several classes of antimalarial drugs have been
      linked to key mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum genes. Pyrimethamine targets
      the dihydrofolate reductase of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase
      thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and specific point mutations in the dhfr-ts gene 
      have been assigned to resistant phenotypes. Several molecular methods are
      available to detect the mutant genotypes including DNA sequencing and PCR-based
      methods. In this study, we report the development of PfSNP-LAMP to detect
      nucleotide polymorphism in the dhfr gene associated with N51I mutation and
      antifolate resistance. The PfSNP-LAMP method was validated with genomic DNA
      samples and parasite lysates prepared from sensitive and pyrimethamine resistant 
      strains of P. falciparum.

TI  - High prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte infections in school-age
      children using molecular detection: patterns and predictors of risk from a
      cross-sectional study in southern Malawi.
PG  - 527
AB  - BACKGROUND: In endemic areas, many people experience asymptomatic Plasmodium
      infections, particularly older children and adults, but their transmission
      contribution is unknown. Though not the exclusive determinant of infectiousness, 
      transmission from humans to mosquitoes requires blood meals containing
      gametocytes. Gametocytes often occur at submicroscopic densities, challenging
      measurement in human populations. More sensitive molecular techniques allow
      better characterization of gametocyte epidemiologic patterns. METHODS:
      Approximately 30 households were selected from each of eight sites in southern
      Malawi during two cross-sectional surveys. Blood was sampled from 623 people
      during the dry season and 896 the following rainy season. Among people
      PCR-positive for Plasmodium falciparum, mature gametocytes were detected by
      qRT-PCR. Regression models evaluated predictors of gametocyte carriage and
      density in the total population and among those with PCR-positive infections.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of gametocyte carriage by molecular testing was 3.5%
      during the dry season and 8.6% during the rainy season, and by microscopy 0.8 and
      3.3%, respectively. Nearly half of PCR-positive infections carried gametocytes,
      regardless of recent symptom status. Among P. falciparum-infected people, only
      living in unfinished houses and age were significantly associated with gametocyte
      presence. Infected people in unfinished houses had higher odds of carrying
      gametocytes (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16-4.31), and 31% (95% CI 3-65%) higher gametocyte
      density than those in finished houses. School-age children (5-15 years), had
      higher odds than adults (>/=16 years) of having gametocytes when infected (OR
      2.77, 95% CI 1.47-5.19), but 31% (95% CI 11-47%) lower gametocyte density.
      Children <5 years did not have significantly higher odds of gametocyte carriage
      or density when infected than adults. CONCLUSIONS: School-age children frequently
      carry gametocytes in communities of southern Malawi and represent an
      under-recognized reservoir of infection. Malaria elimination strategies should
      address these frequently asymptomatic reservoirs, especially in highly endemic
      areas. Improved household construction may also reduce the infectious reservoir.

TI  - Serological markers to measure recent changes in malaria at population level in
      Cambodia.
PG  - 529
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serological markers for exposure to different Plasmodium species have
      recently been used in multiplex immunoassays based on the Luminex technology.
      However, interpretation of the assay results requires consideration of the
      half-life of specific antibodies against these markers. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study was to document the half-life of malaria specific serological
      makers, as well as assessing the sensitivity of these markers to pick up recent
      changes in malaria exposure. METHODS: A recently developed multiplex immunoassay 
      was used to measure the intensity of antibody (Ab) responses against 19 different
      Plasmodium specific antigens, covering different human malaria parasites and two 
      vector saliva antigens. Therefore, 8439 blood samples from five cross-sectional
      surveys in Ratanakiri, Cambodia, were analysed. These involve a random selection 
      from two selected surveys, and an additional set of blood samples of individuals 
      that were randomly re-sampled three, four or five times. A generalized estimating
      equation model and linear regression models were fitted on log transformed
      antibody intensity data. RESULTS: Results showed that most (17/21) Ab-responses
      are higher in PCR positive than PCR negative individuals. Furthermore, these
      antibody-responses follow the same upward trend within each age group. Estimation
      of the half-lives showed differences between serological markers that reflect
      short- (seasonal) and long-term (year round) transmission trends. Ab levels
      declined significantly together with a decrease of PCR prevalence in a group of
      malaria endemic villages. CONCLUSION: For Plasmodium falciparum, antibodies
      against LSA3.RE, GLURP and Pf.GLURP.R2 are most likely to be a reflexion of
      recent (range from 6 to 8 months) exposure in the Mekong Subregion. PvEBP is the 
      only Plasmodium vivax Ag responding reasonably well, in spite of an estimated Ab 
      half-life of more than 1 year. The use of Ab intensity data rather dichotomizing 
      the continuous Ab-titre data (positive vs negative) will lead to an improved
      approach for serological surveillance.

TI  - Genetic diversity of the Pvk12 gene in Plasmodium vivax from the China-Myanmar
      border area.
PG  - 528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin emerged in the
      Greater Mekong Sub-region has been associated with mutations in the propeller
      domain of the kelch gene Pfk13. METHODS: Here the polymorphisms in Pvk12 gene,
      the orthologue of Pfk13 in Plasmodium vivax, were determined by PCR and
      sequencing in 262 clinical isolates collected in recent years (2012-2015) from
      the China-Myanmar border area. RESULTS: Sequencing of full-length Pvk12 genes
      from these isolates identified three synonymous mutations (N172N, S360S, S697S)
      and one non-synonymous mutation M124I, all of which were at very low prevalence
      (2.0-3.1%). Moreover, these mutations were non-overlapping between the two study 
      sites on both sides of the border. Molecular evolutionary analysis detected
      signature of purifying selection on Pvk12. CONCLUSIONS: There is no direct
      evidence that Pvk12 is involved in artemisinin resistance in P. vivax, but it
      remains a potential candidate requiring further investigation. Continuous
      monitoring of potential drug resistance in this parasite is needed in order to
      facilitate the regional malaria elimination campaign.

AB  - Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane-bound proteins, originally described
      as water-channels, that broadly exist in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
      However, some AQPs can transport small molecules (e.g. urea, glycerol) along with
      or preferentially to water. Previous work in the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and
      Anopheles gambiae have characterized the molecular expression of one or more AQP 
      genes and shown that they are involved in water homeostasis after blood feeding, 
      tolerance to dehydration and heat stresses, and development of Plasmodium
      falciparum in the mosquito. However, the molecular expression of AQPs in the
      northern house mosquito Culex pipiens, the primary vector of West Nile virus, is 
      presently unknown. Here we characterize the relative mRNA expression of six AQP
      genes in C. pipiens. We used quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) to compare AQP mRNA
      levels 1) among different life stages and sexes, 2) between blood fed and
      non-blood fed adult females, 3) between adult females injected with
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and non-injected females, and 4) between adult
      females exposed to a low vs. high relative humidity. We found that: 1) four AQP
      mRNAs (Drip, Bib, Eglp1, Aqp12L) were differentially expressed between larval and
      adult life stages, but not between sexes; 2) after a blood meal, the expression
      of two AQP mRNAs (Drip and Aqp12L) were down-regulated and one AQP mRNA (Eglp2)
      was up-regulated; 3) the expression of two AQP mRNAs (Drip and Prip) were
      down-regulated and one AQP mRNA (Eglp1) was up regulated after injecting the
      hemolymph of mosquitoes with PBS; and 4) the expression of Prip and Eglp2 mRNAs
      were both down-regulated in response to a low relative humidity. Our study is the
      first to characterize the molecular expression patterns of AQPs in C. pipiens,
      thus providing a foundation for future research elucidating the physiological and
      functional roles of AQPs in this important disease vector.

TI  - West Africa International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research: Drug
      Resistance Patterns to Artemether-Lumefantrine in Senegal, Mali, and The Gambia.
PG  - 1054-1060
AB  - In 2006, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) became the first-line treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in Senegal, Mali, and the Gambia. To monitor its efficacy, 
      between August 2011 and November 2014, children with uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria were treated with AL and followed up for 42 days. A total of
      463 subjects were enrolled in three sites (246 in Senegal, 97 in Mali, and 120 in
      Gambia). No early treatment failure was observed and malaria infection cleared in
      all patients by day 3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted adequate clinical
      and parasitological response (ACPR) was 100% in Mali, and the Gambia, and 98.8%
      in Senegal. However, without PCR adjustment, ACPR was 89.4% overall; 91.5% in
      Mali, 98.8% in Senegal, and 64.3% in the Gambia (the lower value in the Gambia
      attributed to poor compliance of the full antimalarial course). However, pfmdr1
      mutations were prevalent in Senegal and a decrease in parasite sensitivity to
      artesunate and lumefantrine (as measured by ex vivo drug assay) was observed at
      all sites. Recrudescent parasites did not show Kelch 13 (K13) mutations and AL
      remains highly efficacious in these west African sites.

TI  - Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance markers reveals
      partial recovery of chloroquine susceptibility but sustained
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance at two sites of different malaria
      transmission intensities in Rwanda.

AB  - Faced with intense levels of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria, Rwanda replaced CQ with amodiaquine (AQ)+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 
      in 2001, and subsequently with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 2006, as
      first-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria. Following years of
      discontinuation of CQ use, re-emergence of CQ-susceptible parasites has been
      reported in countries including Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania. In contrast, high
      levels of SP resistant mutant parasites continue to be reported even in countries
      of presumed reduced SP drug selection pressure. The prevalence and distributions 
      of genetic polymorphisms linked with CQ and SP resistance at two sites of
      different malaria transmission intensities are described here to better
      understand drug-related genomic adaptations over time and exposure to varying
      drug pressures in Rwanda. Using filter paper blood isolates collected from P.
      falciparum infected patients, DNA was extracted and a nested PCR performed to
      identify resistance-mediating polymorphisms in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps and
      pfdhfr genes. Amplicons from a total of 399 genotyped samples were analysed by
      ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere assay. CQ susceptible pfcrt 76K
      and pfmdr1 86N wild-type parasites were found in about 50% and 81% of isolates,
      respectively. Concurrently, SP susceptible pfdhps double (437G-540E), pfdhfr
      triple (108N-51I-59R), quintuple pfdhps 437G-540E/pfdhfr 51I-59R-108N and
      sextuple haplotypes were found in about 84%, 85%, 74% and 18% of isolates,
      respectively. High-level SP resistance associated pfdhfr 164L and pfdhps 581G
      mutant prevalences were noted to decline. Mutations pfcrt 76T, pfdhfr 59R and
      pfdhfr 164L were found differentially distributed between the two study sites
      with the pfdhfr 164L mutants found only at Ruhuha site, eastern Rwanda. Overall, 
      sustained intense levels of SP resistance mutations and a recovery of CQ
      susceptible parasites were found in this study following 7 years and 14 years of 
      drug withdrawal from use, respectively. Most likely, the sustained high
      prevalence of resistant parasites is due to the use of DHFR/DHPS inhibitors like 
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) for the treatment of and prophylaxis against
      bacterial infections among HIV infected individuals as well as the continued use 
      of IPTp-SP within the East and Central African regions for malaria prevention
      among pregnant women. With regard to CQ, the slow recovery of CQ susceptible
      parasites may have been caused partly by the continued use of CQ and/or CQ
      mimicking antimalarial drugs like AQ in spite of policies to withdraw it from
      Rwanda and the neighbouring countries of Uganda and Tanzania. Continued
      surveillance of P. falciparum CQ and SP associated polymorphisms is recommended
      for guiding future rational drug policy-making and mitigation of future risk of
      anti-malaria drug resistance development.

AB  - Artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) and artemether+lumefantrine (AL) are
      the first- and second line treatments, respectively, for the treatment of
      falciparum infections and dihydroartemsinin+piperaquine (DHA+PPQ) is a potential 
      candidate in case AS+SP or AL fails in Pakistan. The therapeutic efficacies of
      AS+SP (5 sites in 2007, 2 sites in 2011 and 2 sites in 2012), AL (2 sites in
      2012) and DHA+PPQ (2 sites in 2015) were evaluated in seven sentinel sites.
      Clinical and parasitological outcomes were evaluated among eligible patients.
      Mutations of the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
      synthase (dhps) genes were investigated. After PCR correction, a 98.5-100%
      adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) for AS+SP and a 98.8-100%
      ACPR for AL were observed by day 28, as well as a 100% ACPR by day 42 for
      DHA+PPQ. The prevalences of mutants dhfr S108N (100%) and C59R (98%-100%) reached
      or were near fixation. The double dhfr (C59R/S108N) mutant was dominant
      (96%-100%) at all sites. The triple dhfr (N51I/C59R/S108N) mutant was rare
      (1.1%-2.3%). The prevalence of dhps A437G varied between 38% and 70%. A
      combination of triple dhfr/dhps (C59R/S108N+A437G or N51I/S108N+A437G) mutants
      was observed (38%-69%). A quadruple dhfr/dhps (N51I/C59R/S108N+A437G) mutation
      was very rare and no quintuple (N51I/C59R/S108N+A437G/K540E) mutations were
      detected. AS+SP remains highly effective in Pakistan. However, molecular data
      indicate that SP resistance is being established, although mutations that confer 
      a high risk of SP treatment failure are rare or non-existent. This underscores
      the need for close monitoring of both in vivo AS+SP efficacy and dhfr and dhps
      mutations to inform national treatment policy. Trial registration numbers:

TI  - Submicroscopic and Asymptomatic Plasmodium Parasitaemia Associated with
      Significant Risk of Anaemia in Papua, Indonesia.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165340 [doi]
AB  - Submicroscopic Plasmodium infections are an important parasite reservoir, but
      their clinical relevance is poorly defined. A cross-sectional household survey
      was conducted in southern Papua, Indonesia, using cluster random sampling. Data
      were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples were collected
      for haemoglobin measurement. Plasmodium parasitaemia was determined by blood film
      microscopy and PCR. Between April and July 2013, 800 households and 2,830
      individuals were surveyed. Peripheral parasitaemia was detected in 37.7%
      (968/2,567) of individuals, 36.8% (357) of whom were identified by blood film
      examination. Overall the prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was 15.4%
      (396/2567) and that of P. vivax 18.3% (471/2567). In parasitaemic individuals,
      submicroscopic infection was significantly more likely in adults (adjusted odds
      ratio (AOR): 3.82 [95%CI: 2.49-5.86], p<0.001) compared to children, females (AOR
      = 1.41 [1.07-1.86], p = 0.013), individuals not sleeping under a bednet (AOR =
      1.4 [1.0-1.8], p = 0.035), and being afebrile (AOR = 3.2 [1.49-6.93], p = 0.003).
      The risk of anaemia (according to WHO guidelines) was 32.8% and significantly
      increased in those with asymptomatic parasitaemia (AOR 2.9 [95% 2.1-4.0], p =
      0.007), and submicroscopic P. falciparum infections (AOR 2.5 [95% 1.7-3.6], p =
      0.002). Asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections in this area co-endemic for P.
      falciparum and P. vivax constitute two thirds of detectable parasitaemia and are 
      associated with a high risk of anaemia. Novel public health strategies are needed
      to detect and eliminate these parasite reservoirs, for the benefit both of the
      patient and the community.

TI  - Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum Molecular Markers of Antimalarial Drug
      Resistance in a Residual Malaria Focus Area in Sabah, Malaysia.
PG  - e0165515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165515 [doi]
AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) and fansidar (sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) were widely used
      for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum for several decades in Malaysia prior to
      the introduction of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) in 2008. Our
      previous study in Kalabakan, located in south-east coast of Sabah showed a high
      prevalence of resistance to CQ and SP, suggesting the use of the treatment may no
      longer be effective in the area. This study aimed to provide a baseline data of
      antimalarial drug resistant markers on P. falciparum isolates in Kota Marudu
      located in the north-east coast of Sabah. Mutations on genes associated with CQ
      (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and SP (pfdhps and pfdhfr) were assessed by PCR amplification 
      and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Mutations on the kelch13 marker
      (K13) associated with artemisinin resistance were determined by DNA sequencing
      technique. The assessment of pfmdr1 copy number variation associated with
      mefloquine resistant was done by real-time PCR technique. A low prevalence (6.9%)
      was indicated for both pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y mutations. All P. falciparum
      isolates harboured the pfdhps A437G mutation. Prevalence of pfdhfr gene
      mutations, S108N and I164L, were 100% and 10.3%, respectively. Combining the
      different resistant markers, only two isolates were conferred to have CQ and SP
      treatment failure markers as they contained mutant alleles of pfcrt and pfmdr1
      together with quintuple pfdhps/pfdhfr mutation (combination of pfdhps A437G+A581G
      and pfdhfr C59R+S108N+I164L). All P. falciparum isolates carried single copy
      number of pfmdr1 and wild type K13 marker. This study has demonstrated a low
      prevalence of CQ and SP resistance alleles in the study area. Continuous
      monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is warranted and the findings provide
      information for policy makers in ensuring a proper malaria control.

TI  - Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in relation to drug exposure in children with
      and without severe acute malnutrition: an open comparative intervention study in 
      Mali and Niger.
PG  - 167
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) affects almost all organs and has
      been associated with reduced intestinal absorption of medicines. However, very
      limited information is available on the pharmacokinetic properties of
      antimalarial drugs in this vulnerable population. We assessed
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) clinical efficacy in children with SAM compared to
      those without. METHODS: Children under 5 years of age with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria were enrolled between November 2013 and January 2015 in Mali
      and Niger, one third with uncomplicated SAM and two thirds without. AL was
      administered under direct observation with a fat intake consisting of
      ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF - Plumpy'Nut(R)) in SAM children, twice daily
      during 3 days. Children were followed for 42 days, with PCR-corrected adequate
      clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28 as the primary outcome.
      Lumefantrine concentrations were assessed in a subset of participants at
      different time points, including systematic measurements on day 7. RESULTS: A
      total of 399 children (360 in Mali and 39 in Niger) were enrolled. Children with 
      SAM were younger than their non-SAM counterparts (mean 17 vs. 28 months, P <
      0.0001). PCR-corrected ACPR was 100 % (95 % CI, 96.8-100 %) in SAM at both day 28
      and 42, versus 98.8 % (96.4-99.7 %) at day 28 and 98.3 % (95.6-99.4 %) at day 42 
      in non-SAM (P = 0.236 and 0.168, respectively). Compared to younger children,
      children older than 21 months experienced more reinfections and SAM was
      associated with a greater risk of reinfection until day 28 (adjusted hazard ratio
      = 2.10 (1.04-4.22), P = 0.038). Day 7 lumefantrine concentrations were
      significantly lower in SAM than non-SAM (median 251 vs. 365 ng/mL, P = 0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study shows comparable therapeutic efficacy of AL in children
      without SAM and in those with SAM when given in combination with RUTF, but a
      higher risk of reinfection in older children suffering from SAM. This could be
      associated with poorer exposure to the antimalarials as documented by a lower
      lumefantrine concentration on day 7. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov:
      NCT01958905 , registration date: October 7, 2013.

TI  - Preferential expression of domain cassettes 4, 8 and 13 of Plasmodium falciparum 
      erythrocyte membrane protein 1 in severe malaria imported in France.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria (SM) involves cytoadhesion of
      parasitized red blood cells, mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
      protein 1, which is encoded by var genes. Expression of var gene group A and B or
      encoding domain cassettes DC4, DC5, DC8 and DC13 has been implicated in SM in
      African children, but no data exist in the context of imported malaria. The aim
      of this study was to investigate var gene expression linked to clinical
      presentation and host factors in SM imported into France. METHODS: Expression
      level of var gene groups A, B, C, var1, var2csa, var3 and var genes encoding DC4,
      DC5, DC8 and DC13 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and expressed in transcript
      units. Seventy SM and 48 uncomplicated malaria (UM) P. falciparum cases were
      analysed according to disease severity, epidemiological characteristics (migrants
      or travellers) and anti-P. falciparum antibodies. Cluster analysis was performed 
      to identify gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Var1 and B/C expression were
      higher in UM than SM (0.66 (0-1.1) and 1.88 (1.3-2.4); p <0.04, respectively).
      Group C expression differed between migrants and travellers (0.21 (0-0.75) versus
      0 (0-0); p 0.002). Group A differed in naive and pre-exposed patients (1.1
      (0.7-1.5) versus 0.4 (0-1.1); p 0.01). Population clusters revealed increased
      expression from group A and B var genes, and DC4, DC8 and DC13 in SM.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate the implication of DC4, DC8 and DC13 in
      severe imported malaria cases as African children, and their expression depends
      of host factors.

AB  - Malaria transmission along international borders of the Greater Mekong Subregion 
      is a big challenge for regional malaria elimination. At the Thai-Myanmar border, 
      Plasmodium falciparum cases have dropped dramatically; however, increasing P.
      vivax prevalence and the emerging reports on hidden malaria burden due to
      asymptomatic infections demand attention. We conducted cross-sectional surveys to
      detect asymptomatic malaria infections in a small village located at Thai-Myanmar
      border and genotyped P. vivax infections in order to understand the level of
      genetic diversity on such a microgeographic scale. PCR/RFLP and DNA sequencing
      identified high levels of genetic polymorphisms at both Pvmsp3alpha and
      Pvmsp3beta loci among P. vivax infections. Combining the PCR/RFLP patterns of
      Pvmsp3alpha and Pvmsp3beta, a total of 10 genotypes were observed among 17
      samples, while concatenated DNA sequences of Pvmsp3alpha and 3beta generated 14
      haplotypes with haplotype diversity of 0.97. These markedly diverse parasites on 
      a microgeographic scale suggest the circulation of a considerably large parasite 
      population at the international border.

TI  - Asymptomatic malaria, growth status, and anaemia among children in Lao People's
      Democratic Republic: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 499
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic malaria can be observed in both stable endemic areas and
      unstable transmission areas. However, although much attention has been given to
      acute malaria infections, relatively little attention has been paid to
      asymptomatic malaria. Nonetheless, because the asymptomatic host serves as a
      reservoir for the malaria parasite, asymptomatic malaria is now recognized as an 
      important obstacle to malaria elimination. Asymptomatic malaria is also
      associated with anaemia, a global public health problem with serious consequences
      on human health as well as social and economic development. In Lao People's
      Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), malaria, anaemia, and malnutrition are serious
      public health concerns. However, few studies have focused on the relationship
      between these variables. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship
      between asymptomatic malaria, growth status, and the prevalence of anaemia among 
      children aged 120 months old or younger in rural villages in Lao PDR. METHODS: In
      December 2010 and March 2011, data were collected from five villages in
      Savannakhet province. Anthropometric measurements, blood samples, and malaria
      rapid diagnostic tests were conducted. The presence of malaria was confirmed with
      polymerase chain reaction assays for Plasmodium falciparum. Underweight status,
      stunting, and anaemia were defined according to World Health Organization
      standards. RESULTS: The mean age of participants (n = 319) was 88.3 months old
      (Standard Deviation: 20.6, ranged from 30-119 months old), and 20 participants
      (6.3 %) had an asymptomatic malaria infection, 92 (28.8 %) were anaemic, 123
      (38.6 %) were underweight, and 137 (42.9 %) were stunted. Stunted children were
      more likely to be infected with asymptomatic malaria [odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95 % 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.25-8.93], and asymptomatic malaria was associated with
      anaemia [OR 5.17, 95 % CI 1.99-13.43]. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a
      significant association between asymptomatic malaria and anaemia in children.
      Furthermore, stunted children were more likely to have lower Hb levels and to be 
      infected with asymptomatic malaria than children without stunting. However,
      further studies examining the impact of asymptomatic malaria infection on
      children's nutritional and development status are necessary.

TI  - Geographical patterns of malaria transmission based on serological markers for
      falciparum and vivax malaria in Ratanakiri, Cambodia.
PG  - 510
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is highly heterogeneous, especially in low
      endemic countries, such as Cambodia. This results in geographical clusters of
      residual transmission in the dry, low transmission season, which can fuel the
      transmission to wider areas or populations during the wet season. A better
      understanding of spatial clustering of malaria can lead to a more efficient,
      targeted strategy to reduce malaria transmission. This study aims to evaluate the
      potential of the use of serological markers to define spatial patterns in malaria
      exposure. METHODS: Blood samples collected in a community-based randomized trial 
      performed in 98 high endemic communities in Ratanakiri province, north-eastern
      Cambodia, were screened with a multiplex serological assay for five serological
      markers (three Plasmodium falciparum and two Plasmodium vivax). The antibody
      half-lives range from approximately six months until more than two years.
      Geographical heterogeneity in malaria transmission was examined using a spatial
      scan statistic on serology, PCR prevalence and malaria incidence rate data.
      Furthermore, to identify behavioural patterns or intrinsic factors associated
      with malaria exposure (antibody levels), risk factor analyses were performed by
      using multivariable random effect logistic regression models. The serological
      outcomes were then compared to PCR prevalence and malaria incidence data.
      RESULTS: A total of 6502 samples from two surveys were screened in an area where 
      the average parasite prevalence estimated by PCR among the selected villages is
      3.4 %. High-risk malaria pockets were observed adjacent to the 'Tonle San River' 
      and neighbouring Vietnam for all three sets of data (serology, PCR prevalence and
      malaria incidence rates). The main risk factors for all P. falciparum antigens
      and P. vivax MSP1.19 are age, ethnicity and staying overnight at the plot hut.
      CONCLUSION: It is possible to identify similar malaria pockets of higher malaria 
      transmission together with the potential risk factors by using serology instead
      of PCR prevalence or malaria incidence data. In north-eastern Cambodia, the
      serological markers show that malaria transmission occurs mainly in adults
      staying overnight in plot huts in the field. Pf.GLURP.R2 showed a shrinking
      pocket of malaria transmission over time, and Pf.MSP1.19, CSP, PvAMA1 were also
      informative for current infection to a lesser extent. Therefore, serology could
      contribute in future research. However, further in-depth research in selecting
      the best combination of antigens is required.

TI  - Household clustering of asymptomatic malaria infections in Xepon district,
      Savannakhet province, Lao PDR.
PG  - 508
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Lao PDR, malaria morbidity and mortality have remarkably
      decreased over the past decade. However, asymptomatic infections in rural
      villages contribute to the on-going local transmission. The primary objective of 
      this study was to explore the characteristics of infections in a malaria-endemic 
      district of the Lao PDR. The specific objectives were to investigate the
      prevalence and species of malaria parasites using molecular methods and to assess
      individual and household parasite levels and the characteristics associated with 
      malaria infection. METHODS: The study population included 870 participants from
      236 households in 10 villages of the Xepon district. Interviews, blood
      examinations and body temperature measurements were conducted between August and 
      September 2013. A multilevel logistic regression model, with adjustment for
      clustering effects, was used to assess the association between predictor
      variables and an outcome variable (malaria infection status as principally
      determined by PCR). The predictive factors included individual-level factors
      (age, gender, past fever episode, and forest activity during night time) and
      household-level factors (household member size, household bed net usage/density
      and a household with one other malaria-infected member). RESULTS: Fifty-two
      participants (including 26 children) tested positive (positive rate: 6.0 %):
      Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection was the most common infection (n = 41, 78.8 
      %), followed by P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax mixed infections (n = 9, 17.3 
      %). The majority of infected participants (n = 42, 80.8 %) had no fever episodes 
      in the two previous weeks or a measurable fever (>37 degrees C) at the time of
      survey. Living in a household with one other malaria-infected member
      significantly increased the odds of infection (odds ratio 24.33, 95 % confidence 
      interval 10.15-58.32). Among the 40 households that had at least one infected
      member, nine households were responsible for 40.4 % of the total infections.
      CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium vivax was detected more frequently than it was reported
      from the district hospital. Most infections were asymptomatic and sub-microscopic
      and were highly clustered within households. To further eliminate malaria in
      Xepon and other similar settings in the country, the National Malaria Control
      Programme should consider household-based strategies, including reactive case
      detection targeting the household members of index cases.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum infection in febrile Congolese children: prevalence of
      clinical malaria 10 years after introduction of artemisinin-combination
      therapies.
PG  - 1496-1503
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12786 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the proportion of malaria infection in febrile
      children consulting a paediatric hospital in Brazzaville, to determine the
      prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infection, to characterise Plasmodium
      falciparum infection and compare the prevalence of uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria according to haemoglobin profiles. METHODS: Blood samples were collected 
      from children aged <10 years with an axillary temperature >/=37.5 degrees C
      consulting the paediatric ward of Marien Ngouabi Hospital in Brazzaville.
      Parasite density was determined and all samples were screened for P. falciparum
      by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the P. falciparum msp-2 marker to
      detect submicroscopic infections and characterise P. falciparum infection. Sickle
      cell trait was screened by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 229 children with fever were 
      recruited, of whom 10% were diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria and 21% with
      submicroscopic infection. The mean parasite density in children with
      uncomplicated malaria was 42 824 parasites/mul of blood. The multiplicity of
      infection (MOI) was 1.59 in children with uncomplicated malaria and 1.69 in
      children with submicroscopic infection. The mean haemoglobin level was 10.1 +/-
      1.7 for children with uncomplicated malaria and 12.0 +/- 8.6 for children with
      submicroscopic infection. About 13% of the children harboured the sickle cell
      trait (HbAS); the rest had normal haemoglobin (HbAA). No difference in prevalence
      of uncomplicated malaria and submicroscopic infection, parasite density,
      haemoglobin level, MOI and P. falciparum genetic diversity was observed according
      to haemoglobin type. CONCLUSION: The low prevalence of uncomplicated malaria in
      febrile Congolese children indicates the necessity to investigate carefully other
      causes of fever.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria from three highly malarious states in
      India.
PG  - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance continues to be a leading threat to
      malaria control efforts and calls for continued monitoring of waning efficacy of 
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Artesunate +
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS + SP) is used for the treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in India. However, resistance against AS + SP is
      emerged in northeastern states. Therefore, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the
      recommended first line treatment for falciparum malaria in north eastern states. 
      This study investigates the therapeutic efficacy and safety of AL for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in three malaria-endemic states in 
      India. The data generated through this study will benefit the immediate
      implementation of second-line ACT as and when required. METHODS: This was a
      one-arm prospective evaluation of clinical and parasitological responses for
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria using WHO protocol. Patients diagnosed with
      uncomplicated mono P. falciparum infection were administered six-dose regimen of 
      AL over 3 days and subsequent follow-up was carried out up to 28 days. Molecular 
      markers msp-1 and msp-2 were used to differentiate recrudescence and re-infection
      and K13 propeller gene was amplified and sequenced covering the codon 450-680.
      RESULTS: A total of 402 eligible patients were enrolled in the study from all
      four sites. Overall, adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) was 98
      % without PCR correction and 99 % with PCR correction. At three study sites, ACPR
      rates were 100 %, while at Bastar, cure rate was 92.5 % on day 28. No early
      treatment failure was found. The PCR-corrected endpoint finding confirmed that
      one late clinical failure (LCF) and two late parasitological failures (LPF) were 
      recrudescences. The PCR corrected cure rate was 96.5 %. The mean fever clearance 
      time was 27.2 h +/- 8.2 (24-48 h) and the mean parasite clearance time was 30.1 h
      +/- 11.0 (24-72 h). Additionally, no adverse event was recorded. Analysis of
      total 186 samples revealed a mutation in the k13 gene along with non-synonymous
      mutation at codon M579T in three (1.6 %) samples. CONCLUSION: AL is an
      efficacious drug for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. However, 
      regular monitoring of AL is required in view of malaria elimination initiatives, 
      which will be largely dependent on therapeutic interventions, regular
      surveillance and targeted vector control.

TI  - Molecular evidence of high rates of asymptomatic P. vivax infection and very low 
      P. falciparum malaria in Botswana.
PG  - 520
AB  - BACKGROUND: Botswana is one of eight SADC countries targeting malaria elimination
      by 2018. Through spirited upscaling of control activities and passive
      surveillance, significant reductions in case incidence of Plasmodium falciparum
      (0.96 - 0.01) was achieved between 2008 and 2012. As part of the elimination
      campaign, active detection of asymptomatic Plasmodium species by a highly
      sensitive method was deemed necessary. This study was carried out to determine
      asymptomatic Plasmodium species carriage by nested PCR in the country, in 2012.
      METHOD: A cross-sectional study involving 3924 apparently healthy participants
      were screened for Plasmodium species in 14 districts (5 endemic: Okavango, Ngami,
      Tutume, Boteti and Bobirwa; and 9 epidemic: North East, Francistown,
      Serowe-Palapye, Ghanzi, Kweneng West, Kweneng East, Kgatleng, South East, and
      Good Hope). Venous blood was taken from each participant for a nested PCR
      detection of Plasmodium species. RESULTS: The parasite rates of asymptomatic
      Plasmodium species detected were as follows: Plasmodium falciparum, 0.16 %;
      Plasmodium vivax, 4.66 %; Plasmodium malariae, (Pm) 0.16 %; Plasmodium ovale, 0
      %, mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax), 0.055 %; and (P. vivax and P.
      malariae), 0.027 %, (total: 5.062 %). The high proportion of asymptomatic
      reservoir of P. vivax was clustered in the East, South Eastern and Central
      districts of the country. There appeared to be a correlation between the
      occurrence of P. malariae infection with P. vivax infection, with the former only
      occurring in districts that had substantial P. vivax circulation. The median age 
      among 2-12 year olds for P. vivax infection was 5 years (Mean 5.13 years,
      interquartile range 3-7 years). The odds of being infected with P. vivax
      decreased by 7 % for each year increase in age (OR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.87-1.00, p =
      0.056). CONCLUSION: We have confirmed low parasite rate of asymptomatic
      Plasmodium species in Botswana, with the exception of P.vivax which was
      unexpectedly high. This has implication for the elimination campaign so a follow 
      up study is warranted to inform decisions on new strategies that take this
      evidence into account in the elimination campaign.

TI  - Role of An. culicifacies as a vector of malaria in changing ecological scenario
      of Northeastern states of India.
PG  - 264-71
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria has become endemic and subject of concern in
      most part of the India especially Northeastern states of India. Surveys before
      2000 revealed that Anopheles minimus was major vector responsible for
      transmission of malaria in this region followed by An. dirus and An. fluviatilis.
      However, recent studies indicate replacement of An. minimus vector by An.
      culicifacies due to different ecological changes and change in landuse pattern
      etc. The objective of present study was to explore the vectorial role of An.
      culicifacies in transmission of malaria in four malaria endemic states, viz.
      Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Sikkim of India. METHODS: The seven surveys were
      conducted in 176 selected villages belonging to eight districts of the four
      states in both pre-monsoon (March-April) and post-monsoon (September-October)
      seasons from 2010 to 2013. However, in 2011 surveys could not be carried out due 
      to public inconvenience in pre-monsoon season. For vectorial role of all vector
      species collected, ELISA and PCR were assayed. RESULTS: A total of 19,173
      specimens belonging to 30 anopheline species were collected, out of which 4315
      belonged to four established vector species. In total, 4183 specimens were
      processed through ELISA, out of which 236 specimens were found positive for
      circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Further, infectivity was confirmed by PCR in 35
      samples, of which 12 samples were found positive for Plasmodium falciparum and
      three for P. vivax. Out of 12 Plasmodium falciparum positive samples, nine
      samples were positive for An. culicifacies, two for An. fluviatilis and one for
      An. minimus. While out of three Plasmodium vivax positive samples, two samples
      were positive for An. dirus and one sample was positive for An. culicifacies.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Anopheles culicifacies replaced the An. minimus, the
      vector of malaria in Northeastern states of India, as it was found to be highly
      infected with malaria parasite as compared to An. minimus by ELISA and PCR
      analysis, and thus playing a major role in malaria transmission in this region.
      The ecological changes like deforestation, development of irrigation channels and
      change in landuse pattern, have helped in evolution of An. culicifacies in the
      study area. Therefore, modified vector control strategies are required on urgent 
      basis.

TI  - Plasmodium vivax msp-3alpha polymorphisms: analysis in the Indian subcontinent.
PG  - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed human malaria
      parasite and accounts for approximately the same number of malaria cases as
      Plasmodium falciparum in India. Compared with P. falciparum, P. vivax is
      difficult to eradicate because of its tendency to cause relapses, which impacts
      treatment and control strategies. The genetic diversity of these parasites,
      particularly of the merozoite surface protein-3 alpha (msp-3alpha) gene, can be
      used to help develop a potential vaccine. The present study aimed to investigate 
      the genetic diversity of P. vivax using the highly polymorphic antigen gene
      msp-3alpha and to assess the suitability of using this gene for population
      genetic studies of P. vivax isolates and was carried out in 2004-06. No recent
      study has been reported for MSP 3alpha in the recent decade in India. Limited
      reports are available on the genetic diversity of the P. vivax population in
      India; hence, this report aimed to improve the understanding of the molecular
      epidemiology of the parasite by studying the P. vivax msp-3alpha (Pvmsp-3alpha)
      marker from P. vivax field isolates from India. METHODS: Field isolates were
      collected from different sites distributed across eight states in India. A total 
      of 182 blood samples were analysed by a nested polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique using the 
      HhaI and AluI restriction enzymes to determine genetic msp-3alpha variation among
      clinical P. vivax isolates. RESULTS: Based on the length variants of the PCR
      products of Pvmsp-3alpha gene, three allele sizes, Type A (1.8 kb), Type B (1.5
      kb) and Type C (1.2 kb) were detected among the 182 samples. Type A PCR amplicon 
      was more predominant (75.4 %) in the samples compared with the Type B (14.3 %)
      and Type C (10.0 %) polymorphisms. Among all of the samples analysed, 8.2 % were 
      mixed infections detected by PCR alone. Restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (RFLP) analysis involving the restriction enzymes AluI and HhaI generated
      fragment sizes that were highly polymorphic and revealed substantial diversity at
      the nucleotide level. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first extensive study
      in India using the Pvmsp-3alpha marker. The results indicated that Pvmps-3alpha, 
      a polymorphic genetic marker of P. vivax, exhibited considerable variability in
      infection prevalence in field isolates from India. Additionally, the mean
      multiplicity of infection observed at all of the study sites indicated that P.
      vivax is highly diverse in nature in India, and Pvmsp-3alpha is likely an
      effective and promising epidemiological marker.

TI  - Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine and Amodiaquine 
      Selects Pfdhfr-dhps Quintuple Mutant Genotype in Mali.
PG  - e0162718
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0162718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) is being scaled up in
      Sahelian countries of West Africa. However, the potential development of
      Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the respective component drugs is a major
      concern. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted before (August 2012)
      and after (June 2014) a pilot implementation of SMC in Koutiala, Mali. Children
      aged 3-59 months received 7 rounds of curative doses of SP plus AQ over two
      malaria seasons. Genotypes of P. falciparum Pfdhfr codons 51, 59 and 108; Pfdhps 
      codons 437 and 540, Pfcrt codon 76 and Pfmdr1codon 86 were analyzed by PCR on DNA
      from samples collected before and after SMC, and in non-SMC patient population as
      controls (November 2014). RESULTS: In the SMC population 191/662 (28.9%) and
      85/670 (12.7%) of children were P. falciparum positive by microscopy and were
      included in the molecular analysis before (2012) and after SMC implementation
      (2014), respectively. In the non-SMC patient population 220/310 (71%) were
      successfully PCR analyzed. In the SMC children, the prevalence of all molecular
      markers of SP resistance increased significantly after SMC including the
      Pfdhfr-dhps quintuple mutant genotype, which was 1.6% before but 7.1% after SMC
      (p = 0.02). The prevalence of Pfmdr1-86Y significantly decreased from 26.7% to
      15.3% (p = 0.04) while no significant change was seen for Pfcrt 76T. In 2014,
      prevalence of all molecular markers of SP resistance were significantly higher
      among SMC children compared to the non-SMC population patient (p < 0.01). No
      Pfdhfr-164 mutation was found neither at baseline nor post SMC. CONCLUSION: SMC
      increased the prevalence of molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance to SP
      in the treated children. However, there was no significant increase of these
      markers of resistance in the general parasite population after 2 years and 7
      rounds of SMC.

AB  - Malaria remains a serious public health problem in Shandong Province, China;
      therefore, it is important to explore the characteristics of the current malaria 
      prevalence situation in the province. In this study, data of malaria cases
      reported in Shandong during 2012-2014 were analyzed, and Plasmodium species were 
      confirmed by smear microscopy and nested-PCR. A total of 374 malaria cases were
      reported, 80.8% of which were reported from 6 prefectures. Of all cases, P.
      falciparum was dominant (81.3%), followed by P. vivax (11.8%); P. ovale and P.
      malariae together accounted for 6.4% of cases. Notably, for the first time since 
      2012, no indigenous case had been reported in Shandong Province, a situation that
      continued through 2014. Total 95.2% of cases were imported from Africa. The ratio
      of male/female was 92.5:1, and 96.8% of cases occurred in people 20-54 years of
      age. Farmers or laborers represented 77.5% of cases. No significant trends of
      monthly pattern were found in the reported cases. All patients were in good
      condition after treatment, except for 3 who died. These results indicate that
      imported malaria has increased significantly since 2012 in Shandong Province,
      especially for P. falciparum, and there is an emergence of species diversity.

TI  - Hemozoin Pigment: An Important Tool for Low Parasitemic Malarial Diagnosis.
PG  - 393-7
LID - 10.3347/kjp.2016.54.4.393 [doi]
AB  - Low parasitemic condition in malaria remains a diagnostic challenge; as the
      available diagnostic methods failed to detect. Currently, hemozoin (Hz) pigment
      is gaining attention in the diagnosis of malaria. The major drawback is ease of
      detection of Hz in routine practice. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the 
      role of Hz pigment and to compare the performance of quantitative buffy coat
      assay (QBC) and PCR in such conditions. Clinically suspected cases of malaria
      were examined by both Giemsa stain and immunochromatographic test (ICT). Samples 
      positive by ICT and negative by Giemsa stain were further examined by nested PCR 
      targeting 18S rRNA and QBC for the presence of malaria parasites and pigments.
      Thirty blood samples fulfilled the inclusion criteria out of which 23 were
      Plasmodium vivax (Pv), 4 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), and 3 mixed (Pv and Pf) by
      immunochromatographic test. Twenty-one out of 30 (70%) were positive by nested
      PCR in comparison to 25/30 (83%) by QBC. Samples containing both malaria
      parasites and Hz pigment by QBC completely showed concordance with the PCR
      result. However, 61% of total samples containing only Hz pigment were observed
      positive by PCR. Hz pigment remains an important tool for malaria diagnosis.
      Identification of leukocytes containing pigments by QBC not only indicates recent
      malarial infections but also puts light on severity of the disease. QBC assay is 
      a rapid, highly sensitive, and cost-effective method to detect malaria parasites 
      and Hz pigment especially in low parasitemic conditions.

TI  - Geographic distribution of amino acid mutations in DHFR and DHPS in Plasmodium
      vivax isolates from Lao PDR, India and Colombia.
PG  - 484
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-synonymous mutations in dhfr and dhps genes in Plasmodium vivax
      are associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance. The present study 
      aimed to assess the prevalence of point mutations in P. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
      P. vivax dhps (pvdhps) genes in three countries: Lao PDR, India and Colombia.
      METHODS: Samples from 203 microscopically diagnosed vivax malaria were collected 
      from the three countries. Five codons at positions 13, 57, 58, 61, and 117 of
      pvdhfr and two codons at positions 383 and 553 of pvdhps were examined by
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.
      RESULTS: The largest number of 58R/117 N double mutations in pvdhfr was observed 
      in Colombia (94.3 %), while the corresponding wild-type amino acids were found at
      high frequencies in Lao PDR during 2001-2004 (57.8 %). Size polymorphism analysis
      of the tandem repeats within pvdhfr revealed that 74.3 % of all the isolates
      carried the type B variant. Eighty-nine per cent of all the isolates examined
      carried wild-type pvdhps A383 and A553. CONCLUSIONS: Although SP is not generally
      used to treat P. vivax infections, mutations in dhfr and dhps that confer
      antifolate resistance in P. vivax are common. The data strongly suggest that,
      when used primarily to treat falciparum malaria, SP can exert a substantial
      selective pressure on P. vivax populations, and this can lead to point mutations 
      in dhfr and dhps. Accurate data on the global geographic distribution of dhfr and
      dhps genotypes should help to inform anti-malarial drug-use policies.

TI  - Artemether-Lumefantrine versus Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for Treatment of
      Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in Children Aged Less than 15 Years
      in Guinea-Bissau - An Open-Label Non-Inferiority Randomised Clinical Trial.
PG  - e0161495
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was introduced for treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in Guinea-Bissau in 2008. Malaria then resurged and
      recurrent malaria after treatment with AL and stock-outs of AL were common. This 
      study therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of AL and identify an alternative
      second line antimalarial. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was chosen as it
      has been shown to be safe and efficacious and to reduce the incidence of
      recurrent malaria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a multicentre randomised open-label
      non-inferiority clinical trial, AL or DP were given over 3 days to children aged 
      6 months-15 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum mono-infection. Intake was
      observed and AL was given with milk. Children were seen on days 0, 1, 2 and 3 and
      then weekly days 7-42. Recurring P. falciparum were classified as recrudescence
      or new infections by genotyping. Between November 2012 and July 2015, 312
      children were randomised to AL (n = 155) or DP (n = 157). The day 42 PCR adjusted
      per protocol adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 95% and 100% in
      the AL and DP groups respectively, Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio (OR) 0.22 
      (95% CI 0-0.68), p = 0.022. In a modified intention to treat analysis in which
      treatment failures day 0 and reinfections were also considered as treatment
      failures adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 94% and 97% (OR
      0.42 [95% CI, 0.13-1.38], p = 0.15). Parasite clearance and symptom resolution
      were similar with both treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments achieved the WHO 
      recommended efficacy for antimalarials about to be adopted as policy. DP was not 
      inferior to AL for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in
      Guinea-Bissau. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NTC01704508.

TI  - Simple Molecular Methods for Early Detection of Chloroquine Drug Resistance in
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - DC19-23
LID - 10.7860/JCDR/2016/18596.8154 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malaria is a human disease of which causes high morbidity and
      mortality. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the resistance to antimalarial
      drugs, especially chloroquine (CQ) is one of the paramount factors contributing
      to the global increase in morbidity and mortality, due to malaria. Hence, there
      is a need for detection of chloroquine drug resistance genes i.e., pfcrt-o
      (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter-o) and pfmdr-1
      (Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance-1) of P. falciparum and pvcrt-o
      (Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance transporter-o) and pvmdr-1 (Plasmodium
      vivax multidrug resistance-1) of P. vivax by using molecular methods to prevent
      mortality in malarial cases. AIM: To standardize chloroquine drug sensitivity
      testing by molecular method so as to provide reports of chloroquine within 6-8
      hours to physicians for better treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was
      conducted over a period of one year from January to December 2014. A Total of 300
      blood samples were collected from malaria suspected patient attending MGM
      Hospital, Kamothe, Navi Mumbai, India. Out of 300 blood samples, 44 were malaria 
      positive as assessed by Thick and Thin blood smear stained, by Leishman's method 
      and examination with light microscope. Chloroquine drug sensitivity testing was
      performed using WHO III plate method (micro test). Nested PCR was done for
      detection of pfcrt-o and pfmdr-1 for P. falciparum and pvcrt-o, pvmdr-1 genes for
      P. vivax. RESULTS: Total 44 samples were included in this study, out of which 22 
      samples confirmed for Plasmodium falciparum and 22 samples confirmed for
      Plasmodium vivax. Out of 22 P. falciparum 15 (68.18%) samples were chloroquine
      resistant. P. vivax showed chloroquine resistance to 5 samples (22.73%) by method
      similar to WHO III plate method (micro test) and nested PCR. CONCLUSION: Drug
      resistance testing by molecular methods is useful for early detection of
      antimalarial drug resistance. pfmdr-1 along with pfcrt-o can be used as biomarker
      for chloroquine drug resistance in P. falciparum and pvmdr-1 along with pvcrt-o
      for P. vivax.

TI  - A Phase II pilot trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of ferroquine against
      early Plasmodium falciparum in an induced blood-stage malaria infection study.
PG  - 469
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1511-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ferroquine (SSR97193) is a candidate anti-malarial currently
      undergoing clinical trials for malaria. To better understand its pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters the compound was tested in the
      experimentally induced blood stage malaria infection model in volunteers.
      METHODS: Male and non-pregnant female aged 18-50 years were screened for this
      phase II, controlled, single-centre clinical trial. Subjects were inoculated with
      ~1800 viable Plasmodium falciparum 3D7A-infected human erythrocytes, and treated 
      with a single-dose of 800 mg ferroquine. Blood samples were taken at defined
      time-points to measure PK and PD parameters. The blood concentration of
      ferroquine and its active metabolite, SSR97213, were measured on dry blood spot
      samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). Parasitaemia and emergence of gametocytes were monitored by
      quantitative PCR. Safety was determined by recording adverse events and
      monitoring clinical laboratory assessments during the course of the study.
      RESULTS: Eight subjects were enrolled into the study, inoculated with infected
      erythrocytes and treated with 800 mg ferroquine. Ferroquine was rapidly absorbed 
      with maximal exposure after 4-8 and 4-12 h exposure for SSR97213.
      Non-compartmental PK analysis resulted in estimates for half-lives of 10.9 and
      23.8 days for ferroquine and SSR97213, respectively. Parasite clearance as
      reported by parasite reduction ratio was 162.9 (95 % CI 141-188) corresponding to
      a parasite clearance half-life of 6.5 h (95 % CI: 6.4-6.7 h). PK/PD modelling
      resulted in a predicted minimal parasiticidal concentration of 20 ng/mL, and the 
      single dosing tested in this study was predicted to maintain an exposure above
      this threshold for 454 h (37.8 days). Although ferroquine was overall well
      tolerated, transient elevated transaminase levels were observed in three
      subjects. Paracetamol was the only concomitant treatment among the two out of
      these three subjects that may have played a role in the elevated transaminases
      levels. No clinically significant ECG abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
      The parameters and PK/PD model derived from this study pave the way to the
      further rational development of ferroquine as an anti-malarial partner drug. The 
      safety of ferroquine has to be further explored in controlled human trials. Trial

      focused and more likely due to asymptomatic and non-falciparum infections. To
      inform malaria elimination planning in the context of this changing epidemiology,
      local assessments on the risk factors for malaria infection are necessary, yet
      challenging due to the low number of malaria cases. METHODS: A population-based, 
      cross-sectional study was performed using passive and active surveillance data
      collected in Aceh Besar District, Indonesia from 2014 to 2015. Malaria infection 
      was defined as symptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infection in
      index cases reported from health facilities, and asymptomatic or symptomatic
      PCR-confirmed infection identified in reactive case detection (RACD). Potential
      risk factors for any infection, species-specific infection, or secondary-case
      detection in RACD were assessed through questionnaires and evaluated for
      associations. RESULTS: Nineteen Plasmodium knowlesi, 12 Plasmodium vivax and six 
      Plasmodium falciparum cases were identified passively, and 1495 community members
      screened in RACD, of which six secondary cases were detected (one P. knowlesi,
      three P. vivax, and two P. falciparum, with four being asymptomatic). Compared to
      non-infected subjects screened in RACD, cases identified through passive or
      active surveillance were more likely to be male (AOR 12.5, 95 % CI 3.0-52.1),
      adult (AOR 14.0, 95 % CI 2.2-89.6 for age 16-45 years compared to <15 years),
      have visited the forest in the previous month for any reason (AOR 5.6, 95 % CI
      1.3-24.2), and have a workplace near or in the forest and requiring overnight
      stays (AOR 7.9, 95 % CI 1.6-39.7 compared to workplace not near or in the
      forest). Comparing subjects with infections of different species, differences
      were observed in sub-district of residence and other demographic and behavioural 
      factors. Among subjects screened in RACD, cases compared to non-cases were more
      likely to be febrile and reside within 100 m of the index case. CONCLUSION: In
      this setting, risk of malaria infection in index and RACD identified cases was
      associated with forest exposure, particularly overnights in the forest for work. 
      In low-transmission settings, utilization of data available through routine
      passive and active surveillance can support efforts to target individuals at high
      risk.

TI  - Multi-method assessment of patients with febrile illness reveals over-diagnosis
      of malaria in rural Uganda.
PG  - 460
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1502-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health clinics in rural Africa are typically resource-limited. As a
      result, many patients presenting with fever are treated with anti-malarial drugs 
      based only on clinical presentation. This is a considerable issue in Uganda,
      where malaria is routinely over-diagnosed and over-treated, constituting a
      wastage of resources and an elevated risk of mortality in wrongly diagnosed
      patients. However, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria are increasingly
      being used in health facilities. Being fast, easy and inexpensive, RDTs offer the
      opportunity for feasible diagnostic capacity in resource-limited areas. This
      study evaluated the rate of malaria misdiagnosis and the accuracy of RDTs in
      rural Uganda, where presumptive diagnosis still predominates. Specifically, the
      diagnostic accuracy of "gold standard" methods, microscopy and PCR, were compared
      to the most feasible method, RDTs. METHODS: Patients presenting with fever at one
      of two health clinics in the Kabarole District of Uganda were enrolled in this
      study. Blood was collected by finger prick and used to administer RDTs, make
      blood smears for microscopy, and blot Whatman FTA cards for DNA extraction,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and sequencing. The accuracy of
      RDTs and microscopy were assessed relative to PCR, considered the new standard of
      malaria diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were enrolled, and 31 were
      diagnosed with Plasmodium infection by at least one method. Comparing diagnostic 
      pairs determined that RDTs and microscopy performed similarly, being 92.6 and
      92.0 % sensitive and 95.5 and 94.4 % specific, respectively. Combining both
      methods resulted in a sensitivity of 96.0 % and specificity of 100 %. However,
      both RDTs and microscopy missed one case of non-falciparum malaria (Plasmodium
      malariae) that was identified and characterized by PCR and sequencing. In total, 
      based on PCR, 62.0 % of patients would have been misdiagnosed with malaria if
      symptomatic diagnosis was used. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that diagnosis of
      malaria based on symptoms alone appears to be highly inaccurate in this setting. 
      Furthermore, RDTs were very effective at diagnosing malaria, performing as well
      or better than microscopy. However, only PCR and DNA sequencing detected non-P.
      falciparum species, which highlights an important limitation of this test and a
      treatment concern for non-falciparum malaria patients. Nevertheless, RDTs appear 
      the only feasible method in rural or resource-limited areas, and therefore offer 
      the best way forward in malaria management in endemic countries.

TI  - In vivo efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria: an open-randomized,
      non-inferiority clinical trial in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo.
PG  - 455

AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 2009 and 2012, malaria cases diagnosed in a Medecins sans
      Frontieres programme have increased fivefold in Baraka, South Kivu, Democratic
      Republic of the Congo (DRC). The cause of this increase is not known. An in vivo 
      drug efficacy trial was conducted to determine whether increased treatment
      failure rates may have contributed to the apparent increase in malaria diagnoses.
      METHODS: In an open-randomized non-inferiority trial, the efficacy of
      artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) was compared to artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for
      the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in 288 children aged 6-59
      months. Included children had directly supervised treatment and were then
      followed for 42 days with weekly clinical and parasitological evaluations. The
      blood samples of children found to have recurring parasitaemia within 42 days
      were checked by PCR to confirm whether or not this was due to reinfection or
      recrudescence (i.e. treatment failure). RESULTS: Out of 873 children screened,
      585 (67 %) were excluded and 288 children were randomized to either ASAQ or AL.
      At day 42 of follow up, the treatment efficacy of ASAQ was 78 % before and 95 %
      after PCR correction for re-infections. In the AL-arm, treatment efficacy was 84 
      % before and 99.0 % after PCR correction. Treatment efficacy after PCR correction
      was within the margin of non-inferiority as set for this study. Fewer children in
      the AL arm reported adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: ASAQ is still effective as a 
      treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Baraka, South Kivu, DRC. In this region,
      AL may have higher efficacy but additional trials are required to draw this
      conclusion with confidence. The high re-infection rate in South-Kivu indicates
      intense malaria transmission. Trial registration NCT02741024.

TI  - Selection of Plasmodium falciparum pfcrt and pfmdr1 polymorphisms after treatment
      with artesunate-amodiaquine fixed dose combination or artemether-lumefantrine in 
      Liberia.
PG  - 452
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1503-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria can successfully be
      treated with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). However resistance
      is spreading to the different ACT compounds; the artemisinin derivative and the
      partner drug. Studies of P. falciparum polymorphisms associated with drug
      resistance can provide a useful tool to track resistance and guide treatment
      policy as well as an in-depth understanding of the development and spread of
      resistance. METHODS: The role of P. falciparum molecular markers in selection of 
      reinfections was assessed in an efficacy trial comparing artesunate-amodiaquine
      fixed-dose combination with artemether-lumefantrine to treat malaria in Nimba
      County, Liberia 2008-2009. P. falciparum polymorphisms in pfcrt 76, pfmdr1 86,
      184 and 1246, and pfmrp1 876 and 1466 were analysed by PCR-RFLP and
      pyrosequencing. RESULTS: High baseline prevalence of pfmdr1 1246Y was found in
      Nimba county (38 %). Pfmdr1 1246Y and pfmdr1 86+184+1246 haplotypes NYY and YYY
      were selected in reinfections in the artesunate-amodiaquine arm and pfcrt K76,
      pfmdr1 N86 and pfmdr1 haplotype NFD were selected in artemether-lumefantrine
      reinfections. Parasites harbouring pfmdr1 1246Y could reinfect earlier after
      treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine and parasites carrying pfmdr1 N86 could
      reinfect at higher lumefantrine concentrations in patients treated with
      artemether-lumefantrine. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment is highly efficacious,
      selection of molecular markers in reinfections could indicate a decreased
      sensitivity or tolerance of parasites to the current treatments and the baseline 
      prevalence of molecular markers should be closely monitored. Since individual
      drug levels and the day of reinfection were demonstrated to be key determinants
      for selection of reinfections, this data needs to be collected and taken into
      account for accurate evaluation of molecular markers for anti-malarial
      treatments. The protocols for the clinical trial was registered with Current
      Controlled Trials, under the Identifier Number ISRCTN51688713 on 9 October 2008.

TI  - Assessing the asymptomatic reservoir and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      effectiveness in a low transmission setting threatened by artemisinin resistant
      Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 446

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Cambodia, elimination of artemisinin resistance through direct
      elimination of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite may be the only strategy.
      Prevalence and incidence at district and village levels were assessed in Chey
      Saen district, Preah Vihear province, North of Cambodia. Molecular and clinical
      indicators for artemisinin resistance were documented. METHODS: A cross sectional
      prevalence survey was conducted at village level in the district of Chey Saen
      from September to October 2014. Plasmodium spp. was assessed with high volume
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Plasmodium
      falciparum-positive samples were screened for mutations in the k13-propeller
      domain gene. Treatment effectiveness was established after 28 days (D28) using
      the same qPCR technique. Data from the provincial surveillance system targeting
      symptomatic cases, supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), were used to
      assess incidence. RESULTS: District P. falciparum prevalence was of 0.74 % [0.41;
      1.21]; village prevalence ranged from 0 to 4.6 % [1.4; 10.5]. The annual
      incidence of P. falciparum was 16.8 cases per 1000 inhabitants in the district;
      village incidence ranged from 1.3 to 54.9 for 1000 inhabitants. Two geographical 
      clusters with high number of cases were identified by both approaches. The marker
      for artemisinin resistance was found in six samples out of the 11 tested (55 %). 
      34.9 % of qPCR blood analysis of symptomatic patients were still positive at D28.
      CONCLUSIONS: The overall low prevalence of P. falciparum was confirmed in Chey
      Saen district in Cambodia, while there were important variations between
      villages. Symptomatic cases had a different pattern and were likely acquired
      outside the villages. It illustrates the importance of prevalence surveys in
      targeting interventions for elimination. Mutations in the k13-propeller domain
      gene (C580Y), conferring artemisinin resistance, were highly prevalent in both
      symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (realizing the absolute figures remain low).
      Asymptomatic individuals could be an additional reservoir for artemisinin
      resistance. The low effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) for
      symptomatic cases indicates that PPQ is no longer able to complement the reduced 
      potency of DHA to treat falciparum malaria and highlights the need for an
      alternative first-line treatment.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax have evolved with host switches
      between non-human primates (NHPs) and humans. Studies on the infection dynamics
      of Plasmodium species in NHPs will improve our understanding of the evolution of 
      these parasites; however, such studies are hampered by the difficulty of handling
      animals in the field. The aim of this study was to detect genomic DNA of
      Plasmodium species from the faeces of New World monkeys. Faecal samples from 23
      Alouatta clamitans from the Centre for Biological Research of Indaial (Santa
      Catarina, Brazil) were collected. Extracted DNA from faecal samples was used for 
      molecular diagnosis of malaria by nested polymerase chain reaction. One natural
      infection with Plasmodium simium was identified by amplification of DNA extracted
      from the faeces of A. clamitans. Extracted DNA from a captive NHP was also used
      for parasite genotyping. The detection limit of the technique was evaluated in
      vitro using an artificial mixture of cultured P. falciparum in NHP faeces and
      determined to be 6.5 parasites/microL. Faecal samples of New World primates can
      be used to detect malaria infections in field surveys and also to monitor the
      genetic variability of parasites and dynamics of infection.

TI  - Prevalence of malaria in pregnancy in southern Laos: a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 436
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1492-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no data on the burden of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) in
      Laos, where malaria still remains prevalent in the south. METHODS: Two
      cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2014 to assess the prevalence of MiP in
      Vapi District, Salavan Province, southern Laos: the first consisted of screening 
      204 pregnant women during pregnancies [mean (95 % CI) gestational age: 23 (22-25)
      weeks] living in 30 randomly selected villages in Vapi District; the second was
      conducted among 331 pregnant women, who delivered during the study period in Vapi
      and Toumlane District Hospitals and in Salavan Provincial Hospital. Peripheral
      and placental malaria was detected using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), thick
      blood smears (TBS) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions
      (RT-qPCR). Factors associated with low birth weight (LBW) and maternal anaemia
      were assessed. RESULTS: In the villages, 12/204 women (5.9 %; 95 % CI 3.1-10.0)
      were infected with malaria as determined by RT-qPCR: 11 were Plasmodium vivax
      infections and 1 was mixed Plasmodium vivax/Plasmodium falciparum infection,
      among which 9 were sub-microscopic (as not detected by TBS). History of malaria
      during current pregnancy tended to be associated with a higher risk of MiP (aIRR 
      3.05; 95 % CI 0.94-9.88). At delivery, two Plasmodium falciparum sub-microscopic 
      infections (one peripheral and one placental) were detected (4.5 %; 0.6-15.5) in 
      Vapi District. In both surveys, all infected women stated they had slept under a 
      bed net the night before the survey, and 86 % went to the forest for food-finding
      1 week before the survey in median. The majority of infections (94 %) were
      asymptomatic and half of them were associated with anaemia. Overall, 24 % of
      women had LBW newborns. Factors associated with a higher risk of LBW were tobacco
      use (aIRR 2.43; 95 % CI 1.64-3.60) and pre-term delivery (aIRR 3.17; 95 % CI
      2.19-4.57). Factors associated with a higher risk of maternal anaemia were no
      iron supplementation during pregnancy, Lao Theung ethnicity and place of living. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MiP in this population was noticeable. Most
      infections were asymptomatic and sub-microscopic vivax malaria, which raises the 
      question of reliability of recommended national strategies for the screening and 
      prevention of MiP in Laos.

TI  - Adding a single low-dose of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg) to artemether-lumefantrine
      did not compromise treatment outcome of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in Tanzania: a randomized, single-blinded clinical trial.
PG  - 435
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1430-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended the addition
      of a single low-dose of the gametocytocidal drug primaquine (PQ) to
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in low transmission settings as a
      component of pre-elimination or elimination programmes. However, it is unclear
      whether that influences the ACT cure rate. The study assessed treatment outcome
      of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) plus a single PQ dose (0.25 mg/kg) versus
      standard AL regimen for treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in Tanzania. METHODS: A randomized, single-blinded, clinical trial was
      conducted in Yombo, Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Acute uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria patients aged >/=1 year, with the exception of pregnant and
      lactating women, were enrolled and treated with AL plus a single PQ dose (0.25
      mg/kg) or AL alone under supervision. PQ was administered together with the first
      AL dose. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, 
      60, and 72 h and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The primary end-point was a
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological
      response (ACPR) on day 28. Secondary outcomes included: fever and asexual
      parasitaemia clearance, proportion of patients with PCR-determined parasitaemia
      on day 3, and proportion of patients with Pfmdr1 N86Y and Pfcrt K76T on days 0, 3
      and day of recurrent infection. RESULTS: Overall 220 patients were enrolled, 110 
      were allocated AL + PQ and AL, respectively. Parasite clearance by microscopy was
      fast, but PCR detectable parasitaemia on day 3 was 31/109 (28.4 %) and 29/108
      (26.9 %) in patients treated with AL + PQ and AL, respectively (p = 0.79). Day 28
      PCR-adjusted ACPR and re-infection rate was 105/105 (100 %) and 101/102 (99 %) (p
      = 0.31), and 5/107 (4.7 %) and 5/8 (4.8 %) (p = 0.95), in AL + PQ and AL arm,
      respectively. There was neither any statistically significant difference in the
      proportion of Pfmdr1 N86Y or Pfcrt K76T between treatment arms on days 0, 3 and

AB  - In the Union of Comoros, interventions for combating malaria have contributed to 
      a spectacular decrease in the prevalence of the disease. We studied the current
      distribution of Plasmodium species on the island of Grande Comore using nested
      PCR. The rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) currently used in the Comoros are able to 
      identify Plasmodium falciparum but no other Plasmodium species. In this study, we
      tested 211 RDTs (158 positive and 53 negative). Among the 158 positive RDTs, 22
      were positive for HRP2, 3 were positive only for pLDH, and 133 were positive for 
      HRP2 and pLDH. DNA was extracted from a proximal part of the nitrocellulose
      membrane of RDTs. A total of 159 samples were positive by nested PCR. Of those,
      156 (98.11%) were positive for P. falciparum, 2 (1.25%) were positive for P.
      vivaxI, and 1 (0.62%) was positive for P. malariae. None of the samples were
      positive for P. ovale. Our results show that P. falciparum is still the most
      dominant species on the island of Grande Comore, but P. vivax and P. malariae are
      present at a low prevalence.

TI  - Non-falciparum malaria in Dakar: a confirmed case of Plasmodium ovale wallikeri
      infection.
PG  - 429
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1485-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is rarely described in Senegal. A case of clinical
      malaria due to P. ovale wallikeri in West Central of Senegal is reported. CASE: A
      34-year-old male baker in Dakar, with no significant previous medical history,
      was admitted to a health clinic with fever and vomiting. Fever had been lasting
      for 4 days with peaks every 48 h. As monospecific Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 RDT
      was negative, he was treated with antibiotics. However, owing to persisting
      symptoms, he was referred to the emergency unit of the Youssou Mbargane Diop
      Hospital, Dakar, Senegal. Clinical examination found impaired general condition. 
      All other physical examinations were normal. Laboratory tests showed anaemia
      (haemoglobin 11.4 g/dl), severe thrombocytopaenia (platelets 30 x 10(9)/mm(3)),
      leukopenia (3650/mm(3)), lymphocytopenia (650/mm(3)). Renal function was normal
      as indicated by creatininaemia and uraemia (11 mg/l and 0.25 g/l, respectively)
      and liver enzymes were slightly elevated (aspartate aminotransferase 77 UI/l and 
      alanine aminotransferase 82 UI/l). Blood smear evaluations in Parasitology
      Laboratory of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital showed malaria parasites of the species
      P. ovale with a 0.08 % parasitaemia. Molecular confirmation was done by real time
      PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene. The P. ovale infection was further analysed to
      species level targeting the potra gene and was identified as P. ovale wallikeri. 
      According to the hospital's malaria treatment guidelines for severe malaria,
      treatment consisted of intravenous quinine at hour 0 (start of treatment) and 24 
      h after initial treatment, followed by artemether-lumefantrine 24 h later. A
      negative microscopy was noted on day 3 post-treatment and the patient reported no
      further symptoms. CONCLUSION: Malaria due to non-falciparum species is probably
      underestimated in Senegal. RDTs specific to non-falciparum species and/or pan
      specific RDTs should be included as tools of diagnosis to fight against malaria
      in Senegal. In addition, a field-deployable molecular tool such as the
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification can be considered as an additional useful 
      tool to detect low malaria parasite infections and for speciation. In addition,
      national malaria control policies should consider other non-falciparum species in
      treatment guidelines, including the provision of primaquine for the treatment of 
      relapsing parasites.

PG  - 425
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1468-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria exerts a tremendous socioeconomic impact worldwide despite
      current control efforts, and novel disease transmission-blocking strategies are
      urgently needed. The Enterobacter bacterium Esp_Z, which is naturally harboured
      in the mosquito midgut, can inhibit the development of Plasmodium parasites prior
      to their invasion of the midgut epithelium through a mechanism that involves
      oxidative stress. Here, a multifaceted approach is used to study the tripartite
      interactions between the mosquito, Esp_Z and Plasmodium, towards addressing the
      feasibility of using sugar-baited exposure of mosquitoes to the Esp_Z bacterium
      for interruption of malaria transmission. METHODS: The ability of Esp_Z to
      colonize Anopheles gambiae midguts harbouring microbiota derived from wild
      mosquitoes was determined by qPCR. Upon introduction of Esp_Z via nectar feeding,
      the permissiveness of colonized mosquitoes to Plasmodium falciparum infection was
      determined, as well as the impact of Esp_Z on mosquito fitness parameters, such
      as longevity, number of eggs laid and number of larvae hatched. The genome of
      Esp_Z was sequenced, and transcriptome analyses were performed to identify
      bacterial genes that are important for colonization of the mosquito midgut, as
      well as for ROS-production. A gene expression analysis of members of the
      oxidative defence pathway of Plasmodium berghei was also conducted to assess the 
      parasite's oxidative defence response to Esp_Z exposure. RESULTS: Esp_Z persisted
      for up to 4 days in the An. gambiae midgut after introduction via nectar feeding,
      and was able to significantly inhibit Plasmodium sporogonic development.
      Introduction of this bacterium did not adversely affect mosquito fitness.
      Candidate genes involved in the selection of a better fit Esp_Z to the mosquito
      midgut environment and in its ability to condition oxidative status of its
      surroundings were identified, and parasite expression data indicated that Esp_Z
      is able to induce a partial and temporary shutdown of the ookinetes antioxidant
      response. CONCLUSIONS: Esp_Z is capable of inhibiting sporogonic development of
      Plasmodium in the presence of the mosquito's native microbiota without affecting 
      mosquito fitness. Several candidate bacterial genes are likely mediating midgut
      colonization and ROS production, and inhibition of Plasmodium development appears
      to involve a shutdown of the parasite's oxidative defence system. A better
      understanding of the complex reciprocal tripartite interactions can facilitate
      the development and optimization of an Esp_Z-based malaria control strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of an effective vaccine, malaria treatment and
      eradication is still a challenge in most endemic areas globally. This is
      especially the case with the current reported emergence of resistance to
      artemisinin agents in Southeast Asia. This study therefore explored the
      prevalence of K13-propeller gene polymorphisms among Plasmodium falciparum
      parasites in northern Uganda. METHODS: Adult patients (>/=18 years) presenting to
      out-patients department of Lira and Gulu regional referral hospitals in northern 
      Uganda were randomly recruited. Laboratory investigation for presence of
      plasmodium infection among patients was done using Plasmodium falciparum
      exclusive rapid diagnostic test, histidine rich protein-2 (HRP2) (Pf). Finger
      prick capillary blood from patients with a positive malaria test was spotted on a
      filter paper Whatman no. 903. The parasite DNA was extracted using chelex resin
      method and sequenced for mutations in K13-propeller gene using Sanger sequencing.
      PCR DNA sequence products were analyzed using in DNAsp 5.10.01software, data was 
      further processed in Excel spreadsheet 2007. RESULTS: A total of 60 parasite DNA 
      samples were sequenced. Polymorphisms in the K13-propeller gene were detected in 
      four (4) of the 60 parasite DNA samples sequenced. A non-synonymous polymorphism 
      at codon 533 previously detected in Cambodia was found in the parasite DNA
      samples analyzed. Polymorphisms at codon 522 (non-synonymous) and codon 509
      (synonymous) were also found in the samples analyzed. The study found evidence of
      positive selection in the Plasmodium falciparum population in northern Uganda
      (Tajima's D = -1.83205; Fu and Li's D = -1.82458). CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism in
      the K13-propeller gene previously reported in Cambodia has been found in the
      Ugandan Plasmodium falciparum parasites. There is need for continuous
      surveillance for artemisinin resistance gene markers in the country.

TI  - Assessment of submicroscopic infections and gametocyte carriage of Plasmodium
      falciparum during peak malaria transmission season in a community-based
      cross-sectional survey in western Kenya, 2012.
PG  - 421

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although malaria control intervention has greatly decreased malaria
      morbidity and mortality in many African countries, further decline in parasite
      prevalence has stagnated in western Kenya. In order to assess if malaria
      transmission reservoir is associated with this stagnation, submicroscopic
      infection and gametocyte carriage was estimated. Risk factors and associations
      between malaria control interventions and gametocyte carriage were further
      investigated in this study. METHODS: A total of 996 dried blood spot samples were
      used from two strata, all smear-positives (516 samples) and randomly selected
      smear-negatives (480 samples), from a community cross-sectional survey conducted 
      at peak transmission season in 2012 in Siaya County, western Kenya. Plasmodium
      falciparum parasite presence and density were determined by stained blood smear
      and by 18S mRNA transcripts using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay
      (NASBA), gametocyte presence and density were determined by blood smear and by
      Pfs25 mRNA-NASBA, and gametocyte diversity by Pfg377 mRNA RT-PCR and RT-qPCR.
      RESULTS: Of the randomly selected smear-negative samples, 69.6 % (334/480) were
      positive by 18S-NASBA while 18S-NASBA detected 99.6 % (514/516) smear positive
      samples. Overall, 80.2 % of the weighted population was parasite positive by
      18S-NASBA vs 30.6 % by smear diagnosis and 44.0 % of the weighted population was 
      gametocyte positive by Pfs25-NASBA vs 2.6 % by smear diagnosis. Children 5-15
      years old were more likely to be parasitaemic and gametocytaemic by NASBA than
      individuals >15 years old or children <5 years old while gametocyte density
      decreased with age. Anaemia and self-reported fever within the past 24 h were
      associated with increased odds of gametocytaemia. Fever was also positively
      associated with parasite density, but not with gametocyte density. Anti-malarial 
      use within the past 2 weeks decreased the odds of gametocytaemia, but not the
      odds of parasitaemia. In contrast, recent anti-malarial use was associated with
      lowered parasite density, but not the gametocyte density. Use of ITNs was
      associated with lower odds for parasitaemia in part of the study area with a
      longer history of ITN interventions. In the same part of study area, the odds of 
      having multiple gametocyte alleles were also lower in individuals using ITNs than
      in those not using ITNs and parasite density was positively associated with
      gametocyte diversity. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of submicroscopic parasites 
      and gametocytes in western Kenya might contribute to the stagnation in malaria
      prevalence, suggesting that additional interventions targeting the infectious
      reservoir are needed. As school aged children and persons with anaemia and fever 
      were major sources for gametocyte reservoir, these groups should be targeted for 
      intervention and prevention to reduce malaria transmission. Anti-malarial use was
      associated with lower parasite density and odds of gametocytaemia, but not the
      gametocyte density, indicating a limitation of anti-malarial impact on the
      transmission reservoir. ITN use had a protective role against parasitaemia and
      gametocyte diversity in western Kenya.

TI  - Malaria in urban, semi-urban and rural areas of southern of Gabon: comparison of 
      the Pfmdr 1 and Pfcrt genotypes from symptomatic children.
PG  - 420
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1469-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are
      first- and second-line treatments for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      in Gabon. AL remains highly efficacious, but its widespread use has led to
      molecular selection of the NFD haplotype on Pfmdr1 and K76 in Pfcrt. In this
      study, plasmodial infection characteristics and the distribution of the Pfmdr1
      and Pfcrt genotypes involved in reduced efficacy of artemisinin-based combination
      therapy (ACT) were investigated in four Gabonese localities. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted in the paediatric units of rural
      (Lastourville and Fougamou), semi-urban (Koula-Moutou) and urban (Franceville)
      areas. Malaria was diagnosed with the rapid diagnostic test Optimal-IT((R)) and
      confirmed by blood smear. Pfmdr1 codons 86, 184 and 1246 and Pfcrt codon 76 were 
      genotyped by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. RESULTS: Among 1129 included children, the 
      prevalence of plasmodial infection was 79.5 % at Lastourville, 53.6 % at
      Fougamou, 36.1 % at Koula-Moutou, and 21.2 % at Franceville. The prevalence was
      significantly higher among children over 60 months of age in both semi-urban (p =
      0.01) and urban (p = 0.004) areas. The prevalence of Pfmdr1 wild-type N86
      differed significantly between Lastourville (57.8 %) and Koula-Moutou (45.4 %) (p
      = 0.039). No difference in 184F-carrying parasites was found between Lastourville
      (73.8 %), Fougamou (81.6 %), Koula-Moutou (83.2 %), and Franceville (80.6 %) (p =
      0.240). The prevalence of wild-type D1246 was significantly different between
      Lastourville (94.1 %), Koula-Moutou (85.6 %) and Franceville (87.3 %) (p = 0.01).
      The frequency of wild-type K76 was not significantly different across the four
      sites: Lastourville (16.5 %), Fougamou (27.8 %), Koula-Moutou (17.4 %), and
      Franceville (29.4 %) (p = 0.09). The mixed genotypes were only found in
      Lastourville and Franceville. The NFD, YFD and NYD haplotypes were mainly
      Lastourville (46.6, 25.8, 14.0 %), Fougamou (45.5, 9.1, 42.4 %), Koula-Moutou
      (35, 6.7, 40.4 %), and Franceville (40.0, 16.0, 32.0 %). CONCLUSION: This study
      shows an increase in the prevalence of childhood plasmodial infection in Gabon
      according to the low socio-economic level, and a high frequency of markers
      associated with AL treatment failure. Close monitoring of ACT use is needed.
