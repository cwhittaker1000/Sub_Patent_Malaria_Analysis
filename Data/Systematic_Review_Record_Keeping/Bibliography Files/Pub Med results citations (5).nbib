TI  - First insights into the metagenome of Egyptian mummies using next-generation
      sequencing.

AB  - We applied, for the first time, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology on
      Egyptian mummies. Seven NGS datasets obtained from five randomly selected Third
      Intermediate to Graeco-Roman Egyptian mummies (806 BC-124AD) and two unearthed
      pre-contact Bolivian lowland skeletons were generated and characterised. The
      datasets were contrasted to three recently published NGS datasets obtained from
      cold-climate regions, i.e. the Saqqaq, the Denisova hominid and the Alpine
      Iceman. Analysis was done using one million reads of each newly generated or
      published dataset. Blastn and megablast results were analysed using MEGAN
      software. Distinct NGS results were replicated by specific and sensitive
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols in ancient DNA dedicated laboratories. 
      Here, we provide unambiguous identification of authentic DNA in Egyptian mummies.
      The NGS datasets showed variable contents of endogenous DNA harboured in tissues.
      Three of five mummies displayed a human DNA proportion comparable to the human
      read count of the Saqqaq permafrost-preserved specimen. Furthermore, a
      metagenomic signature unique to mummies was displayed. By applying a "bacterial
      fingerprint", discrimination among mummies and other remains from warm areas
      outside Egypt was possible. Due to the absence of an adequate environment
      monitoring, a bacterial bloom was identified when analysing different biopsies
      from the same mummies taken after a lapse of time of 1.5 years. Plant kingdom
      representation in all mummy datasets was unique and could be partially associated
      with their use in embalming materials. Finally, NGS data showed the presence of
      Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii DNA sequences, indicating malaria and
      toxoplasmosis in these mummies. We demonstrate that endogenous ancient DNA can be
      extracted from mummies and serve as a proper template for the NGS technique,
      thus, opening new pathways of investigation for future genome sequencing of
      ancient Egyptian individuals.

AB  - Genome sequences are available for 3 human-infecting malaria parasites,
      Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, and population genomics data are
      available for many endemic regions. This review summarizes how genomic data have 
      been used to develop new, species-specific molecular targets for better malaria
      diagnosis. The combination of bioinformatics and genomics has been used to
      identify new sequence targets suitable for diagnostic applications and assess
      their viability within the context of global Plasmodium sequence variation. The
      selection criteria maximized the sensitivity and specificity of the novel
      targets. At least one target from each species was found to be suitable for
      molecular diagnosis of malaria with some advantages over existing molecular
      methods. The promise of using genome sequence data to develop sensitive, genus-
      or species-specific diagnostic methods for other pathogens of public health
      interest is strong. This undertaking together with what we envision as the future
      of malaria diagnosis in the 'omic' era is discussed.

AB  - Microsatellites have been increasingly used to investigate the population
      structure of malaria parasites, to map genetic loci contributing to phenotypes
      such as drug resistance and virulence in laboratory crosses and genome-wide
      association studies and to distinguish between treatment failures and new
      infections in clinical trials. Here, we provide optimized protocols for
      genotyping highly polymorphic microsatellites sampled from across the genomes of 
      the human malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax that have been
      extensively used in research laboratories worldwide.

TI  - 16S rRNA gene-based identification of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica
      (Flavobacteriales: Flavobacteriaceae) as a dominant midgut bacterium of the Asian
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi (Dipteria: Culicidae) with antimicrobial
      activities.
PG  - 404-14
AB  - Following their transmission from the human to the mosquito with the bloodmeal,
      malaria parasites have to persevere in the mosquito midgut for approximately 1 d.
      During this period the parasites are highly vulnerable to factors of the mosquito
      midgut, including bacteria. We here aimed at determining the microbial diversity 
      of gut bacteria of the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi (Liston) during
      development and under different feeding regimes, including feeds on malaria
      parasite-infected blood. 16S rRNA and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
      analyses demonstrated an increasing reduction in the microbial diversity during
      mosquito development from egg to adult and identified the gram-negative bacterium
      Elizabethkingia meningoseptica King as the dominant species in the midgut of
      lab-reared male and female mosquitoes. E. meningoseptica is transmitted between
      generations and its predominance in the mosquito midgut was not altered by diet, 
      when the gut microbiota was compared between sugar-fed and blood-fed female
      mosquitoes. Furthermore, feeds on blood infected with malaria parasites did not
      impact the presence of E. meningoseptica in the gut. Extracts from cultured E.
      meningoseptica were active against gram-positive and negative bacteria and yeast 
      and against the blood and gametocyte transmission stages of the malaria parasite 
      Plasmodium falciparum Welch. The antimicrobial and antiplasmodial activities of
      E. meningoseptica may account for its dominance in the midgut of the malaria
      vector.

TI  - Relationship between alpha+-thalassaemia and glutathione-S-transferases
      polymorphisms in children with severe malaria in Tanzania.
PG  - 82-7
AB  - Alpha+-thalassaemia is well known for conferring partial protection to severe
      malaria. On the other, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) polymorphism has recently 
      been associated to severe malaria in children. A retrospective cross sectional
      study was carried out to determine the relationship between genotypic
      polymorphisms of alpha+-thalassaemia and glutathione-S-transferase in children
      with severe malaria. A total of 148 DNA samples from children aged between 3 and 
      15 years with mild and severe malaria were retrieved and determined by polymerase
      chain reaction. Children with Glutathione-S-transferase-pil (GSTP1)-polymorphism 
      were observed to have three fold risk (OR = 2.9; 95% CI =1.3- 6.1; P = 0.006) of 
      developing severe malaria compared to mild malaria in Mnyuzi in Korogwe District,
      north-eastern, Tanzania. In the presence of Glutathione-S-transferase-pil
      polymorphism, children were found to have 3% decreased protective effect of
      alpha+-thalassaemia polymorphisms (homozygotes and heterozygotes) against severe 
      malaria although this was not statistically significant [OR = 0.81 (95% CI =
      0.5-1.5; P = 0.5) to OR =0.78(95% CI = 0.4-1.5; P = 0.44)]. We conclude that
      Glutathione-S-transferase-pil polymorphism increases risk of developing severe
      malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in children. The observed inverse
      relationship between GSTP1 polymorphisms and alpha-thalassaemia to children with 
      severe malaria need further investigation.

TI  - Genetic diversity and signatures of selection of drug resistance in Plasmodium
      populations from both human and mosquito hosts in continental Equatorial Guinea.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Plasmodium, the high level of genetic diversity and the
      interactions established by co-infecting parasite populations within the same
      host may be a source of selection on pathogen virulence and drug resistance. As
      different patterns have already been described in humans and mosquitoes, parasite
      diversity and population structure should be studied in both hosts to properly
      assess their effects on infection and transmission dynamics. This study aimed to 
      characterize the circulating populations of Plasmodium spp and Plasmodium
      falciparum from a combined set of human blood and mosquito samples gathered in
      mainland Equatorial Guinea. Further, the origin and evolution of anti-malarial
      resistance in this area, where malaria remains a major public health problem were
      traced. METHODS: Plasmodium species infecting humans and mosquitoes were
      identified by nested-PCR of chelex-extracted DNA from dried blood spot samples
      and mosquitoes. Analysis of Pfmsp2 gene, anti-malarial-resistance associated
      genes, Pfdhps, Pfdhfr, Pfcrt and Pfmdr1, neutral microsatellites (STR) loci and
      Pfdhfr and Pfdhps flanking STR was undertaken to evaluate P. falciparum
      diversity. RESULTS: Prevalence of infection remains high in mainland Equatorial
      Guinea. No differences in parasite formula or significant genetic differentiation
      were seen in the parasite populations in both human and mosquito samples. Point
      mutations in all genes associated with anti-malarial resistance were highly
      prevalent. A high prevalence was observed for the Pfdhfr triple mutant in
      particular, associated with pyrimethamine resistance.Analysis of Pfdhps and
      Pfdhfr flanking STR revealed a decrease in the genetic diversity. This finding
      along with multiple independent introductions of Pfdhps mutant haplotypes suggest
      a soft selective sweep and an increased differentiation at Pfdhfr flanking
      microsatellites hints a model of positive directional selection for this gene.
      CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine is no longer recommended for malaria treatment in
      Equatorial Guinea but sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) remains in use in
      combination with artesunate and is the only drug recommended in preventive
      chemotherapy in pregnancy. The high prevalence of point mutations in Pfdhfr and
      Pfdhps points to the danger of an eventual reduction in the efficacy of SP
      combined therapy in P. falciparum populations in Equatorial Guinea and to the
      essential continuous monitoring of these two genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is a candidate target for the
      development of blood stage vaccines against malaria. Polymorphism in MSP-1 can be
      useful as a genetic marker for strain differentiation in malarial parasites.
      Although sequence diversity in the MSP-1 locus has been extensively analyzed in
      field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, the extent of variation in 
      its homologues in P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri, remains unknown.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
      sequences of 10 P. ovale isolates from symptomatic malaria patients from diverse 
      endemic areas of Thailand revealed co-existence of P. ovale curtisi (n = 5) and
      P. ovale wallikeri (n = 5). Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified products
      encompassing the entire coding region of MSP-1 of P. ovale curtisi (PocMSP-1) and
      P. ovale wallikeri (PowMSP-1) has identified 3 imperfect repeated segments in the
      former and one in the latter. Most amino acid differences between these proteins 
      were located in the interspecies variable domains of malarial MSP-1. Synonymous
      nucleotide diversity (piS) exceeded nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (piN) for 
      both PocMSP-1 and PowMSP-1, albeit at a non-significant level. However, when
      MSP-1 of both these species was considered together, piS was significantly
      greater than piN (p<0.0001), suggesting that purifying selection has shaped
      diversity at this locus prior to speciation. Phylogenetic analysis based on
      conserved domains has placed PocMSP-1 and PowMSP-1 in a distinct bifurcating
      branch that probably diverged from each other around 4.5 million years ago.
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The MSP-1 sequences support that P. ovale curtisi and P.
      ovale wallikeri are distinct species. Both species are sympatric in Thailand. The
      low level of sequence diversity in PocMSP-1 and PowMSP-1 among Thai isolates
      could stem from persistent low prevalence of these species, limiting the chance
      of outcrossing at this locus.

TI  - Anti-malarial IgG subclasses pattern and FcgammaRIIa (CD32) polymorphism among
      pregnancy-associated malaria in semi-immune Saudi women.
PG  - 110
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women remain are at an increased risk of malaria with
      primigravidae being at the highest risk. Genetic polymorphism of the Fc receptor 
      IIa for immunologlobulin (Ig) G (FcgammaRIIa) determines IgG subclass binding.
      Protection against pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is associated with the
      production of IgG specific for apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1). The present
      study was undertaken to examine the relationship between specific IgG/IgG
      subclasses and malaria infection. The second aim of the study is to examine the
      association between FcgammaRIIa R/H131 polymorphism in correlation with specific 
      anti-malarial IgG antibodies of AMA-1 distribution and asymptomatic malaria
      infection among Saudi women living in the southern part of Saudi Arabia. METHODS:
      One hundred and twenty pregnant women living in an area of meso-endemic
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection were consecutively enrolled onto the
      study. These pregnant women were asymptomatic and attending routine antenatal
      clinics. The levels of plasma antibodies (IgG and subclasses AMA-1) were measured
      using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Genotyping of
      FcgammaRIIa-R/H131 dimorphism was performed using gene-specific polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) amplification with allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion
      (BstU1) of the PCR product. RESULTS: A total of sixty-two (52%) pregnant women
      was diagnosed with asymptomatic malarial infection (ASM) compared with 58 (48%)
      malaria free controls (MFC). In the ASM group, there were high levels of
      anti-malarial IgG1 and IgG3, when compared to MFC (P value <0.001, respectively).
      The FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype and R131 were found to be statistically
      significantly more prevalent in the ASM group when compared to the MFC group [55%
      for ASM versus 12% for MFC, odds ratio (OR) 5.62, 95% confidence interval (CI)=
      (2.03- 15.58), P value= 0.001]. However, the H/H131 genotype showed statistically
      significant association with MFC [14% for ASM versus 50% for MFC, OR(0.36), 95%
      CI= (0.14- 0.95), P value= 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the ASM
      patients had higher anti-malarial IgG and IgG subclasses antibody levels when
      compared to the MFC. The FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype and R131 allele were found
      to be statistically prevalent in the ASM when compared to the MFC group. The
      individuals carrying H/H131 were consistently associated with higher levels of
      anti-malarial IgG subclasses.

      malaria -assessment of DNA extraction methods and field applicability.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The need for new malaria surveillance tools and strategies is
      critical, given improved global malaria control and regional elimination efforts.
      High quality Plasmodium falciparum DNA can reliably be extracted from malaria
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Together with highly sensitive molecular assays,
      wide scale collection of used RDTs may serve as a modern tool for improved
      malaria case detection and drug resistance surveillance. However, comparative
      studies of DNA extraction efficiency from RDTs and the field applicability are
      lacking. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate different methods of
      DNA extraction from RDTs and to test the field applicability for the purpose of
      molecular epidemiological investigations. METHODS: DNA was extracted from two RDT
      devices (Paracheck-Pf(R) and SD Bioline Malaria Pf/Pan(R)), seeded in vitro with 
      10-fold dilutions of cultured 3D7 P. falciparum parasites diluted in malaria
      negative whole blood. The level of P. falciparum detection was determined for
      each extraction method and RDT device with multiple nested-PCR and real-time PCR 
      assays. The field applicability was tested on 855 paired RDT (Paracheck-Pf) and
      filter paper (Whatman(R) 3MM) blood samples (734 RDT negative and 121 RDT
      positive samples) collected from febrile patients in Zanzibar 2010. RDT positive 
      samples were genotyped at four key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
      pfmdr1 and pfcrt as well as for pfmdr1 copy number, all associated with
      anti-malarial drug resistance. RESULTS: The P. falciparum DNA detection limit
      varied with RDT device and extraction method. Chelex-100 extraction performed
      best for all extraction matrixes. There was no statistically significant
      difference in PCR detection rates in DNA extracted from RDTs and filter paper
      field samples. Similarly there were no significant differences in the PCR success
      rates and genotyping outcomes for the respective SNPs in the 121 RDT positive
      samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results support RDTs as a valuable source of parasite
      DNA and provide evidence for RDT-DNA extraction for improved malaria case
      detection, molecular drug resistance surveillance, and RDT quality control.

AB  - This study deals with the underlying causes of failure of chloroquine in the
      treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in some malaria-endemic regions of
      India. Samples were collected from 141 patients in Purulia from March of 2007 to 
      April of 2008. In vitro drug susceptibility tests, parasitic DNA isolation
      followed by polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment-length
      polymorphisms of different codons of the pfcrt gene (76) and pfmdr-I genes (86,
      1042, and 1246) were assessed. The responses of 141 patients to chloroquine were 
      determined. Prevalence of double pfmdr-I (58.16%) mutation (86Y+1246Y) and some
      (14.89%) single pfcrt mutations with triple pfmdr-I mutation
      (76T+86Y+1042D+1246Y) were found. Interestingly, double pfmdr-I mutation (86Y and
      1246Y codons) was observed with the early treatment failure cases. These results 
      show, for the first time in India that in vitro chloroquine resistance and in
      vivo chloroquine treatment failure were caused by double pfmdr-I (P < 0.001)
      mutation.

      in Afghanistan.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) is now first-line 
      treatment for Plasmodium falciparum infection in several south Asian countries,
      including Afghanistan. Molecular studies provide a sensitive means to investigate
      the current state of drug susceptibility to the SP component, and can also
      provide information on the likely efficacy of other potential forms of
      artemisinin-combination therapy. METHODS: During the years 2007 to 2010, 120
      blood spots from patients with P. falciparum malaria were obtained in four
      provinces of Afghanistan. PCR-based methods were used to detect drug-resistance
      mutations in dhfr, dhps, pfcrt and pfmdr1, as well as to determine copy number of
      pfmdr1. RESULTS: The majority (95.5%) of infections had a double mutation in the 
      dhfr gene (C59R, S108N); no mutations at dhfr positions 16, 51 or 164 were seen. 
      Most isolates were wild type across the dhps gene, but five isolates from the
      provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan had the triple mutation
      A437G / K540E / A581G; all five cases were successfully treated with three
      receiving AS+SP and two receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. All isolates
      showed the pfcrt SVNMT chloroquine resistance haplotype. Five of 79 isolates had 
      the pfmdr1 N86Y mutation, while 52 had pfmdr1 Y184F; positions 1034, 1042 and
      1246 were wild type in all isolates. The pfmdr1 gene was not amplified in any
      sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that shortly after the adoption of
      AS+SP as first-line treatment in Afghanistan, most parasites had a double
      mutation haplotype in dhfr, and a small number of isolates from eastern
      Afghanistan harboured a triple mutation haplotype in dhps. The impact of these
      mutations on the efficacy of AS+SP remains to be assessed in significant numbers 
      of patients, but these results are clearly concerning since they suggest a higher
      degree of SP resistance than previously detected. Further focused molecular and
      clinical studies in this region are urgently required.

TI  - An intensive longitudinal cohort study of Malian children and adults reveals no
      evidence of acquired immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection.
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1093/cid/cit174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In experimental models of human and mouse malaria, sterilizing liver 
      stage immunity that blocks progression of Plasmodium infection to the symptomatic
      blood stage can be readily demonstrated. However, it remains unclear whether
      individuals in malaria-endemic areas acquire such immunity. METHODS: In Mali, 251
      healthy children and adults aged 4-25 years who were free of blood-stage
      Plasmodium infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were enrolled in a
      longitudinal study just prior to an intense 6-month malaria season. Subsequent
      clinical malaria episodes were detected by weekly active surveillance and
      self-referral. Asymptomatic P. falciparum infections were detected by blood-smear
      microscopy and PCR analysis of dried blood spots that had been collected every 2 
      weeks for 7 months. RESULTS: As expected, the risk of clinical malaria decreased 
      with increasing age (log-rank test, P = .0038). However, analysis of PCR data
      showed no age-related differences in P. falciparum infection risk (log-rank test,
      P = .37). CONCLUSIONS: Despite years of exposure to intense P. falciparum
      transmission, there is no evidence of acquired, sterile immunity to P. falciparum
      infection in this population, even as clinical immunity to blood-stage malaria is
      clearly acquired. Understanding why repeated P. falciparum infections do not
      induce sterile protection may lead to insights for developing vaccines that
      target the liver stage in malaria-endemic populations.

AB  - The role of submicroscopic infections in modulating malaria antibody responses is
      poorly understood and requires longitudinal studies. A cohort of 249 children
      </=5 years of age, 126 children between 6 and 10 years and 134 adults >/=20 years
      was recruited in an area of intense malaria transmission in Apac, Uganda and
      treated with artemether/lumefantrine at enrolment. Parasite carriage was
      determined at enrolment and after 6 and 16 weeks using microscopy and PCR.
      Antibody prevalence and titres to circumsporozoite protein, apical membrane
      antigen-1 (AMA-1), merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-119 ), merozoite surface
      protein-2 (MSP-2) and Anopheles gambiae salivary gland protein 6 (gSG6) were
      determined by ELISA. Plasmodium falciparum infections were detected in 38.1%
      (194/509) of the individuals by microscopy and in 57.1% (284/493) of the
      individuals by PCR at enrolment. Antibody prevalence and titre against AMA-1,
      MSP-119 , MSP-2 and gSG6 were related to concurrent (sub-)microscopic
      parasitaemia. Responses were stable in children who were continuously infected
      with malaria parasites but declined in children who were never parasitaemic
      during the study or were not re-infected after treatment. These findings indicate
      that continued malaria infections are required to maintain antibody titres in an 
      area of intense malaria transmission.

TI  - Malaria burden and artemisinin resistance in the mobile and migrant population on
      the Thai-Myanmar border, 1999-2011: an observational study.
PG  - e1001398
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit has been working on the Thai-Myanmar
      border for 25 y providing early diagnosis and treatment (EDT) of malaria.
      Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum has declined, but resistance to artesunate 
      has emerged. We expanded malaria activities through EDT and evaluated the impact 
      over a 12-y period. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 1 October 1999 and 30 September
      2011, the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit increased the number of cross-border
      (Myanmar side) health facilities from two to 11 and recorded the number of
      malaria consultations. Changes in malaria incidence were estimated from a cohort 
      of pregnant women, and prevalence from cross-sectional surveys. In vivo and in
      vitro antimalarial drug efficacy were monitored. Over this period, the number of 
      malaria cases detected increased initially, but then declined rapidly. In
      children under 5 y, the percentage of consultations due to malaria declined from 
      78% (95% CI 76-80) (1,048/1,344 consultations) to 7% (95% CI 6.2-7.1) (767/11,542
      consultations), p<0.001. The ratio of P. falciparum/P. vivax declined from 1.4
      (95% CI 1.3-1.4) to 0.7 (95% CI 0.7-0.8). The case fatality rate was low
      (39/75,126; 0.05% [95% CI 0.04-0.07]). The incidence of malaria declined from 1.1
      to 0.1 episodes per pregnant women-year. The cumulative proportion of P.
      falciparum decreased significantly from 24.3% (95% CI 21.0-28.0) (143/588
      pregnant women) to 3.4% (95% CI 2.8-4.3) (76/2,207 pregnant women), p<0.001. The 
      in vivo efficacy of mefloquine-artesunate declined steadily, with a sharp drop in
      2011 (day-42 PCR-adjusted cure rate 42% [95% CI 20-62]). The proportion of
      patients still slide positive for malaria at day 3 rose from 0% in 2000 to reach 
      28% (95% CI 13-45) (8/29 patients) in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the emergence of
      resistance to artesunate in P. falciparum, the strategy of EDT with
      artemisinin-based combination treatments has been associated with a reduction in 
      malaria in the migrant population living on the Thai-Myanmar border. Although
      limited by its observational nature, this study provides useful data on malaria
      burden in a strategically crucial geographical area. Alternative fixed
      combination treatments are needed urgently to replace the failing first-line
      regimen of mefloquine and artesunate. Please see later in the article for the
      Editors' Summary.

TI  - Dynamic epigenetic regulation of gene expression during the life cycle of malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - e1003170
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003170 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as one of the major factors of the dynamics of
      gene expression in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. To
      elucidate the role of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation
      associated with the progression of the P. falciparum intraerythrocytic
      development cycle (IDC), we mapped the temporal pattern of chromosomal
      association with histone H3 and H4 modifications using ChIP-on-chip. Here, we
      have generated a broad integrative epigenomic map of twelve histone modifications
      during the P. falciparum IDC including H4K5ac, H4K8ac, H4K12ac, H4K16ac, H3K9ac, 
      H3K14ac, H3K56ac, H4K20me1, H4K20me3, H3K4me3, H3K79me3 and H4R3me2. While some
      modifications were found to be associated with the vast majority of the genome
      and their occupancy was constant, others showed more specific and highly dynamic 
      distribution. Importantly, eight modifications displaying tight correlations with
      transcript levels showed differential affinity to distinct genomic regions with
      H4K8ac occupying predominantly promoter regions while others occurred at the 5'
      ends of coding sequences. The promoter occupancy of H4K8ac remained unchanged
      when ectopically inserted at a different locus, indicating the presence of
      specific DNA elements that recruit histone modifying enzymes regardless of their 
      broad chromatin environment. In addition, we showed the presence of multivalent
      domains on the genome carrying more than one histone mark, highlighting the
      importance of combinatorial effects on transcription. Overall, our work portrays 
      a substantial association between chromosomal locations of various epigenetic
      markers, transcriptional activity and global stage-specific transitions in the
      epigenome.

TI  - Malaria transmission after artemether-lumefantrine and
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine: a randomized trial.
PG  - 1637-45
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit077 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) reduces the potential for
      malaria transmission, compared with non-ACTs. It is unclear whether this effect
      differs between ACTs. METHODS: A total of 298 children (age, 6 months to 10
      years) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL; n = 153) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP; n = 
      145) in Mbita, a community in western Kenya. Gametocyte carriage was determined
      by molecular methods on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 after treatment
      initiation. The gametocyte infectiousness to mosquitoes was determined by
      mosquito-feeding assays on day 7 after beginning therapy. RESULTS: The cumulative
      risk of recurrent parasitemia on day 42 after initiation of treatment, unadjusted
      by polymerase chain reaction findings, was 20.7% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      14.4-28.2) for AL, compared with 3.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.5) for DP (P < .001). The
      mean duration of gametocyte carriage was 5.5 days (95% CI, 3.6-8.5) for AL and
      15.3 days (95% CI, 9.7-24.2) for DP (P = .001). The proportion of mosquitoes that
      became infected after feeding on blood from AL-treated children was 1.88% (43 of 
      2293), compared with 3.50% (83 of 2371) for those that fed on blood from
      DP-treated children (P = .06); the oocyst burden among mosquitoes was lower among
      those that fed on blood from AL-treated children (P = .005) CONCLUSIONS: While DP
      was associated with a longer prophylactic time after treatment, gametocyte
      carriage and malaria transmission to mosquitoes was lower after AL treatment.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted malaria in Ghana.
PG  - 1735-41
LID - 10.1093/cid/cit130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of malaria parasitemia in blood
      donors varies from 0.6% to 50%. Although the burden of TTM in malaria-endemic
      countries is unknown, it is recommended that all donated blood is screened for
      malaria parasites. This study aimed to establish the incidence of TTM and
      identify a suitable screening test. METHODS: Pregnant women, children, and
      immunocompromised malaria-negative transfusion recipients in a teaching hospital 
      in Ghana were recruited over the course of 1 year. Parasites detected in
      recipients within 14 days of the transfusion were genotyped and compared to
      parasites in the transfused blood. The presence of genotypically identical
      parasites in the recipient and the transfused blood confirmed
      transfusion-transmitted malaria. Four malaria screening tests were compared to
      assess their usefulness in the context of African blood banks. RESULTS: Of the 50
      patients who received transfusions that were positive for Plasmodium falciparum
      by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 7 recipients developed PCR-detectable
      parasitemia. In only 1 of the 50 recipients (2%) was the parasite identical to
      that in the transfused blood. The prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in
      transfused blood was 4.7% (21/445) by microscopy, 13.7% (60/440) by rapid
      diagnostic test, 18% (78/436) by PCR, and 22.2% (98/442) by enzyme immunoassay.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although malaria parasites are commonly detected in blood donors in 
      malaria-endemic areas, transfusion-transmitted malaria occurs infrequently.
      Policies recommend screening blood donors for malaria, but none of the commonly
      used methods is sufficiently sensitive to be used by blood banks in
      malaria-endemic countries.

TI  - Analysis of Fcgamma receptor IIa (cd32) gene polymorphism and anti-malarial IgG
      subclass antibodies to asexual blood-stage antigen of Plasmodium falciparum in an
      unstable malaria endemic area of Iran.

AB  - One of the main host genetic factors involved in inflammation, immune responses
      and pathogenesis of malaria is FcgammaRIIa (cd32) gene. A single point mutation
      at position 131 replace an arginine (R) with a histidine (H) that can affect the 
      affinity of the receptor for human IgG subclasses. This investigation was
      designed to explore the polymorphisms at FcgammaRIIa gene in association with
      both anti-malarial total IgG antibody and IgG subclass profiles to C-terminal
      region of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP-1(19)). In
      this study, 166 infected patients with P. falciparum who are living in a malaria 
      endemic area of Iran were studied using PCR-RFLP and ELISA methods. The results
      showed that the frequency of FcgammaRIIa-R/R131, -R/H131 and -H/H131 genotypes
      was 9.6%, 42.8% and 47.6%, respectively. Level of total IgG to recombinant
      PfMSP-1(19) antigen showed that there was no difference among the
      FcgammaRIIa-R/R131, -R/H131 and -H/H131 groups. With regards to the IgG
      subclasses, the anti-malarial IgG1 antibodies predominated. Also, there was a
      significant difference between the frequency of positive responders for
      anti-PfMSP-1(19) IgG and IgG1 antibodies in P. falciparum-infected individuals
      with FcgammaRIIa-R/R131, -R/H131 or -H/H131 genotypes (P<0.05, X(2) test).
      Regarding to IgG2-PfMSP-1(19) antibody, 27.27% (FcgammaRIIa-R/R131), 25.71%
      (FcgammaRIIa-R/H131) and 22.2% (FcgammaRIIa-H/H131) of IgG responders showed
      positive antibody response. Taken together, this study is the first report that
      exhibits the high frequency of both FcgammaRIIa-H131H genotypes and H131 allele
      in the Baluchi ethnic group, which was similar to the Fulani ethnic group. The
      present results provide additional data to understand the role of FcgammaRIIa-131
      genotypes in the pathogenesis of malaria.

TI  - Diversity of the var gene family of Indonesian Plasmodium falciparum isolates.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The large polymorphic protein PfEMP1 is encoded by the var gene
      family. PfEMP1 has been shown to play an important role as cytoadherence ligand
      on the surface of infected erythrocytes and thereby contributes to the distinct
      pathogenesis of malaria. The study explored the diversity of the DBL1alpha and
      DBL2beta-C2 domains of the protein from Indonesian Plasmodium falciparum field
      isolates. METHODS: Samples of patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria from
      two different malaria-endemic areas in Indonesia were collected and DNA directly 
      extracted. Dried blood on filter paper was prepared for RNA extraction. PCR
      amplicons were either cloned and subsequently sequenced or directly sequenced for
      analysis on nucleotide and amino acid level. Recently published as well as
      self-designed primers were used for amplification. RESULTS: Blood from eight
      patients was finally used for analysis. Seventy-one different sequences out of
      over 500 DBL1alpha sequenced clones were observed, resulting in an average of 8.9
      different DBL1alpha sequences per isolate. The average DBL1alpha sequence
      similarity within isolates was similar to between isolates. Phylogenetic analysis
      demonstrated no clustering of sequences regarding strain or geographical origin. 
      The DBL1alpha sequences were analysed by distribution of semi-conserved features 
      (cysteine/PoLV1-4 grouping) and classified into six sequence groups. The
      DBL1alpha cys2 type was observed in all expressed sequences in vivo. Expression
      of certain DBL sequences implied potential involvement in the pathogenesis. As
      expected, the DBL2beta-C2 domains showed high to moderate homology among each
      other. CONCLUSION: The DBL1alpha domains of PfEMP1 from clinical Indonesian
      isolates showed high divergence among same isolates and some similarities with
      other Asia-Pacific strains. Further investigations of important var gene domains 
      with a larger sample size are required to confirm with statistical significance
      observed associations with severe malaria in Indonesian samples.

      massive splenomegaly, raised IgM and antimalarial antibodies and a response to
      antimalarial therapy. Although malaria is endemic to Pakistan, HMS is uncommon.
      We report on HMS in a patient with massive splenomegaly, positive Plasmodium

PG  - e57294
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0057294 [doi]
AB  - During the last four years, knowledge about the diversity of Plasmodium species
      in African great apes has considerably increased. Several new species were
      described in chimpanzees and gorillas, and some species that were previously
      considered as strictly of human interest were found to be infecting African apes.
      The description in gorillas of P. praefalciparum, the closest relative of P.
      falciparum which is the main malignant agent of human malaria, definitively
      changed the way we understand the evolution and origin of P. falciparum. This
      parasite is now considered to have appeared recently, following a cross-species
      transfer from gorillas to humans. However, the Plasmodium vector mosquito species
      that have served as bridge between these two host species remain unknown. In
      order to identify the vectors that ensure ape Plasmodium transmission and
      evaluate the risk of transfer of these parasites to humans, we carried out a
      field study in Gabon to capture Anopheles in areas where wild and semi-wild ape
      populations live. We collected 1070 Anopheles females belonging to 15 species,
      among which An. carnevalei, An. moucheti and An. marshallii were the most common 
      species. Using mtDNA-based PCR tools, we discovered that An. moucheti, a major
      human malaria vector in Central Africa, could also ensure the natural
      transmission of P. praefalciparum among great apes. We also showed that, together
      with An. vinckei, An. moucheti was infected with P. vivax-like parasites. An.
      moucheti constitutes, therefore, a major candidate for the transfer of Plasmodium
      parasites from apes to humans.

      sensitive, cost effective and capable of performing large scale diagnosis. The
      real-time PCR methods are particularly robust for large scale screening and they 
      can be used in malaria control and elimination programs. We have designed novel
      self-quenching photo-induced electron transfer (PET) fluorogenic primers for the 
      detection of P. falciparum and the Plasmodium genus by real-time PCR. A total of 
      119 samples consisting of different malaria species and mixed infections were
      used to test the utility of the novel PET-PCR primers in the diagnosis of
      clinical samples. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a nested 
      PCR as the gold standard and the novel primer sets demonstrated 100% sensitivity 
      and specificity. The limits of detection for P. falciparum was shown to be 3.2
      parasites/microl using both Plasmodium genus and P. falciparum-specific primers
      and 5.8 parasites/microl for P. ovale, 3.5 parasites/microl for P. malariae and 5
      parasites/microl for P. vivax using the genus specific primer set. Moreover, the 
      reaction can be duplexed to detect both Plasmodium spp. and P. falciparum in a
      single reaction. The PET-PCR assay does not require internal probes or
      intercalating dyes which makes it convenient to use and less expensive than other
      real-time PCR diagnostic formats. Further validation of this technique in the
      field will help to assess its utility for large scale screening in malaria
      control and elimination programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A rapid, non-invasive, and inexpensive point-of-care (POC) diagnostic
      for malaria followed by therapeutic intervention would improve the ability to
      control infection in endemic areas. METHODS: A semi-nested PCR amplification
      protocol is described for quantitative detection of Plasmodium falciparum and is 
      compared to a traditional nested PCR. The approach uses primers that target the
      P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase gene. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that
      it is possible to perform an uninterrupted, asymmetric, semi-nested PCR assay
      with reduced assay time to detect P. falciparum without compromising the
      sensitivity and specificity of the assay using saliva as a testing matrix.
      CONCLUSIONS: The development of this PCR allows nucleic acid amplification
      without the need to transfer amplicon from the first PCR step to a second
      reaction tube with nested primers, thus reducing both the chance of contamination
      and the time for analysis to < two hours. Analysis of the PCR amplicon yield was 
      adapted to lateral flow detection using the quantitative up-converting phosphor
      (UCP) reporter technology. This approach provides a basis for migration of the
      assay to a POC microfluidic format. In addition the assay was successfully
      evaluated with oral samples. Oral fluid collection provides a simple non-invasive
      method to collect clinical samples.

TI  - Performance of two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria diagnosis at the
      China-Myanmar border area.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become an essential tool in the
      contemporary malaria control and management programmes in the world. This study
      aims to evaluate the performance of two commonly used RDTs for malaria diagnosis 
      in the China-Myanmar border area. METHODS: A total 606 febrile patients in the
      China-Myanmar border were recruited to this study and were diagnosed for malaria 
      infections by microscopy, two RDTs tests (Pf/Pan device, and Pv/Pf device) and
      nested PCR. RESULTS: Malaria parasites were found in 143 patients by microscopy, 
      of which 51, 73, and 19 were Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and P.
      falciparum/P. vivax mixed infections, respectively. Compared to microscopy, the
      sensitivity of the Pf/Pan device was 88.6% for P. falciparum and 69.9% for P.
      vivax with the specificity of 90.4%. For a subset of 350 patients, the
      sensitivity of the Pf/Pan device and Pv/Pf device for detection of P. falciparum 
      was 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively; and for detection of P. vivax was 72.0% and
      73.8%, respectively. The specificity of the Pf/Pan device and Pv/Pf device was
      94.3% and 96.5%, respectively. Nested PCR detected malaria parasites in 174 of
      606 samples, of which 67, 79, two and 26 were P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale
      and P. falciparum/P. vivax mixed infections, respectively. Compared to nested
      PCR, all other methods had sensitivity below 80%, suggesting that a significant
      number of cases were missed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to PCR, both microscopy and
      RDTs had lower sensitivities. RDTs had similar performance to microscopy for P.
      falciparum diagnosis, but performed worse for P. vivax diagnosis. Other RDT
      products should be selected with higher sensitivity (and good specificity) for
      both P. falciparum and P. vivax diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyronaridine-artesunate (PA) is indicated for the treatment of acute 
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria. METHODS:
      Individual patient data on safety outcomes were integrated from six randomized
      clinical trials conducted in Africa and Asia in patients with microscopically
      confirmed P. falciparum (five studies) or P. vivax (one study) malaria. Efficacy 
      against P. falciparum was evaluated across three Phase III clinical trials.
      RESULTS: The safety population included 2,815 patients randomized to PA, 1,254 to
      comparators: mefloquine + artesunate (MQ + AS), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or 
      chloroquine. All treatments were generally well tolerated. Adverse events
      occurred in 57.2% (1,611/2,815) of patients with PA versus 51.5% (646/1,254) for 
      comparators, most commonly (PA; comparators): headache (10.6%; 9.9%), cough
      (5.9%; 5.6%) and anaemia (4.5%; 2.9%). Serious averse events were uncommon for
      all treatments (0-0.7%). Transient increases in alanine aminotransferase and
      aspartate aminotransferase were observed with PA but did not lead to any clinical
      sequelae. For P. falciparum malaria, day-28 PCR-corrected adequate clinical and
      parasitological response with PA was 93.6% ([1,921/2,052] 95% CI 92.6, 94.7) in
      the intent-to-treat population and 98.5% ([1,852/1,880] 95% CI 98.0, 99.1) in the
      per-protocol population. Median parasite clearance time was 24.1 h with PA, 31.9 
      h with MQ + AS, and 24.0 h with AL. Median fever clearance time was 15.5 h with
      PA, 15.8 h with MQ + AS, and 14.0 h with AL. By day 42, P. falciparum gametocytes
      had declined to near zero for all treatments. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pyronaridine-artesunate was well tolerated with no safety concerns with the
      exception of mostly mild transient rises in transaminases. Efficacy was high and 
      met the requirements for use as first-line therapy. Pyronaridine-artesunate
      should be considered for inclusion in malaria treatment programmes. TRIAL

AB  - The aim of this work was to define the cause of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP)
      treatment failure in Plasmodium falciparum infections in a malaria-endemic zone
      of India. Samples were collected from 176 patients in Kolkata from November 2008 
      to July 2009. In vitro susceptibility testing was performed on all isolates.
      Parasite DNA was extracted, and PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (RFLP) analysis of different codons of the dhfr gene (16, 51, 59, 108 and 164)
      and dhps gene (436, 437, 540, 581 and 613) were performed. Finally, sequencing of
      the products was performed to confirm the mutations. The in vivo treatment
      response to SP among the 176 patients was determined. A novel mutation of
      isoleucine was observed at codon 108 of the dhfr gene, which was highly
      correlated with in vitro SP resistance as well as early treatment failure. A
      double dhfr mutation (108I+51I) was observed in 77.3% of isolates, and triple
      mutation of the dhps gene was observed in 18.2% of isolates. In this endemic
      zone, SP treatment failure is due to a novel dhfr mutation (108I+51I) and any one
      of the dhps mutations (S436A, A437G, A581G or A613T/S). An increase in these
      mutations was highly correlated with SP resistance (P < 0.0001).

TI  - High prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in a tribal population in eastern India.
PG  - 1439-44
LID - 10.1128/JCM.03437-12 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium falciparum is an important obstacle to
      eliminating malaria. Asymptomatic carriers do not seek treatment for infection,
      and therefore they become a reservoir for the parasite. For this reason, these
      carriers pose a real public health risk. The systematic identification and
      treatment of asymptomatic infections should reduce the parasite reservoir. A
      large reduction in this pool will lower the chance of transmission of the
      disease. In this study, we screened a tribal population of 1,040 individuals in
      the Purulia district of West Bengal by using a dual-antigen rapid diagnostic kit 
      (RDK), microscopy, and species-specific PCR. All positive individuals were
      treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) (artesunate plus
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) and followed for 42 days. Polymorphisms in candidate
      genes were screened by DNA sequencing. A significant proportion (8.4%) of the
      study population was infected with P. falciparum but showed no clinical
      manifestations. The PCR method was more sensitive in detecting infection than the
      RDK or microscopy. The efficacy of the ACT was 97%. In the pfcrt gene, the
      mutation K76T (the mutated amino acid is indicated by bold type) was found in
      100% of the cases. In the pfmdr1 gene, the mutations N86Y and Y184F were noted in
      55.5% and 11% of the cases, respectively. Six different haplotypes were
      identified in the pfdhfr-pfdhps genes. Most importantly, the quintuple mutant
      A(16)I(51)R(59)N(108)I(164)-S(436)G(437)E(540)A(581)A(613) was found in 10% of
      the isolates, which is potentially important for the development of
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. A significant proportion of the study
      population harboring P. falciparum does not seek treatment and therefore serves
      as a reservoir for the parasite, maintaining the natural cycle. If the National
      Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) of India is to eliminate malaria,
      then this hidden parasite burden needs to be addressed properly. Similar study in
      other parts of the country could help to determine the magnitude of the problem.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: WHO Treatment Guidelines recommend that artemisinin-based
      combination therapies (ACTs) are used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria. Artemether plus lumefantrine (AL) is currently approved in 86
      countries, with 30 of the 47 sub-Saharan African countries using it as first-line
      therapy, and 8 as second-line therapy. The dispersible formulation of AL that
      facilitates administration to infants and children, being simpler for caregivers 
      to prepare and administer than crushed tablets, and easier for sick children and 
      infants to take is discussed. AREAS COVERED: A descriptive summary of available
      literature from sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates consistently high efficacy and
      safety for over a decade, with the majority of reported 28-day PCR-corrected cure
      rates being above 95%. EXPERT OPINION: AL is an important antimalarial that will 
      play a major role as countries move towards the elimination of malaria. Further
      advances in best practice of ACT use will come through strategies to prolong the 
      longevity of ACTs, improved access to ACTs, new data on the use of ACTs in
      pregnancy, asymptomatic patients and novel paediatric formulations.

      PF3D7_1363700.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-66 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efforts to control malaria are demanding due to drug-resistant
      parasites, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and poor health infrastructure in
      malaria-endemic countries. Therefore, the research and development of additional 
      malaria control methods are crucial. For host-parasite interactions, surface
      antigens and secreted proteins are likely to be involved in infectivity and
      invasion of host tissues and therefore can be effective targets for control by
      vaccines, drug therapy, or novel mosquito control methods. In an effort to
      identify and characterize genes that may have a role in host-parasite
      interaction, this study describes the expression profile of Plasmodium falciparum
      PF3D7_1363700. METHODS: A P. falciparum gene, PF3D7_1363700, was identified by a 
      search of the annotated Plasmodium genome database. Protein alignments of
      PF3D7_1363700 orthologues from various Plasmodium species were performed to
      demonstrate protein similarity. Transcript expression profiles of PF3D7_1363700
      were determined via reverse-transcriptase PCR and protein expression was
      investigated by immunofluorescence assays, western blot analysis and green
      fluorescent trafficking studies. RESULTS: The PF3D7_1363700 protein demonstrates 
      significant similarity with orthologues in other Plasmodium species and appears
      to be unique to Apicomplexans. The PF3D7_1363700 transcription profile
      demonstrated expression during the intra-erythrocytic, oocyst sporozoite, and
      salivary gland sporozoite stages while the PF3D7_1363700 protein was only
      detected during the intra-erythrocytic stages. CONCLUSIONS: This research
      utilized an in silico approach to identify a well-conserved protein known as
      PF3D7_1363700. By molecular, biochemical and cellular analyses, PF3D7_1363700 was
      discovered to be an intra-erythrocytic-specific stage protein that is unique to
      Apicomplexans.

TI  - The bionomics of Anopheles merus (Diptera: Culicidae) along the Kenyan coast.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-6-37 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles merus, a sibling species of the Anopheles gambiae complex
      occurs along the East African coast but its biology and role in malaria
      transmission in this region is poorly understood. We evaluated the blood feeding 
      pattern and the role of this species in malaria transmission in Malindi district,
      Coastal Kenya. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were collected indoors by CDC light
      traps and Pyrethrum Spray Catch and outdoors by CDC light traps. Anopheles
      females were identified to species by morphological characteristics and sibling
      species of An. gambiae complex distinguished by rDNA polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR). Screening for host blood meal sources and presence or absence of
      Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite proteins was achieved by Enzyme Linked
      Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). RESULTS: Anopheles merus comprised 77.8% of the 387
      Anopheles gambiae s.l adults that were collected. Other sibling species of
      Anopheles gambiae s.l identified in the study site included An. arabiensis(3.6%),
      and An. gambiae s.s. (8%). The human blood index for An. merus was 0.12, while
      the sporozoite rate was 0.3%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that An. merus
      can play a minor role in malaria transmission along the Kenyan Coast and should
      be a target for vector control which in turn could be applied in designing and
      implementing mosquito control programmes targeting marsh-breeding mosquitoes;
      with the ultimate goal being to reduce the transmission of malaria associated
      with these vectors.

TI  - Asymptomatic plasmodial infection is associated with increased tumor necrosis
      factor receptor II-expressing regulatory T cells and suppressed type 2 immune
      responses.
PG  - 1590-9
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria-endemic areas, a proportion of individuals becomes chronic
      carriers of parasites with few or no clinical signs. There is little information 
      on cellular immune responses in asymptomatic parasite carriers. METHODS: In 80
      schoolchildren residing in a malaria-endemic area of Flores Island, Indonesia,
      T-helper subsets, regulatory T-cell (Treg) frequencies, tumor necrosis factor
      receptor type II (TNFRII) expression on Tregs, and cytokine responses induced by 
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) were measured, and values
      for asymptomatic infected subjects were compared to those for uninfected
      controls. To ascertain that alterations found were due to the presence of malaria
      parasites, the immune responses were analyzed in 16 children before and 1 month
      after antimalarial treatment. RESULTS: TNFRII expression, a marker of activation 
      on Tregs, was higher during infection but decreased upon treatment.
      GATA3-positive cells and the level of interleukin 13 secretion in response to P. 
      falciparum-infected RBCs appeared to be suppressed by plasmodial infection, as
      both increased after antimalarial treatment. TNFRII expression on Tregs
      correlated positively with TNF in response to P. falciparum-infected RBCs, but
      this association disappeared following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria parasites 
      associated with asymptomatic infections seem to result in increased TNFRII
      expression on Tregs, as well as suppressed Th2 cytokine responses, features that 
      might be important for survival of the parasites in asymptomatic carriers.

PG  - 1691-700
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3325-3 [doi]
AB  - Diversity in parasite virulence is one of the factors that contribute to the
      clinical outcome of malaria infections. The association between the severity of
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria and the number of distinct parasite populations
      infecting the host (multiplicity of infection) or polymorphism within any of the 
      specific antigen genes was investigated. The study included 164 children
      presenting with mild and severe malaria from central Uganda where malaria is
      meso-endemic. The polymorphic regions of the circumsporozoite protein (csp),
      merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp1 and msp2), and glutamate-rich protein
      (glurp) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction methods and fragment analysis
      by gel electrophoresis. In a subset of samples fragment analysis was also
      performed by fluorescent PCR genotyping followed by capillary electrophoresis.
      The multiplicity of infection (MOI), determined as the highest number of alleles 
      detected within any of the four genetic loci, was significantly higher in severe 
      than in mild malaria cases (mean 3.7 and 3.0, respectively, P=0.002). No
      particular genotype or allelic family of msp1 or msp2 was associated with
      severity of malaria, and nor did the genotyping method reveal any significant
      difference in MOI when only assessed by msp2 genotyping. Severity of malaria was 
      not linked to the predominance of any particular msp1 or msp2 allelic types,
      independent of methods used for genotyping. Monitoring the dynamics of multiple
      clone infections in relation to disease outcome, host immune status and genetic
      factors will provide more insight into parasite virulence mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congo-Brazzaville adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      in 2006. Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine are the
      first-line and second-line anti-malarial drugs to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium 
      falciparum malaria, respectively. The baseline efficacy of AS + AQ was evaluated 
      from February to August 2005 in patients living in Brazzaville, the capital city 
      of the Republic of Congo. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven patients (96 </= 
      5 years old and 101 >5 years old, including adults) were recruited in a
      non-randomized study, treated under supervision with AS + AQ, and were followed
      up for 28 days in accordance with the 2003 World Health Organization protocol.
      Plasmodium falciparum recrudescent isolates from day 7 to day 28 were compared to
      pretreatment isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to distinguish between
      re-infection and recrudescence. RESULTS: The overall efficacy of AS + AQ after
      PCR correction on day 28 was 94.4%. An adequate clinical and parasitological
      response was observed in 94.3% and 94.4% of children aged </= 5 years old and
      those aged >5 years old (including adults), respectively. The main reported
      adverse events were dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, pruritus, headache, anorexia,
      and abdominal pain. CONCLUSION: This study has shown the high efficacy of AS + AQ
      in Congolese patients of all ages with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria and
      serves as the baseline efficacy and tolerance of this ACT in Brazzaville.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from south western
      Nigeria.
PG  - 355-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an
      important public health vector. With the use of PCR, its genetic diversity has
      been extensively studied with dearth information from Nigeria. METHODS: In this
      study, 100 P. falciparum strains merozoite surface protein 1(msp-1), merozoite
      surface protein 2 (msp-2) and Glutamate rich protein (Glurp) from Ogun State
      General Hospitals were characterized. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum
      isolates was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism following gel
      electrophoresis of DNA products from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of
      their respective allelic families KI, MAD 20, RO33 (MSP-1);FC27, 3D7 (MSP-2) and 
      Glutamate rich protein respectively. RESULTS: Majority of the patients showed
      monoclonal infections while multiplicity of the infection for msp-1 and msp-2
      were 1.1 and 1.2 respectively. The estimated number of genotypes was 8 msp-1 (4
      KI; 3 MAD; 1 RO33) and 6 msp-2 (3 FC27; 3 3D7). 80% of the isolates coded for
      Glurp with allelic size ranged between 700 and 900 bp. CONCLUSION: The allelic
      distributions however were similar to those previously reported in other endemic 
      malaria countries. Future studies will be designed to include other malaria
      endemic regions of Nigeria such as the oil exploration regions.

TI  - Promoter polymorphisms in the ATP binding cassette transporter gene influence
      production of cell-derived microparticles and are highly associated with
      susceptibility to severe malaria in humans.
PG  - 1287-94
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01175-12 [doi]
AB  - Microparticle (MP) efflux is known to be mediated by the ABCA1 protein, and the
      plasma level of these cell-derived MPs is elevated considerably during human
      malarial infection. Therefore, two polymorphisms at positions -477 and -320 in
      the promoter of the ABCA1 gene were genotyped and tested for association with the
      plasma MP level in four groups of malaria patients segregated according to the
      clinical severity, i.e., cerebral malaria (CM), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD),
      noncerebral severe malaria, and uncomplicated malaria (UM). The TruCount
      tube-based flow cytometric method was used for the exact quantification of
      different cell-derived MPs in patients. Polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene promoter 
      were analyzed by use of the PCR/two-primer-pair method, followed by restriction
      fragment length polymorphism, in 428 malaria patients. The level of circulating
      plasma MPs was significantly higher in febrile patients with Plasmodium
      falciparum infection, especially in CM patients compared to healthy individuals. 
      The homozygous wild-type -477 and -320 genotype was observed to be significantly 
      higher in patients with severe malaria. These patients also showed marked
      increases in the plasma MP numbers compared to UM patients. We report here for
      the first time an association of ABCA1 promoter polymorphisms with susceptibility
      to severe malaria, especially to CM and MOD, indicating the protective effect of 
      the mutant variant of the polymorphism. We hypothesize that the -477T and -320G
      polymorphisms affect the downregulation of MP efflux and may be a predictor of
      organ complication during P. falciparum malarial infections.

PG  - 380-2

AB  - We report four cases of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant
      African women. They had immigrated to Finland 3 to 13 months earlier. The disease
      was revealed only by anemia. The diagnosis relied on blood smear which showed a
      parasitemia <0.2% in three cases. Medical personnel should be informed about the 
      possibility of afebrile forms of malaria in pregnant women even months after
      immigration. Very low levels of parasitemia may call for a more sensitive
      diagnostic approach such as polymerase chain reaction.

TI  - Progress towards malaria elimination in Sabang Municipality, Aceh, Indonesia.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-42 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indonesia has set 2030 as its deadline for elimination of malaria
      transmission in the archipelago, with regional deadlines established according to
      present levels of malaria endemicity and strength of health infrastructure. The
      Municipality of Sabang which historically had one of the highest levels of
      malaria in Aceh province aims to achieve elimination by the end of 2013. METHOD: 
      From 2008 to 2010, baseline surveys of malaria interventions, mapping of all
      confirmed malaria cases, categorization of residual foci of malaria transmission 
      and vector surveys were conducted in Sabang, Aceh, a pilot district for malaria
      elimination in Indonesia. To inform future elimination efforts, mass screening
      from the focal areas to measure prevalence of malaria with both microscopy and
      PCR was conducted. G6PD deficiency prevalence was also measured. RESULT: Despite 
      its small size, a diverse mixture of potential malaria vectors were documented in
      Sabang, including Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles minimus, Anopheles aconitus and 
      Anopheles dirus. Over a two-year span, the number of sub-villages with ongoing
      malaria transmission reduced from 61 to 43. Coverage of malaria diagnosis and
      treatment, IRS, and LLINs was over 80%. Screening of 16,229 residents detected 19
      positive people, for a point prevalence of 0.12%. Of the 19 positive cases, three
      symptomatic infections and five asymptomatic infections were detected with
      microscopy and 11 asymptomatic infections were detected with PCR. Of the 19
      cases, seven were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 11 were infected with
      Plasmodium vivax, and one subject was infected with both species. Analysis of the
      937 blood samples for G6PD deficiency revealed two subjects (0.2%) with deficient
      G6PD. DISCUSSION: The interventions carried out by the government of Sabang have 
      dramatically reduced the burden of malaria over the past seven years. The first
      phase, carried out between 2005 and 2007, included improved malaria diagnosis,
      introduction of ACT for treatment, and scale-up of coverage of IRS and LLINs. The
      second phase, from 2008 to 2010, initiated to eliminate the persistent residual
      transmission of malaria, consisted of development of a malaria database to ensure
      rapid case reporting and investigation, stratification of malaria foci to guide
      interventions, and active case detection to hunt symptomatic and asymptomatic
      malaria carriers.

      infection by etiology and molecular biological methods. 50 microl blood was
      obtained before taking anti-malarial drugs to make thin and thick blood smears,
      Giemsa stained, and observed by microscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from the
      blood sample, and detected for DNA fragment of P. ovale, P. vivax, P. falciparum 
      or P. malariae by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. P. ovale parasites were
      found in both thin and thick blood smears, and confirmed by quantitative PCR.
      With the results of laboratory testing, epidemiological history and clinical
      manifestations, the patient was diagnosed as imported P. ovale infection.

      cases].
PG  - 43-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of the K76T mutation in Pfcrt gene of
      imported Plasmodium falciparum and study the Pfcrt gene polymorphism in
      Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: Seventy-two blood samples were collected from
      patients infected with P. falciparum returning from Africa (Nigeria, Equatorial
      Guinea, Congo, Liberia, Angora and Mali) and Southeast Asia (Myanmar and
      Indonesia) from 2008 to 2012. According to Pfcrt gene sequence of P. falciparum, 
      nested PCR primers were designed, and the reaction was applied with P. falciparum
      DNA in the blood samples as templates. PCR products were identified by Apo I
      digestion. RESULTS: Among 72 blood samples of P. falciparum, mutant Pfcrt alleles
      were found in 41 samples (57.7%, 41/71) and wild type Pfcrt alleles were found in
      30 samples (42.3%, 30/71). There were 25 samples (50%, 25/50) each with mutant
      Pfcrt alleles or wild type that were from Africa, while 16 samples (76.2%, 16/21)
      with mutant Pfcrt alleles and 5 samples (23.8%, 5/21) with wild type that were
      from Southeast Asia, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of Pfcrt gene
      mutation is different in P. falciparum isolates from different regions.

PG  - 33-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone and express Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
      protein 1 DBLalpha (PfEMP1-DBLalpha) and three fragments genes, and screen the
      strongest affinity sequence with the red blood cell surface receptors-heparin or 
      heparin sulfate in the structure of PfEMP1-DBLalpha. METHODS: The sequence of
      PfEMP1-DBLalpha1245 was optimized according to the characteristics of E. coli
      codon, synthesized, and divided into three fragments (DBLaA, DBLalphaB, and
      DBLalphaC) by PCR. Full-length gene and three gene fragments were subcloned into 
      PGEX-4T-1 vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21 and then induced with IPTG
      for expression. The recombinant protein was purified from bacterial lysates using
      glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Heparin affinity test and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
      inhibition test were used to analyze the affinity between recombinant protein and
      heparin. RESULTS: Four recombinant proteins(DBLalpha1245, DBLalphaA, DBLalphaB,
      and DBLalphaC) were expressed as solubility and the relative molecular weight
      (M(r) 73 600, M(r) 41 600, M(r) 42 500, and M(r) 41 500) were conformed to the
      prediction size. Heparin affinity test and GAG inhibition test showed that the
      four recombinant proteins were binded to the heparin-Sepharose, but not for the
      GST control. DBLalphaC (Q285-Y415) had the strongest affinity to heparin.
      CONCLUSION: The strongest affinity sequence with heparin or heparin sulfate in
      the structure of PfEMP1-DBLalpha is Q285-Y415, which plays a role in binding of
      Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells to the peripheral red blood cells.

TI  - Application of a qPCR assay in the investigation of susceptibility to malaria
      infection of the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in Cameroon.
PG  - e54820
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0054820 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease that kills
      almost one million persons each year, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. P. falciparum
      is transmitted to the human host by the bite of an Anopheles female mosquito, and
      Anopheles gambiae sensus stricto is the most tremendous malaria vector in Africa,
      widespread throughout the afro-tropical belt. An. gambiae s.s. is subdivided into
      two distinct molecular forms, namely M and S forms. The two molecular forms are
      morphologically identical but they are distinct genetically, and differ by their 
      distribution and their ecological preferences. The epidemiological importance of 
      the two molecular forms in malaria transmission has been poorly investigated so
      far and gave distinct results in different areas. We have developed a real-time
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, and used it to detect P. falciparum at the oocyst 
      stage in wild An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes experimentally infected with natural
      isolates of parasites. Mosquitoes were collected at immature stages in sympatric 
      and allopatric breeding sites and further infected at the adult stage. We next
      measured the infection prevalence and intensity in female mosquitoes using the
      qPCR assay and correlated the infection success with the mosquito molecular
      forms. Our results revealed different prevalence of infection between the M and S
      molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in Cameroon, for both sympatric and
      allopatric populations of mosquitoes. However, no difference in the infection
      intensity was observed. Thus, the distribution of the molecular forms of An.
      gambiae s.s. may impact on the malaria epidemiology, and it will be important to 
      monitor the efficiency of malaria control interventions on the two M and S forms.

TI  - Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Dakar,
      Senegal: impact on rapid malaria diagnostic tests.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An accurate diagnosis is essential for the rapid and appropriate
      treatment of malaria. The accuracy of the histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based
      rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Palutop+4(R) was assessed here. One possible factor
      contributing to the failure to detect malaria by this test is the diversity of
      the parasite PfHRP2 antigens. METHODS: PfHRP2 detection with the Palutop+4(R) RDT
      was carried out. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes were amplified and sequenced from
      136 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum that were collected in Dakar, Senegal from 
      2009 to 2011. The DNA sequences were determined and statistical analyses of the
      variation observed between these two genes were conducted. The potential impact
      of PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 sequence variation on malaria diagnosis was examined.
      RESULTS: Seven P. falciparum isolates (5.9% of the total isolates, regardless of 
      the parasitaemia; 10.7% of the isolates with parasitaemia </=0.005% or </=250
      parasites/mul) were undetected by the PfHRP2 Palutop+4(R) RDT. Low parasite
      density is not sufficient to explain the PfHRP2 detection failure. Three of these
      seven samples showed pfhrp2 deletion (2.4%). The pfhrp3 gene was deleted in
      12.8%. Of the 122 PfHRP2 sequences, 120 unique sequences were identified. Of the 
      109 PfHRP3 sequences, 64 unique sequences were identified. Using the Baker's
      regression model, at least 7.4% of the P. falciparum isolates in Dakar were
      likely to be undetected by PfHRP2 at a parasite density of </=250 parasites/mul
      (slightly lower than the evaluated prevalence of 10.7%). This predictive
      prevalence increased significantly between 2009 and 2011 (P = 0.0046).
      CONCLUSION: In the present work, 10.7% of the isolates with a parasitaemia
      </=0.005% (</=250 parasites/mul) were undetected by the PfHRP2 Palutop+4(R) RDT
      (7.4% by the predictive Baker'model). In addition, all of the parasites with
      pfhrp2 deletion (2.4% of the total samples) and 2.1% of the parasites with
      parasitaemia >0.005% and presence of pfhrp2 were not detected by PfHRP2 RDT.
      PfHRP2 is highly polymorphic in Senegal. Efforts should be made to more
      accurately determine the prevalence of non-sensitive parasites to pfHRP2.

TI  - High frequency of the erythroid silent Duffy antigen genotype and lack of
      Plasmodium vivax infections in Haiti.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a significant public health concern in Haiti where
      approximately 30,000 cases are reported annually with CDC estimates as high as
      200,000. Malaria infections in Haiti are caused almost exclusively by Plasmodium 
      falciparum, while a small number of Plasmodium malariae and an even smaller
      number of putative Plasmodium vivax infections have been reported. The lack of
      confirmed P. vivax infections in Haiti could be due to the genetic background of 
      native Haitians. Having descended from West African populations, many Haitians
      could be Duffy negative due to a single nucleotide polymorphism from thymine to
      cytosine in the GATA box of the promoter region of the Duffy antigen receptor for
      chemokines (DARC) gene. This mutation, encoded by the FYES allele, eliminates the
      expression of the Duffy antigen on erythrocytes, which reduces invasion by P.
      vivax. This study investigated the frequency of the FYES allele and P. vivax
      infections in malaria patients with the goal of uncovering factors for the lack
      of P. vivax infections reported in Haiti. METHODS: DNA was extracted from dried
      blood spots collected from malaria patients at four clinic locations in Haiti.
      The samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of 
      the P. vivax small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. PCR, sequencing, and restriction
      enzyme digestion were used to detect the presence of the FYES allele. Matched
      samples were examined for both presence of P. vivax and the FYES allele. RESULTS:
      No cases of P. vivax were detected in any of the samples (0/136). Of all samples 
      tested for the FYES allele, 99.4% had the FYES allele (163/164). Of the matched
      samples, 99% had the FYES allele (98/99). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study,
      no cases of P. vivax were confirmed by PCR and 99% of the malaria patients tested
      carried the FYES allele. The high frequency of the FYES allele that silences
      erythroid expression of the Duffy antigen offers a biologically plausible
      explanation for the lack of P. vivax infections observed. These results provide
      insights on the host susceptibility for P. vivax infections that has never before
      been investigated in Haiti.

TI  - Evaluation of the sensitivity of a pLDH-based and an aldolase-based rapid
      diagnostic test for diagnosis of uncomplicated and severe malaria caused by
      PCR-confirmed Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium vivax.
PG  - 1118-23
LID - 10.1128/JCM.03285-12 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi can cause severe and fatal human malaria in Southeast Asia.
      Rapid diagnosis of all Plasmodium species is essential for initiation of
      effective treatment. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are sensitive for detection of
      uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria but have not been systematically
      evaluated in knowlesi malaria. At a tertiary referral hospital in Sabah,
      Malaysia, we prospectively evaluated the sensitivity of two combination RDTs for 
      the diagnosis of uncomplicated and severe malaria from all three potentially
      fatal Plasmodium species, using a pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-P. 
      falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) RDT (First Response) and a
      pan-Plasmodium aldolase-PfHRP2 RDT (ParaHIT). Among 293 hospitalized adults with 
      PCR-confirmed Plasmodium monoinfection, the sensitivity of the pLDH component of 
      the pLDH-PfHRP2 RDT was 74% (95/129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65 to 80%),
      91% (110/121; 95% CI, 84 to 95%), and 95% (41/43; 95% CI, 85 to 99%) for
      PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi, P. falciparum, and P. vivax infections, respectively, 
      and 88% (30/34; 95% CI, 73 to 95%), 90% (38/42; 95% CI, 78 to 96%), and 100%
      (12/12; 95% CI, 76 to 100%) among patients tested before antimalarial treatment
      was begun. Sensitivity in severe malaria was 95% (36/38; 95% CI, 83 to 99), 100% 
      (13/13; 95% CI, 77 to 100), and 100% (7/7; 95% CI, 65 to 100%), respectively. The
      aldolase component of the aldolase-PfHRP2 RDT performed poorly in all Plasmodium 
      species. The pLDH-based RDT was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of severe
      malaria from all species; however, neither the pLDH- nor aldolase-based RDT
      demonstrated sufficiently high overall sensitivity for P. knowlesi. More
      sensitive RDTs are needed in regions of P. knowlesi endemicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nested PCR is a commonly used technique in diagnosis of malaria owing
      to its high sensitivity and specificity. However, it is time-consuming, open to
      considerable risk of contamination and has low cost-efficiency. Using
      amplification targets presented in multiple copies, such as rRNA 18S, or
      mitochondrial targets with an even higher copy number, might increase
      sensitivity. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of two newly designed
      Plasmodium genus-specific single-round amplification PCR programmes, based on
      previously published primers targeting 18S and mitochondrial genome, were
      compared with a widely used nested 18S PCR. Analyses of dilution series from
      Plasmodium falciparum reference material were performed, as well as retrospective
      analyses of 135 blood samples, evaluated by routine microscopy, from 132 fever
      patients with potential imported malaria. Sequencing of the 220 bp mitochondrial 
      PCR products was performed. RESULTS: At the threshold dilution 0.5 parasites/mul,
      the sensitivity of the mitochondrial PCR was 97% (29/30 parallels), that of the
      single-round 18S PCR 93% and the reference nested 18S PCR 87%. All three assays
      detected as low as 0.05 p/mul, though not consistently. In the patient cohort,
      malaria was diagnosed in 21% (28/135) samples, defined as positive by at least
      two methods. Both single-round amplification assays identified all malaria
      positives diagnosed by nested PCR that had sensitivity of 96% (27/28). The
      mitochondrial PCR detected one additional sample, also positive by microscopy,
      and was the only method with 100% sensitivity (28/28). The sensitivity and
      specificity of the mitochondrial PCR were statistically non-inferior to that of
      the reference nested PCR. Microscopy missed two infections detected by all PCR
      assays. Sequencing of the genus-specific mitochondrial PCR products revealed
      different single nucleotide polymorphisms which allowed species identification of
      the 28 sequences with following distribution; 20 P. falciparum, six Plasmodium
      vivax, one Plasmodium ovale and one Plasmodium malariae. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, design of PCR programmes with suitable parameters and optimization
      resulted in simpler and faster single-round amplification assays. Both
      sensitivity and specificity of the novel mitochondrial PCR was 100% and proved
      non-inferior to that of the reference nested PCR. Sequencing of genus-specific
      mitochondrial PCR products could be used for species determination.

AB  - Molecular methods elucidate evolutionary and ecological processes in parasites,
      where interaction between hosts and parasites enlighten the evolution of parasite
      lifestyles and host defenses. Population genetics of Plasmodium vivax parasites
      accurately describe transmission dynamics of the parasites and evaluation of
      malaria control measures. As a first generation vaccine candidate against
      malaria, the Circumsporozoite Protein (CSP) has demonstrated significant
      potential in P. falciparum. Extensive polymorphism hinders the development of a
      potent malaria vaccine. Hence, the genetic diversity of Pvcsp was investigated
      for the first time in 60 Sri Lankan clinical isolates by obtaining the nucleotide
      sequence of the central repeat (CR) domain and examining the polymorphism of the 
      peptide repeat motifs (PRMs), the genetic diversity indices and phylogenetic
      relationships. PCR amplicons determined size polymorphism of 610, 700 and 710 bp 
      in Pvcsp of Sri Lanka where all amino acid sequences obtained were of the VK210
      variant, consisting variable repeats of 4 different PRMs. The two most abundant
      PRMs of the CR domain, GDRADGQPA and GDRAAGQPA consisted ~2-4 repeats, while
      GNRAAGQPA was unique to the island. Though, different nucleotide sequences termed
      repeat allotypes (RATs) were observed for each PRM, these were synonymous
      contributing to a less polymorphic CR domain. The genetic diversity of Pvcsp in
      Sri Lanka was due to the number of repetitive peptide repeat motifs, point
      mutations, and intragenic recombination. The 19 amino acid haplotypes defined
      were exclusive to Sri Lanka, whereas the 194 Pvcsp sequences of global isolates
      generated 57 more distinct a.a. haplotypes of the VK210 variant. Strikingly, the 
      CR domain of both VK210 and VK247 variants was under purifying selection
      interpreting the scarcity of CSP non-synonymous polymorphisms. Insights to the
      distribution of RATs in the CR region with geographic clustering of the P. vivax 
      VK210 variant were revealed. The cladogram reiterated this unique geographic
      clustering of local (VK210) and global isolates (VK210 and VK247), which was
      further validated by the elevated fixation index values of the VK210 variant.

TI  - A simple Chelex protocol for DNA extraction from Anopheles spp.
LID - 10.3791/3281 [doi]
LID - 3281 [pii]
AB  - Endemic countries are increasingly adopting molecular tools for efficient typing,
      identification and surveillance against malaria parasites and vector mosquitoes, 
      as an integral part of their control programs. For sustainable establishment of
      these accurate approaches in operations research to strengthen malaria control
      and elimination efforts, simple and affordable methods, with parsimonious reagent
      and equipment requirements are essential. Here we present a simple Chelex-based
      technique for extracting malaria parasite and vector DNA from field collected
      mosquito specimens. We morphologically identified 72 Anopheles gambiae sl. from
      156 mosquitoes captured by pyrethrum spray catches in sleeping rooms of
      households within a 2,000 km(2) vicinity of the Malaria Institute at Macha. After
      dissection to separate the head and thorax from the abdomen for all 72 Anopheles 
      gambiae sl. mosquitoes, the two sections were individually placed in 1.5 ml
      microcentrifuge tubes and submerged in 20 mul of deionized water. Using a sterile
      pipette tip, each mosquito section was separately homogenized to a uniform
      suspension in the deionized water. Of the ensuing homogenate from each mosquito
      section, 10 mul was retained while the other 10 mul was transferred to a separate
      autoclaved 1.5 ml tube. The separate aliquots were subjected to DNA extraction by
      either the simplified Chelex or the standard salting out extraction
      protocol(9,10). The salting out protocol is so-called and widely used because it 
      employs high salt concentrations in lieu of hazardous organic solvents (such as
      phenol and chloroform) for the protein precipitation step during DNA
      extraction(9). Extracts were used as templates for PCR amplification using
      primers targeting arthropod mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      dehydrogenase (NADH) subunit 4 gene (ND4) to check DNA quality, a PCR for
      identification of Anopheles gambiae sibling species(10) and a nested PCR for
      typing of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Comparison using DNA quality (ND4) PCR
      showed 93% sensitivity and 82% specificity for the Chelex approach relative to
      the established salting out protocol. Corresponding values of sensitivity and
      specificity were 100% and 78%, respectively, using sibling species identification
      PCR and 92% and 80%, respectively for P. falciparum detection PCR. There were no 
      significant differences in proportion of samples giving amplicon signal with the 
      Chelex or the regular salting out protocol across all three PCR applications. The
      Chelex approach required three simple reagents and 37 min to complete, while the 
      salting out protocol entailed 10 different reagents and 2 hr and 47 min'
      processing time, including an overnight step. Our results show that the Chelex
      method is comparable to the existing salting out extraction and can be
      substituted as a simple and sustainable approach in resource-limited settings
      where a constant reagent supply chain is often difficult to maintain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the most important cause of mortality and morbidity in
      children living in the Kintampo districts in the middle part of Ghana. This study
      has investigated the multiplicity of infection (MOI) within asymptomatic
      residents of the Kintampo districts, and the influence of age and seasonality on 
      MOI, by studying the distribution of the polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum
      antigen merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2). METHODS: DNA was extracted from an
      asymptomatic cohort of children and adults infected with P. falciparum during the
      period November 2003 to October 2004. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out
      and multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined. RESULTS: Children under 10
      years of age had an average MOI of 2.3 while adults 18 years and above had an
      average MOI of 1.4. Children below five years had high and low average MOIs of
      2.8 in the March/April survey and 0.9 in the May/June survey respectively. A
      similar trend in the monthly distribution of MOI was observed for the entire
      cohort. IC/3D7 strains outnumbered the FC27 strains throughout the year by a
      ratio of about 4:1 with the difference between the prevalence of the two strains 
      being least marked in the March/April survey, at the beginning of the rainy
      season. MOI was not linked to the level of malaria transmission as measured by
      the entomological inoculation rate. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The impact of
      interventions, introduced since this baseline study was carried out on the
      parasite diversity of asymptomatic residents will be the subject of further
      investigations.

AB  - The Republic of the Congo adopted artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) 
      in 2006: artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine as the first-line and
      second-line drugs, respectively. The baseline efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine
      was evaluated between March and July 2006 in Brazzaville, the capital city of
      Congo. Seventy-seven children aged between 6 months and 10 years were enrolled in
      a nonrandomized study. The children were treated under supervision with 6 doses
      of artemether-lumefantrine and followed up for 28 days in accordance with the
      2003 World Health Organization guideline. Pretreatment (i.e., day 0) and
      recrudescent Plasmodium falciparum isolates between day 14 and day 28 were
      compared by the polymerase chain reaction to distinguish between true
      recrudescence and reinfection. The overall cure rate on day 28 was 96.9% after
      PCR correction. Reported adverse effects included pruritus and dizziness.
      Artemether-lumefantrine was highly efficacious in Brazzaville.

TI  - Prevalence of congenital malaria in high-risk Ghanaian newborns: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital malaria is defined as malaria parasitaemia in the first
      week of life. The reported prevalence of congenital malaria in sub-Saharan Africa
      is variable (0 - 46%). Even though the clinical significance of congenital
      malaria parasitaemia is uncertain, anti-malarial drugs are empirically prescribed
      for sick newborns by frontline health care workers. Data on prevalence of
      congenital malaria in high-risk newborns will inform appropriate drug use and
      timely referral of sick newborns. METHODS: Blood samples of untreated newborns
      less than 1 week of age at the time of referral to Korle Bu Teaching hospital in 
      Accra, Ghana during the peak malaria seasons (April to July) of 2008 and 2010
      were examined for malaria parasites by, i) Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood
      smears for parasite count and species identification, ii) histidine-rich protein-
      and lactic dehydrogenase-based rapid diagnosis tests, or iii) polymerase chain
      reaction amplification of the merozoite surface protein 2 gene, for
      identification of sub-microscopic parasitaemia. Other investigations were also
      done as clinically indicated. RESULTS: In 2008, nine cases of Plasmodium
      falciparum parasitaemia were diagnosed by microscopy in 405 (2.2%) newborns. All 
      the nine newborns had low parasite densities (</= 50 per microlitre). In 2010,
      there was no case of parasitaemia by either microscopy or rapid diagnosis tests
      in 522 newborns; however, 56/467 (12%) cases of P. falciparum were detected by
      polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Congenital malaria is an uncommon cause of
      clinical illness in high-risk untreated newborns referred to a tertiary hospital 
      in the first week of life. Empirical anti-malarial drug treatment for sick
      newborns without laboratory confirmation of parasitaemia is imprudent. Early
      referral of sick newborns to hospitals with resources and skills for appropriate 
      care is recommended.

AB  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Plasmodium vivax is problematic due to the
      reliance on clinical isolates which are generally low in parasitaemia and sample 
      volume. Furthermore, clinical isolates contain a significant contaminating
      background of host DNA which confounds efforts to map short read sequence of the 
      target P. vivax DNA. Here, we discuss a methodology to significantly improve the 
      success of P. vivax WGS on natural (non-adapted) patient isolates. Using 37
      patient isolates from Indonesia, Thailand, and travellers, we assessed the
      application of CF11-based white blood cell filtration alone and in combination
      with short term ex vivo schizont maturation. Although CF11 filtration reduced
      human DNA contamination in 8 Indonesian isolates tested, additional short-term
      culture increased the P. vivax DNA yield from a median of 0.15 to 6.2 ng
      microl(-1) packed red blood cells (pRBCs) (p = 0.001) and reduced the human DNA
      percentage from a median of 33.9% to 6.22% (p = 0.008). Furthermore, post-CF11
      and culture samples from Thailand gave a median P. vivax DNA yield of 2.34 ng
      microl(-1) pRBCs, and 2.65% human DNA. In 22 P. vivax patient isolates prepared
      with the 2-step method, we demonstrate high depth (median 654X coverage) and
      breadth (>/=89%) of coverage on the Illumina GAII and HiSeq platforms. In
      contrast to the A+T-rich P. falciparum genome, negligible bias was observed in
      coverage depth between coding and non-coding regions of the P. vivax genome. This
      uniform coverage will greatly facilitate the detection of SNPs and copy number
      variants across the genome, enabling unbiased exploration of the natural
      diversity in P. vivax populations.

AB  - Infections with organisms that are resistant to various anti-microbial agents
      pose a serious challenge to effective management of infections. Resistance to
      antimicrobial agents, which may be intrinsic or acquired, has been noted in a
      wide variety of microorganisms causing human infections. These include resistance
      to antiviral agents in HIV, HBV, CMV and influenza virus, anti-parasitic agents
      in Plasmodium falciparum, anti-fungal agents in certain Candida species and MDR
      (multidrug-resistant) tuberculosis. It is however, the problem of
      multidrug-resistant bacterial infections (caused by MRSA, VRE,
      ESBL/AmpC/metallo-beta lactamase producers and colistin-resistant Gram-negative
      bacilli) that has become a cause of major concern in clinical settings.
      Infections with these organisms can increase morbidity, mortality, increase the
      cost of therapy and increase the duration of hospitalization. The objective of
      this article is to review the question how early diagnosis of these infections,
      affects the overall management of infected or colonized patients, with regard to 
      antimicrobial therapy.

TI  - Artesunate + amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Colombian Pacific region: a
      noninferiority trial.
PG  - 732-8
LID - S0037-86822012000600015 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Colombia, there are no published studies for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria comparing artemisinin combination
      therapies. Hence, it is intended to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy/safety 
      profiles of artesunate + amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine treatments.
      METHODS: A randomized, controlled, open-label, noninferiority (Delta</=5%)
      clinical trial was performed in adults with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria
      using the 28-day World Health Organization validated design/definitions. Patients
      were randomized 1:1 to either oral artesunate + amodiaquine or
      artemether-lumefantrine. The primary efficacy endpoint: adequate clinical and
      parasitological response; secondary endpoints: - treatment failures defined per
      the World Health Organization. SAFETY: assessed through adverse events. RESULTS: 
      A total of 105 patients was included in each group: zero censored observations.
      Mean (95%CI - Confidence interval) adequate clinical and parasitological response
      rates: 100% for artesunate + amodiaquine and 99% for artemether-lumefantrine; the
      noninferiority criteria was met (Delta=1.7%). There was one late parasitological 
      therapeutic failure (1%; artemether-lumefantrine group), typified by polymerase
      chain reaction as the MAD20 MSP1 allele. The fever clearance time (artesunate +
      amodiaquine group) was significantly shorter (p=0.002). Respectively, abdominal
      pain for artesunate + amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine was 1.9% and 3.8%
      at baseline (p=0.68) and 1% and 13.3% after treatment (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treatment with artesunate + amodiaquine is
      noninferior to the artemether-lumefantrine standard treatment. The
      efficacy/safety profiles grant further studies in this and similar populations.

TI  - Limitations of microscopy to differentiate Plasmodium species in a region
      co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In areas co-endemic for multiple Plasmodium species, correct
      diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment and surveillance. Species
      misidentification by microscopy has been reported in areas co-endemic for vivax
      and falciparum malaria, and may be more frequent in regions where Plasmodium
      knowlesi also commonly occurs. METHODS: This prospective study in Sabah,
      Malaysia, evaluated the accuracy of routine district and referral hospital-based 
      microscopy, and microscopy performed by an experienced research microscopist, for
      the diagnosis of PCR-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum, P. knowlesi, and Plasmodium
      vivax malaria. RESULTS: A total of 304 patients with PCR-confirmed Plasmodium
      infection were enrolled, including 130 with P. knowlesi, 122 with P. falciparum, 
      43 with P. vivax, one with Plasmodium malariae and eight with mixed species
      infections. Among patients with P. knowlesi mono-infection, routine and
      cross-check microscopy both identified 94 (72%) patients as "P. malariae/P.
      knowlesi"; 17 (13%) and 28 (22%) respectively were identified as P. falciparum,
      and 13 (10%) and two (1.5%) as P. vivax. Among patients with PCR-confirmed P.
      falciparum, routine and cross-check microscopy identified 110/122 (90%) and
      112/118 (95%) patients respectively as P. falciparum, and 8/122 (6.6%) and 5/118 
      (4.2%) as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi". Among those with P. vivax, 23/43 (53%) and
      34/40 (85%) were correctly diagnosed by routine and cross-check microscopy
      respectively, while 13/43 (30%) and 3/40 (7.5%) patients were diagnosed as "P.
      malariae/P. knowlesi". Four of 13 patients with PCR-confirmed P. vivax and
      misdiagnosed by routine microscopy as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi" were subsequently
      re-admitted with P. vivax malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Microscopy does not reliably
      distinguish between P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi in a region where all
      three species frequently occur. Misdiagnosis of P. knowlesi as both P. vivax and 
      P. falciparum, and vice versa, is common, potentially leading to inappropriate
      treatment, including chloroquine therapy for P. falciparum and a lack of
      anti-relapse therapy for P. vivax. The limitations of microscopy in P.
      knowlesi-endemic areas supports the use of unified blood-stage treatment
      strategies for all Plasmodium species, the development of accurate rapid
      diagnostic tests suitable for all species, and the use of PCR-confirmation for
      accurate surveillance.

PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is becoming an alternative way of
      establishing quickly the diagnosis of malaria infections, by detecting specific
      malaria antigens in suspected patients' blood between the China-Myanmar endemic
      borders areas, towards achieving the National Malaria Elimination programme by
      2020. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of CareStart
      Malaria Pf/Pan RDT kit for the diagnosis of malaria infections in suspected
      patients. Blood examination by microscopy was taken as gold standard to evaluate 
      CareStart kit's sensitivity, specificity and predictive value and corrected with 
      PCR assay. RESULTS: Overall 126 of 241 (52.28%) malaria cases were detected by
      microscopy compared to 115 of 241(47.72%) CareStart kit and 128 of 241 (53.11%)
      PCR corrected assay. CareStart kit's sensitivity and specificity for the
      diagnosis of malaria were 89.68% and 98.26% respectively, compared to standard
      microscopy, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for falciparum malaria were
      88.52% and 98.26%, and for vivax malaria: 90.77% and 100%. The CareStart positive
      predictive values were 98.26% (93.88-99.52%, 95% CI) compared to 100%
      (96.77-100%, 95% CI) for PCR-corrected, and the negative predictive values of
      89.68% (83.15-93.87%, 95% CI) were the same in microscopy as PCR-corrected. The
      diagnostic accuracy of CareStart kit versus microscopy and PCR were 93.78%
      (89.99-96.19%, 95% CI) and 94.61% (90.99-96.82%, 95% CI) respectively. The
      likelihood of diagnostic of malaria positive was almost similar between
      microscopy and CareStart kit, with an entropy reduction of 60.0% compared to a
      weak likelihood of misdiagnosis of 0.10 (0.09-0.12, 95% CI), with an entropy
      reduction of 36.01%. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of CareStart kit is comparable to
      gold standard microscopy in these areas, it is easy to perform and suitable for
      cross-border diagnosis and monitoring of local or imported malaria patterns by
      any local health staff in endemic remotes.

AB  - The emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to the commonly used 
      anti-malarial drugs is a major challenge in the control and elimination of
      malaria. The present study provides information on genetic analysis in multidrug 
      resistance 1 (pfmdr1) (N86Y/Y184F/S1034C/N1042D/F1226Y/D1246Y) and multidrug

      transporter (pfcrt) 76T in P. falciparum clinical isolates (N=200) exposed to
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) 4years after its adoption in Iran.
      Also, the copy number of pfmdr1 gene was screened for its association with pfmdr1
      mutations to incriminate artemisinin resistance. By using nested PCR-RFLP and
      sequencing analysis, none of the samples had any mutation at codons 1034, 1042,
      1226 and 1246 of pfmdr1, while 86Y and 184F mutations were detected in 46% and 2%
      of the examined samples, respectively. Also, no significant difference was
      identified among analyzed samples collected before (baseline, 2002-2005) and
      after adoption of ACT (2007-2010) (P>0.05). As with pfmrp1 gene, the mutations at
      positions 191Y (76.5%), 437A (69.5%), 876V (64.5%) and 1390I (17%) were detected 
      and no samples displayed mutation at codon 1466R. In total, 42.5% of the examined
      isolates carried both pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T and none of the parasites
      simultaneously harbored pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1 86Y, 184F and pfmrp1 191Y, 437A, 876V, 
      1390I mutations. In addition, the copy number of pfmdr1 gene (N = 1) was similar 
      as a sensitive isolate, 3D7, to artemisinin. In summary, none of the potential
      mutations associated with artemisinin and its derivatives resistance was
      significantly changed 4years after adoption of ACT in Iran.

      parasites detection in malaria vectors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An accurate method for detecting malaria parasites in the mosquito's 
      vector remains an essential component in the vector control. The Enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay specific for circumsporozoite protein (ELISA-CSP) is the gold
      standard method for the detection of malaria parasites in the vector even if it
      presents some limitations. Here, we optimized multiplex real-time PCR assays to
      accurately detect minor populations in mixed infection with multiple Plasmodium
      species in the African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus. 
      METHODS: Complementary TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays that detect Plasmodium
      species using specific primers and probes were first evaluated on artificial
      mixtures of different targets inserted in plasmid constructs. The assays were
      further validated in comparison with the ELISA-CSP on 200 field caught Anopheles 
      gambiae and Anopheles funestus mosquitoes collected in two localities in southern
      Benin. RESULTS: The validation of the duplex real-time PCR assays on the plasmid 
      mixtures demonstrated robust specificity and sensitivity for detecting distinct
      targets. Using a panel of mosquito specimen, the real-time PCR showed a
      relatively high sensitivity (88.6%) and specificity (98%), compared to ELISA-CSP 
      as the referent standard. The agreement between both methods was "excellent"
      (kappa=0.8, P<0.05). The relative quantification of Plasmodium DNA between the
      two Anopheles species analyzed showed no significant difference (P=0, 2). All
      infected mosquito samples contained Plasmodium falciparum DNA and mixed
      infections with P. malariae and/or P. ovale were observed in 18.6% and 13.6% of
      An. gambiae and An. funestus respectively. Plasmodium vivax was found in none of 
      the mosquito samples analyzed. CONCLUSION: This study presents an optimized
      method for detecting the four Plasmodium species in the African malaria vectors. 
      The study highlights substantial discordance with traditional ELISA-CSP pointing 
      out the utility of employing an accurate molecular diagnostic tool for detecting 
      malaria parasites in field mosquito populations.

LID - 10.2471/BLT.12.109124 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe India's National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring
      System, measure the efficacy of first-line malaria treatments, and determine risk
      factors for treatment failure. METHODS: In 2009-2010, prospective studies with 28
      days of follow-up were conducted at 25 sentinel sites. Patients infected with
      Plasmodium falciparum were given artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (AS+SP); those infected with P. vivax were given chloroquine. Polymerase chain
      reaction was used to distinguish post-treatment reinfection from treatment
      failure. Isolates of P. falciparum were checked for dhfr and dhps mutations.
      FINDINGS: Overall, 1664 patients were enrolled. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
      showed an efficacy of 98.8% for AS+SP. Most patients with P. falciparum
      parasitaemia cleared their parasitaemias within 24 hours of treatment initiation,
      but six, including four with treatment failure, remained parasitaemic after 72
      hours. Double mutants in dhfr were found in 68.4% of the genotyped isolates.
      Triple or quadruple mutants in dhfr and mutations in dhps were rare. A daily dose
      of artesunate of < 3 mg per kg of body weight, age of less than 5 years, and
      fever at enrolment were associated with an increased risk of treatment failure.
      Chloroquine remained 100% efficacious and generally cleared P. vivax
      parasitaemias within 48 hours. Vomiting (seen in 47 patients) was the most common
      adverse event. CONCLUSION: India's National Antimalarial Drug Resistance
      Monitoring System provides wide coverage. The first-line antimalarials used in
      the country remain safe and efficacious. The treatment of malaria in young
      children and the relative benefits of age- and weight-based dosing need further
      exploration.

AB  - The presence of foreign contamination, especially of mycoplasmas, is a major
      hindrance in long term in vitro cultivation of Plasmodium falciparum and may be a
      source of false-positive results. Efforts have been made to control mycoplasma
      contamination by trypsinization of P. falciparum culture. Samples of accidentally
      contaminated cultures were used for this study. The presence of Mycoplasma orale 
      in contaminated culture was ascertained by a species-specific PCR-based
      mycoplasma detection kit (Takara; Cat. No.6601). Trypsinization was carried out
      using trypsin-EDTA and the growth profile of P. falciparum was monitored for more
      than three weeks post-trypsinization. The studies were carried out with four
      different P. falciparum strains, various serum supplements and human erythrocytes
      belonging to different blood groups. It was interesting to observe that,
      irrespective of the different strains of P. falciparum and the variety of serum
      supplements and erythrocytes, mycoplasma contamination can successfully be
      removed from P. falciparum culture by trypsinization. No antibiotic except
      gentamicin, which is routinely used, was added to the medium. Results of this
      study indicate that the frequent appearance of mycoplasma in continuous long-term
      cultures of P. falciparum can be managed by trypsinization.

TI  - Assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the
      treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in northern
      KwaZulu-Natal: an observational cohort study.
PG  - 434
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-434 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent malaria epidemics in KwaZulu-Natal indicate that effective
      anti-malarial therapy is essential for malaria control. Although
      artemether-lumefantrine has been used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in northern KwaZulu-Natal since 2001, its efficacy 
      has not been assessed since 2002. The objectives of this study were to quantify
      the proportion of patients treated for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria with
      artemether-lumefantrine who failed treatment after 28 days, and to determine the 
      prevalence of molecular markers associated with artemether-lumefantrine and
      chloroquine resistance. METHODS: An observational cohort of 49 symptomatic
      patients, diagnosed with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria by rapid diagnostic 
      test, had blood taken for malaria blood films and P. falciparum DNA polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Following diagnosis, patients were treated with
      artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) and invited to return to the health facility
      after 28 days for repeat blood film and PCR. All PCR P. falciparum positive
      samples were analysed for molecular markers of lumefantrine and chloroquine
      resistance. RESULTS: Of 49 patients recruited on the basis of a positive rapid
      diagnostic test, only 16 were confirmed to have P. falciparum by PCR. At
      follow-up, 14 were PCR-negative for malaria, one was lost to follow-up and one
      blood specimen had insufficient blood for a PCR analysis. All 16 with
      PCR-confirmed malaria carried a single copy of the multi-drug resistant (mdr1)
      gene, and the wild type asparagine allele mdr1 codon 86 (mdr1 86N). Ten of the 16
      samples carried the wild type haplotype (CVMNK) at codons 72-76 of the
      chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt); three samples carried the
      resistant CVIET allele; one carried both the resistant and wild type, and in two 
      samples the allele could not be analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of mdr1 gene
      copy number variation detected in this study suggests lumefantrine resistance has
      yet to emerge in KwaZulu-Natal. In addition, data from this investigation implies
      the possible re-emergence of chloroquine-sensitive parasites. Results from this
      study must be viewed with caution, given the extremely small sample size. A
      larger study is needed to accurately determine therapeutic efficacy of
      artemether-lumefantrine and resistance marker prevalence. The high proportion of 
      rapid diagnostic test false-positive results requires further investigation.

      case-control etiologic study.
PG  - e1972
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few detailed etiologic studies of severe anemia in children
      from malaria-endemic areas and none in those countries with holoendemic
      transmission of multiple Plasmodium species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
      examined associates of severe anemia in 143 well-characterized Papua New Guinean 
      (PNG) children aged 0.5-10 years with hemoglobin concentration <50 g/L (median
      [inter-quartile range] 39 [33]-[44] g/L) and 120 matched healthy children (113
      [107-119] g/L) in a case-control cross-sectional study. A range of
      socio-demographic, behavioural, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory
      (including genetic) variables were incorporated in multivariate models with
      severe anemia as dependent variable. Consistent with a likely trophic effect of
      chloroquine or amodiaquine on parvovirus B19 (B19V) replication, B19V PCR/IgM
      positivity had the highest odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 75.8
      (15.4-526), followed by P. falciparum infection (19.4 (6.7-62.6)), vitamin A
      deficiency (13.5 (5.4-37.7)), body mass index-for-age z-score <2.0 (8.4
      (2.7-27.0)) and incomplete vaccination (2.94 (1.3-7.2)). P. vivax infection was
      inversely associated (0.12 (0.02-0.47), reflecting early acquisition of immunity 
      and/or a lack of reticulocytes for parasite invasion. After imputation of missing
      data, iron deficiency was a weak positive predictor (6.4% of population
      attributable risk). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data show that severe anemia 
      is multifactorial in PNG children, strongly associated with under-nutrition and
      certain common infections, and potentially preventable through vitamin A
      supplementation and improved nutrition, completion of vaccination schedules, and 
      intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment using
      non-chloroquine/amodiaquine-based regimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre study was carried out in Cameroon, Ivory Coast and
      Senegal to evaluate the non-inferiority of the new paediatric formulation of
      artesunate/amodiaquine (AS+AQ)(Camoquin-Plus Paediatric(R)) in suspension form
      versus artemether/lumefantrine (AL)(Coartem(R)) in the management of African
      children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. METHODS: It was an open
      randomized trial including children aged between 7 months and 7 years. The
      endpoints were Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) at day 28,
      the clinical and biological tolerability. Statistical analyses were done in
      Intention To Treat (ITT) and in Per protocol (PP). RESULTS: At the end of the
      study 481 patients were enrolled in the three countries (249 in the AS+AQ arm and
      232 in the AL arm). ACRP in ITT after PCR correction did not show any statistical
      difference between the two groups with 97.6% for AS+AQ versus 94.8% for AL. In
      the PP analysis, the corrected ACRP were respectively 98.7% and 96.9% for the two
      regimens. The clinical tolerance was good without significant difference. Anaemia
      was significantly higher at D7 in the two groups compared to D0. CONCLUSION: This
      study demonstrates the non-inferiority of AS+AQ versus AL, its efficacy and
      tolerance in the management of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      African children.

AB  - Research into the aetiological agent of the most widespread form of severe
      malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has benefitted enormously from the ability to
      culture and genetically manipulate blood-stage forms of the parasite in vitro.
      However, most malaria outside Africa is caused by a distinct Plasmodium species, 
      Plasmodium vivax, and it has become increasingly apparent that zoonotic infection
      by the closely related simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is a frequent cause of
      life-threatening malaria in regions of southeast Asia. Neither of these important
      malarial species can be cultured in human cells in vitro, requiring access to
      primates with the associated ethical and practical constraints. We report the
      successful adaptation of P. knowlesi to continuous culture in human erythrocytes.
      Human-adapted P. knowlesi clones maintain their capacity to replicate in monkey
      erythrocytes and can be genetically modified with unprecedented efficiency,
      providing an important and unique model for studying conserved aspects of
      malarial biology as well as species-specific features of an emerging pathogen.

AB  - This study was carried out to determine the human host preference and presence of
      Plasmodium parasite in field collected Anopheles mosquitoes among four villages
      around a military cantonment located in malaria endemic Sonitpur district of
      Assam, India. Encountered malaria vector mosquitoes were identified and tested
      for host preference and Plasmodium presence using PCR method. Human host
      preference was detected using simple PCR, whereas vectorial status for Plasmodium
      parasite was confirmed using first round PCR with genus specific primers and
      thereafter nested PCR with three Plasmodium species specific primers. Out of 1874
      blood fed vector mosquitoes collected, 187 (10%) were processed for PCR, which
      revealed that 40.6% had fed on human blood; 9.2% of human blood fed mosquito were
      harbouring Plasmodium parasites, 71.4% of which were confirmed to Plasmodium
      falciparum. In addition to An. minimus, An. annularis and An. culicifacies were
      also found positive for malaria parasites. The present study exhibits the human
      feeding tendency of Anopheles vectors highlighting their malaria parasite
      transmission potential. The present study may serve as a model for understanding 
      the human host preference of malaria vectors and detection of malaria parasite
      inside the anopheline vector mosquitoes in order to update their vectorial status
      for estimating the possible role of these mosquitoes in malaria transmission. The
      study has used PCR method and suggests that PCR-based method should be used in
      this entire malarious region to correctly report the vectorial position of
      different malaria vectors.

      profile among Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive individuals.
PG  - 430
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is large body of evidence that states that invasion of
      Plasmodium vivax requires the Duffy antigen, but the universality of this
      specificity is certainly now under question with recent reports showing that in
      some parts of the world P. vivax infects and causes disease in Duffy-negative
      people. These findings reinforce the idea that this parasite is rapidly evolving,
      being able to use other receptors than Duffy to invade the erythrocytes, which
      may have an enormous impact in P. vivax current distribution. The presence of P. 
      vivax infection in Duffy-negative individuals was investigated in a
      cross-sectional study conducted in Anajas, Archipelago of Marajo, State of Para, 
      which is an area of malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazonia. METHODS:
      Duffy genotyping and Plasmodium species diagnostic assays were performed
      successfully in 678 individuals. An allele-specific primer polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) technique was used for Duffy blood group genotyping.
      Identification of Plasmodium species was achieved by conventional blood smear
      light microscopy and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR method to detect mitochondrial 
      genome of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. RESULTS: Plasmodium spp. infection 
      was detected in 137 samples (20.2%). Prevalence of each Plasmodium species was
      13.9% P. vivax, 5.8% P. falciparum, and 0.6% P. vivax plus P. falciparum.
      Overall, 4.3% (29/678) were genotyped as Duffy-negative (FY*BES/*BES). Among
      Duffy-negative individuals 6.9% were P. vivax PCR positive and among
      Duffy-positive 14.2% were P. vivax PCR positive. Although lower, the risk of
      Duffy-negatives to experience a P. vivax blood stage infection was not
      significantly different to that of Duffy-positives. Furthermore, the genotypic
      and allelic frequencies of the Duffy blood group among P. vivax-infected patients
      and in the control group did not differ significantly, also suggesting no
      reduction in infection rates among the carriers of FY*BES allele. CONCLUSIONS:
      The data obtained in Anajas showed no differential resistance vivax malaria among
      Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive individuals. This result needs additional
      confirmation through a deeper evaluation in a larger sample of patients with P.
      vivax malaria and molecular parasite characterization. Nonetheless, this genetic 
      profile of the parasite may be contributing to the high incidence of malaria in
      the municipality.

AB  - We screened for malaria in 594 blood samples from febrile patients who tested
      negative by a Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein-2-based rapid
      diagnostic test at 12 health facilities in Zanzibar districts North A and
      Micheweni, from May to August 2010. Screening was with microscopy, polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cytochrome b gene (cytbPCR) of the four major 
      human malaria species, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of
      cytbPCR-detectable malaria infection was 2% (12 of 594), including 8 P.
      falciparum, 3 Plasmodium malariae, and 1 Plasmodium vivax infections. Microscopy 
      identified 4 of 8 P. falciparum infections. Parasite density as estimated by
      microscopy or qPCR was > 4,000 parasites/muL in 5 of 8 cytbPCR-detectable P.
      falciparum infections. The infections that were missed by the rapid diagnostic
      test represent a particular challenge in malaria elimination settings and
      highlight the need for more sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tools to improve
      case detection of all human malaria species in febrile patients.

AB  - The first reported case of natural transmission of Plasmodium knowlesi to humans 
      was published in 1965. In Southeast Asia, the atypical presentation of malaria
      cases, the changes in the distribution of the Plasmodium species diagnosed and
      their atypical morphology prompted several studies that confirmed natural
      infections in humans by this protozoon which naturally infects different species 
      of apes which are endemic in the forests of this region. Recent studies suggest
      that P. knowlesi malaria is not an emerging disease in humans but was rather
      being misdiagnosed due to its morphological similarity with P. malariae and P.
      falciparum, hampering its correct diagnosis by microscopic examination.
      Currently, the diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using P.
      knowlesi specific primers. Malaria by P. knowlesi has lead to fatal outcomes in
      humans and poses several challenges such as the development of useful diagnostic 
      tools for endemic areas, the study of the vectors involved and the therapeutic
      efficacy of the drugs for its treatment. In the jungle regions of South America
      it is imperative to monitor the parasites of simian malaria and the vectors that 
      have the potential to transmit this zoonosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study of the biological aspects of Anopheles spp., strengthens 
      the entomological surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To determine biological aspects and
      behavior of adult Anopheles mosquitoes in the urban area of Puerto Carreno
      municipality, Vichada, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild anophelines were
      collected landing on humans both indoors and outdoors between 18:00h and 06:00h
      for 50 min/h during two consecutive nights/month for eight months in the urban
      area of Puerto Carreno. The biting rate activity, the natural infection by
      Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax VK247 and VK210 using ELISA, and the annual
      entomological inoculation rate were determined for each species. The members of
      the Albitarsis complex were determined by amplificacion of the white gene by
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In order of abundance the species found were 
      An. darlingi (n=1,166), An. marajoara sensu stricto (n=152), An. braziliensis
      (n=59), An. albitarsis F (n=25), An. albitarsis sensu lato (n=16), An.
      argyritarsis (n=3) and An. oswaldoi sensu lato (n=2). An. darlingi showed two
      activity peaks between 21:00 to 22:00 and 05:00 to 06:00 hours outdoors and
      between 21:00 to 22:00 and 04:00 to 05:00 indoors. Natural infection of this
      species was found with P. vivax VK210 and its annual entomological inoculation
      rate was 2. Natural infection of An marajoara sensu stricto with P. falciparum
      was found, with an annual entomological inoculation rate of 5 and a peak biting
      activity between 18:00 to 19:00 hrs both indoors and outdoors. CONCLUSION:
      Transmission of malaria in the urban area of Puerto Carreno, Vichada, can occur
      by An. darlingi and An. marajoara s.s.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) method for
      quantitative detection and species identification of Plasmodium sporozoites in
      Anopheles mosquitoes. METHODS: One pair of human Plasmodium genus-specific
      primers based on 18S rRNA genes were used and the reaction system and reaction
      condition of FQ-PCR were optimized by using the mixture of Plasmodium 18S rRNA
      gene recombinant plasmids and Anopheles DNA as a template. The specificity was
      verified by using four Plasmodium spp. 18S rRNA gene plasmid DNA as well as
      mosquito DNA and the Plasmodium species was identified according to the value of 
      melting temperature (Tm). The standard curve was made by using P. vivax 18S rRNA 
      gene recombinant plasmids which were serially diluted by negative Anopheles DNA
      as a template. The sensitivity was analysed by using plasmid DNA and laboratory
      infected sporozoite positive mosquito DNA, respectively. The different parts and 
      different amounts of Anopheles DNA were added into the reaction system to
      investigate the influence of Anopheles DNA on the assessment. RESULTS: There was 
      no specific amplification for mosquito DNA and human blood DNA. There was
      specific amplification for Plasmodium 18S RNA gene recombinant plasmids and the
      Tm(s) of P. malariae, P. falciparum, P. ovale and P. vivax were 71.0, 72.7, 73.9 
      degrees C and 75.9 degrees C, respectively, which were easy to be identified. The
      standard curve indicated a good linear relationship between the cycle threshold
      (Ct) and template concentration (r = -0.99). The sensitivity was 50 copies of
      plasmid DNA or one sporozoite positive mosquito DNA diluted by 32 times of
      mosquito DNA. Anopheles DNA could inhibite the FQ-PCR reaction. The Ct value of
      amplification showed a good reproducibility both within the same experiment and
      among different experiments. CONCLUSION: The novel SYBR Green I based FQ-PCR
      method developed in this study shows a high sensitivity and specificity and it
      can be used for quantitative detection and species identification of sporozoites 
      in mosquitoes.

LID - 10.4137/BBI.S10193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the face of growing resistance in malaria parasites to drugs,
      pharmacological combination therapies are important. There is accumulating
      evidence that methylene blue (MB) is an effective drug against malaria. Here we
      explore the biological effects of both MB alone and in combination therapy using 
      modeling and experimental data. RESULTS: We built a model of the central
      metabolic pathways in P. falciparum. Metabolic flux modes and their changes under
      MB were calculated by integrating experimental data (RT-PCR data on mRNAs for
      redox enzymes) as constraints and results from the YANA software package for
      metabolic pathway calculations. Several different lines of MB attack on
      Plasmodium redox defense were identified by analysis of the network effects.
      Next, chloroquine resistance based on pfmdr/and pfcrt transporters, as well as
      pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine resistance (by mutations in DHF/DHPS), were modeled in 
      silico. Further modeling shows that MB has a favorable synergism on antimalarial 
      network effects with these commonly used antimalarial drugs. CONCLUSIONS:
      Theoretical and experimental results support that methylene blue should, because 
      of its resistance-breaking potential, be further tested as a key component in
      drug combination therapy efforts in holoendemic areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt treatment of malaria attacks with arteminisin-based
      combination therapy (ACT) is an essential tool for malaria control. A new
      co-blister tablet of artesunate-mefloquine (AM) with 25 mg/kg mefloquine has been
      developed for the management of uncomplicated malaria attacks. This
      non-inferiority randomized trial, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the new formulation of AM in comparison to artemether-lumefantrine (AL)
      for the treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults 
      in Senegal. METHODS: The study was carried out from September to December 2010 in
      two health centres in Senegal. The study end points included (i) PCR corrected
      adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28, (ii) ACPR at
      days 42 and 63, (iii) parasites and fever clearance time, (iv) incidence of
      adverse events and patients biological profile at day 7 using the WHO 2003
      protocol for anti-malarial drug evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, 310 patients were
      randomized to receive either AM (n = 157) or AL (n = 153). PCR corrected ACPR at 
      day 28 was at 95.5% in the AM arm while that in the AL arm was at 96.7% (p =
      0.83). Therapeutic efficacy was at 98.5% in the AM arm versus 98.2% in the AL
      group at day 42 (p = 1). At day 63, ACPR in the AM and AL arms was at 98.2% and
      97.7%, respectively (p = 0.32). The two treatments were well tolerated with
      similar biological profile at day 7. However, dizziness was more frequent in the 
      AM arm. CONCLUSION: Artesunate-mefloquine (25 mg/Kg mefloquine) is efficacious
      and well-tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in
      adult patients.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of malaria is an essential prerequisite for proper
      treatment and drug resistance monitoring. Microscopy is considered the gold
      standard for malaria diagnosis but has limitations. ELISA, PCR, and Real Time PCR
      are also used to diagnose malaria in reference laboratories, although their
      application at the field level is currently not feasible. Rapid diagnostic tests 
      (RDTs) however, have been brought into field operation and widely adopted in
      recent days. This study evaluates OnSite (Pf/Pan) antigen test, a new RDT
      introduced by CTK Biotech Inc, USA for malaria diagnosis in a reference setting. 
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from febrile patients referred for malaria 
      diagnosis by clinicians. Subjects were included in this study from two different 
      Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) situated in two malaria endemic districts of
      Bangladesh. Microscopy and nested PCR were considered the gold standard in this
      study. OnSite (Pf/Pan) RDT was performed on preserved whole blood samples.
      RESULTS: In total, 372 febrile subjects were included in this study. Of these
      subjects, 229 (61.6%) tested positive for Plasmodium infection detected by
      microscopy and nested PCR. OnSite (Pf/Pan) RDT was 94.2% sensitive (95% CI,
      89.3-97.3) and 99.5% specific (95% CI, 97.4-00.0) for Plasmodium falciparum
      diagnosis and 97.3% sensitive (95% CI, 90.5-99.7) and 98.7% specific (95% CI,
      96.6-99.6) for Plasmodium vivax diagnosis. Sensitivity varied with differential
      parasite count for both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The highest sensitivity was
      observed in febrile patients with parasitaemia that ranged from 501-1,000
      parasites/muL regardless of the Plasmodium species. CONCLUSION: The new OnSite
      (Pf/Pan) RDT is both sensitive and specific for symptomatic malaria diagnosis in 
      standard laboratory conditions.

TI  - Sporozoite neutralizing antibodies elicited in mice and rhesus macaques immunized

AB  - Antibodies that neutralize infectivity of malaria sporozoites target the central 
      repeat region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, which in Plasmodium
      falciparum is comprised primarily of 30-40 tandem NANP tetramer repeats. We
      evaluated immunogenicity of an alum-adsorbed (NANP)(6) peptide conjugated to an
      outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) derived from Neisseria meningitidis, a
      carrier protein used in a licensed Haemophilus influenzae pediatric vaccine. Mice
      immunized with (NANP)(6)-OMPC adsorbed to Merck's alum adjuvant (MAA), with or
      without Iscomatrix(R) as co-adjuvant, developed high levels of anti-repeat
      peptide antibody that inhibited in vitro invasion of human hepatoma cells by
      transgenic P. berghei sporozoites that express P. falciparum CS repeats (PfPb).
      Inhibition of sporozoite invasion in vitro correlated with in vivo resistance to 
      challenge by the bites of PfPb-infected mosquitoes. Challenged mice had >90%
      reduction of hepatic stage parasites as measured by real-time PCR, and either
      sterile immunity, i.e., no detectable blood stage parasites, or delayed prepatent
      periods which indicate neutralization of a majority, but not all, sporozoites.
      Rhesus macaques immunized with two doses of (NANP)(6)-OMPC/MAA formulated with
      Iscomatrix(R) developed anti-repeat antibodies that persisted for ~2 years. A
      third dose of (NANP)(6)-OMPC/MAA+ Iscomatrix(R) at that time elicited strong
      anamnestic antibody responses. Rhesus macaque immune sera obtained post second
      and third dose of vaccine displayed high levels of sporozoite neutralizing
      activity in vitro that correlated with presence of high anti-repeat antibody
      titers. These preclinical studies in mice of different MHC haplotypes and a
      non-human primate support use of CS peptide-OMPC conjugates as a highly
      immunogenic platform to evaluate CS protective epitopes. Potential
      pre-erythrocytic vaccines can be combined with sexual blood stage vaccines as a
      multi-antigen malaria vaccine to block invasion and transmission of Plasmodium
      parasites.

TI  - Comparison of asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infection in two malaria-endemic
      Colombian locations.
PG  - 129-36
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trs021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium spp. could help explain the
      dynamics of malaria transmission in low-transmission regions. We therefore
      compared the prevalence of asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium spp. in two
      Colombian locations, Tierralta and Tumaco, with different transmission patterns, 
      different ecological and epidemiological characteristics and potentially
      different associated factors. METHOD: Two cross-sectional studies were carried
      out between September 2006 and November 2007. Infection by Plasmodium spp. was
      determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy. RESULTS:
      Prevalence of asymptomatic infection at day 0 in Tierralta was 11.3% (95% CI
      7.2-16.8) by microscopy and 16.5% (95% CI 11.5-22.9) by PCR, while in Tumaco,
      values were 2.4% (95% CI 0.7-5.5) and 5.8% (95% CI 2.3-9.2) respectively. General
      prevalence of asymptomatic plasmodium infection after 28 days of follow-up was 5%
      (95% CI 3.2-7.7), 6.6% (95% CI 3.8-10.6%) in Tierralta and 3.4% (95% CI 1.5-6.6%)
      in Tumaco. Plasmodium vivax was predominant in Tierralta, P. falciparum in
      Tumaco. The main associated factors were male sex (aOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.0-6.7) and
      two to five previous malaria episodes (aOR 3.0; 95% CI 1.0-9.4). PCR detected 61%
      more infections than microscopy. CONCLUSION: Measurement of the prevalence of
      asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infection is suggested as part of the epidemiologic 
      evaluation of malaria in low-transmission areas such as Colombia.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in endemic countries: meta-analysis
      of randomised controlled studies.
PG  - 65-73
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trs019 [doi]
AB  - The present review aimed to synthesise available evidence on the efficacy of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in treating uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in people living in malaria-endemic countries by performing a 
      meta-analysis of relevant studies. We searched relevant studies in electronic
      data bases up to December 2011. Published results from randomised controlled
      trials (RCTs) comparing efficacy of DP with other artemisinin-based combination
      therapies (ACTs), or non-ACTs, or placebo were selected. The primary endpoint was
      28-day and 42-day treatment failure. We identified 26 RCTs. Many of the studies
      included in the present review were of high quality. Overall, DP,
      artesunate-mefloquine (MAS3) and artemether-lumefentrine (AL) were equally
      effective for reducing the risk of recurrent parasitaemia. The PCR confirmed
      efficacy of DP (99.5%) and MAS3 (97.7%) at day 28 exceeded 90%; both are
      efficacious. Comparable efficacy was also found for DP (95.6%) and AL (94.3%).
      The present review has documented that DP is comparable to other currently used
      ACTs such as MAS3 and AL in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The better
      safety profile of DP and once-daily dosage improves adherence and its fixed
      co-formulation ensures that both drugs are taken together. Our conclusion is that
      DP has the potential to become a first-line antimalarial drug.

      isolates collected from Uganda.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in mapping the genes of pathogens which underlie 
      important phenotypic traits such as virulence and drug resistance. The Plasmodium
      falciparum genome exhibits sequence variation that contributes to the pathogenic 
      mechanisms of the parasite. Determining the prevalence of resistance markers
      could provide a prediction about drug efficacy. Copy number polymorphism (CNP) of
      genes has been shown to influence important parasite phenotypes. In this work,
      CNPs within genes involved in drug resistance and other phenotypic traits namely 
      P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr-1), GTP cyclo hydrolase (gch1), Ring 
      infected erythrocyte surface antigen precursor (resa) and a hypothetical protein 
      coding gene were analyzed by quantitative real time-polymerase reaction (qRT-PCR)
      among clinical isolates collected from Uganda. The pfmdr-1 codons 86 and 1246 and
      P. falciparum chloroquine resistance (pfcrt) codon 76 were genotyped for single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and the proportion of resistance associated
      mutations were determined among mild and severe malaria cases using the
      chi-square test. Forty and 42 P. falciparum isolates collected from children with
      mild and severe malaria respectively were analyzed for CNPs. Seventy five and 81 
      P. falciparum isolates from children with mild or severe malaria were analyzed
      for SNPs. No pfmdr-1, gch1 or novel gene amplifications were identified among the
      P. falciparum clinical isolates. Although chloroquine was officially withdrawn
      from policy use since 7 years, all P. falciparum isolates presented the
      associated pfcrt K76T mutation, whatever the clinical status and no specific
      mutation in the pfmdr-1 gene was associated with disease type. In conclusion,
      this study provides baseline measures for continued surveillance for changes in
      copy number and SNP types among genes implicated in drug resistance and other
      important phenotypes that may have a potential role in parasite virulence
      mechanisms or drug treatment outcomes.

TI  - Reduction of multiplicity of infections but no change in msp2 genetic diversity
      in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Congolese children after introduction of
      artemisinin-combination therapy.
PG  - 410
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-410 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this first study conducted after the introduction of
      artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT), the major objective was to evaluate
      Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection in isolates
      from Congolese children between one and nine years of age enrolled and followed
      up for one year. The secondary objective was to characterize the msp2 profiles of
      P. falciparum isolates collected from successive malaria episodes in ten children
      who had four or more clinical episodes during the follow up. METHODS:
      Three-hundred and thirteen children residing in southern part of Brazzaville
      participated in this study. Blood samples were obtained from all children at
      enrollment and checked for P. falciparum infection. Based on the one year
      follow-up data, two clinical groups were considered according to the number of
      malaria episodes presented over the follow up period: "protected"(children who
      did not experience any episode) and "unprotected" (those who experienced more
      that two episodes). Therefore, the msp2 genetic diversity of P. falciparum
      isolates collected at enrollment in the two groups was characterized by
      allele-specific nested PCR and compared. The msp2 profiles of P. falciparum
      isolates collected from successive malaria episodes was also characterized by
      allele-specific nested PCR. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of FC27 and fifty-seven 
      percent of 3D7 in protected vs fifty-six percent of FC27 and forty-four percent
      of 3D7 in isolates from unprotected children were detected. Seven and two alleles
      belonging to the FC27, and six and three alleles belonging to 3D7 families were
      distinguished in isolates from protected and unprotected children respectively.
      The mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) values at inclusion for the msp2 locus
      was 1.29 and 1.43 for protected and unprotected children respectively. 43
      isolates were obtained from the ten children who had four or more clinical
      episodes during the follow up. A total of 63 alleles or fragments corresponding
      to 57% (36/63) FC27 and 43% (27/63) 3D7 were detected. The variant 400bp of FC27 
      was the most prevalent. 46% (20/43), 42% (18/43), 2% (1/43) and 2% (1/43) of
      isolates were found to have 1, 2, 3 and 4 parasite genotypes respectively and the
      mean MOI was 1.78. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the introduction of ACT in
      the Republic of Congo has reduced the MOI but not the genetic diversity of P.
      falciparum isolates from children living in Southern districts of Brazzaville.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A reliable and simple test for the detection of malaria parasite is
      crucial in providing effective treatment and therapeutic follow-up, especially in
      malaria elimination programmes. A comparison of four methods, including nested
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
      were used for the malaria diagnosis and treatment follow-up in Sao Tome and
      Principe, during a successful pre-elimination campaign. METHOD: During the period
      September to November 2009, blood samples from 128 children (five to 14 years
      old) with temperature >/=38 degrees C (tympanic) in the District of Agua Grande
      were examined using four different methods, i.e., histidine-rich protein 2
      (HRP-2) based rapid diagnostic tests (HRP-2-RDTs), optical microscopy, nested
      PCR, and LAMP. First-line treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine was given for
      uncomplicated malaria and intravenous quinine was given for complicated malaria. 
      Children with persistent positivity for malaria by microscopy, or either by
      nested PCR, or by LAMP on day 7 were given second-line treatment with
      artemether-lumefantrine. Treatment follow-up was made weekly, for up to four
      weeks. RESULTS: On day 0, positive results for HRP-2-RDTs, microscopy, nested
      PCR, and LAMP, were 68(53%), 47(37%), 64(50%), and 65(51%), respectively. When
      nested PCR was used as a reference standard, only LAMP was comparable; both
      HRP-2-RDTs and microscopy had moderate sensitivity; HRP-2-RDTs had poor positive 
      predictive value (PPV) and a moderate negative predictive value (NPV) for the
      treatment follow-up. Seventy-one children with uncomplicated malaria and eight
      children with complicated falciparum malaria were diagnosed based on at least one
      positive result from the four tests as well as clinical criteria. Twelve of the
      79 children receiving first-line treatment had positive results by nested PCR on 
      day 7 (nested PCR-corrected day 7 cure rate was 85%). After the second-line
      treatment, nested PCR/LAMP-corrected day 28 cure rate was 83% for these 12
      children. CONCLUSIONS: HRP-2-RDTs have similar sensitivity as microscopy but less
      specificity. However, as compared to nested PCR, the poor sensitivity of
      HRP-2-RDTs indicates that low parasitaemia may not be detected after treatment,
      as well as the low specificity of HRP-2-RDTs indicates it cannot be applied for
      treatment follow-up. LAMP has similar sensitivity and specificity to nested PCR. 
      With high PPV and NPV, LAMP is simpler and faster as compared to nested PCR with 
      the advantage of detecting low parasitaemia becoming a potential point-of-care
      test for treatment follow-up.

TI  - Epidemiology of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in north-east Sabah, Malaysia: family
      clusters and wide age distribution.
PG  - 401
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is a common cause of human
      malaria in Malaysian Borneo, with a particularly high incidence in Kudat, Sabah. 
      Little is known however about the epidemiology in this substantially deforested
      region. METHODS: Malaria microscopy records at Kudat District Hospital were
      retrospectively reviewed from January 2009-November 2011. Demographics, and PCR
      results if available, were recorded for each positive result. Medical records
      were reviewed for patients suspected of representing family clusters, and
      families contacted for further information. Rainfall data were obtained from the 
      Malaysian Meteorological Department. RESULTS: "Plasmodium malariae" mixed or
      mono-infection was diagnosed by microscopy in 517/653 (79%) patients. Of these,
      PCR was performed in 445 (86%) and was positive for P. knowlesi mono-infection in
      339 (76%). Patients with knowlesi malaria demonstrated a wide age distribution
      (median 33, IQR 20-50, range 0.7-89 years) with P. knowlesi predominating in all 
      age groups except those <5 years old, where numbers approximated those of
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Two contemporaneous family clusters
      were identified: a father with two children (aged 10-11 years); and three
      brothers (aged one-11 years), all with PCR-confirmed knowlesi malaria. Cases of
      P. knowlesi demonstrated significant seasonal variation, and correlated with
      rainfall in the preceding three to five months. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium knowlesi 
      is the most common cause of malaria admissions to Kudat District Hospital. The
      wide age distribution and presence of family clusters suggest that transmission
      may be occurring close to or inside people's homes, in contrast to previous
      reports from densely forested areas of Sarawak. These findings have significant
      implications for malaria control. Prospective studies of risk factors, vectors
      and transmission dynamics of P. knowlesi in Sabah, including potential for
      human-to-human transmission, are needed.

AB  - A 26-year-old woman with 29 weeks gestation presented with headache, photophobia 
      and fever. She had deranged liver function tests and low platelets on admission. 
      Blood film, performed to look for haemolysis, revealed she had Plasmodium vivax
      malaria, despite not having travelled to an endemic malaria area for over 1 year.
      The diagnosis was confirmed on PCR test performed in the HPA malaria reference
      laboratory in London and she was treated with chloroquine. She delivered a
      healthy baby at 33+3 weeks gestation, and once the patient and the baby had both 
      tested negative for glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase deficiency, she was given
      primaquine to clear the hypnozoite phase in the liver. This case highlights the
      importance of an extended travel history in a patient with fever of unknown
      origin and the difficulties of treating non-falciparum malaria in pregnancy.

      relevance for control.
PG  - 1237
LID - 10.1038/ncomms2241 [doi]
AB  - Malaria parasite prevalence in endemic populations is an essential indicator for 
      monitoring the progress of malaria control, and has traditionally been assessed
      by microscopy. However, surveys increasingly use sensitive molecular methods that
      detect higher numbers of infected individuals, questioning our understanding of
      the true infection burden and resources required to reduce it. Here we analyse a 
      series of data sets to characterize the distribution and epidemiological factors 
      associated with low-density, submicroscopic infections. We show that
      submicroscopic parasite carriage is common in adults, in low-endemic settings and
      in chronic infections. We find a strong, non-linear relationship between
      microscopy and PCR prevalence in population surveys (n=106), and provide a tool
      to relate these measures. When transmission reaches very low levels,
      submicroscopic carriers are estimated to be the source of 20-50% of all
      human-to-mosquito transmissions. Our findings challenge the idea that individuals
      with little previous malaria exposure have insufficient immunity to control
      parasitaemia and suggest a role for molecular screening.

TI  - Efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Cambodia, 2008 to 2010.
PG  - 818-26
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00686-12 [doi]
AB  - We describe here the results of antimalarial therapeutic efficacy studies
      conducted in Cambodia from 2008 to 2010. A total of 15 studies in four sentinel
      sites were conducted using dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) for the treatment 
      of Plasmodium falciparum infection and chloroquine (CQ) and DP for the treatment 
      of P. vivax infection. All studies were performed according to the standard World
      Health Organization protocol for the assessment of antimalarial treatment
      efficacy. Among the studies of DP for the treatment of P. falciparum, an increase
      in treatment failure was observed in the western provinces. In 2010, the
      PCR-corrected treatment failure rates for DP on day 42 were 25% (95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 10 to 51%) in Pailin and 10.7% (95% CI = 4 to 23%) in Pursat,
      while the therapeutic efficacy of DP remained high (100%) in Ratanakiri and Preah
      Vihear provinces, located in northern and eastern Cambodia. For the studies of P.
      vivax, the day 28 uncorrected treatment failure rate among patients treated with 
      CQ ranged from 4.4 to 17.4%; DP remained 100% effective in all sites. Further
      study is required to investigate suspected P. falciparum resistance to
      piperaquine in western Cambodia; the results of in vitro and molecular studies
      were not found to support the therapeutic efficacy findings. The emergence of
      artemisinin resistance in this region has likely put additional pressure on
      piperaquine. Although DP appears to be an appropriate new first-line treatment
      for P. vivax in Cambodia, alternative treatments are urgently needed for P.
      falciparum-infected patients in western Cambodia.

TI  - Diagnosing malaria in pregnancy: an update.
PG  - 1177-87
LID - 10.1586/eri.12.98 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy malaria (PM) due to Plasmodium falciparum is a major cause of morbidity
      and mortality for women and their offspring, but is difficult to recognize and
      diagnose. During PM, parasites typically sequester in the placenta, whereas
      peripheral blood smears often appear negative. In addition, many infected women
      remain asymptomatic, especially in areas of high transmission where systemic
      immunity is high, although sequelae including maternal anemia and intrauterine
      growth retardation develop insidiously and increase mortality. New rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) have shown promise for malaria diagnosis in nonpregnant
      individuals, including a product recently approved by the US FDA for use in the
      USA. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for diagnosis of PM may be 
      suboptimal. Here, we review the methods that are used to detect or diagnose PM,
      including blood smear microscopy, RDTs, PCR-based methods, and finally placental 
      histology, which is often cited as the gold standard for use in research studies 
      and clinical trials.

AB  - In the context of an Intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) trial for pregnant 
      women in Malawi, Plasmodium falciparum samples from 85 women at enrollment and 35
      women at delivery were genotyped for mutations associated with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. The prevalence of the highly resistant
      haplotype with mutations at codons 51 and 108 of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr)
      and codons 437 and 540 of dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) increased from 81% at
      enrollment to 100% at delivery (P = 0.01). Pregnant women who were smear-positive
      at enrollment were more likely to have P. falciparum parasitemia at delivery.
      These results lend support to concerns that IPTp use may lead to increased drug
      resistance in pregnant women during pregnancy and emphasise the importance of
      screening pregnant women for malaria parasites in areas with prevalent SP
      resistance even when they are already on IPTp.

AB  - Plasmodium vivax is a common cause of imported malaria in the USA, second only to
      P. falciparum. We present a case of P. vivax malaria in a child returning from
      India. P. vivax was initially diagnosed by standard methodology and detected
      retrospectively by use of broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass
      spectrometry using a panel of primers designed to detect vector-borne pathogens. 
      This is the first reported case of P. vivax detection using PCR and electrospray 
      ionization mass spectrometry.

      artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 43-7
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0364 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the primary drugs used for treatment of
      malaria has become the main obstacle to malaria control. Artemisinin combination 
      therapies are the current treatment strategy, and it has been suggested that
      resistance to artemisinin derivatives may be related to mutations in the
      Plasmodium falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase ortholog
      of the mammalian sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase gene, known as the
      pfatp6 gene. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfatp6. The presence of different SNPs 
      was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the pfatp6 gene, and
      then sequencing to identify all possible alleles of the gene. A total of 20 SNPs 
      were detected, including eight SNPs that have not been previously described:
      K481R in Malabo; R801H on Annobon Island; and the synonymous SNPs a141t, c1788t, 
      a2211g, t2739g, a2760c, and g2836a. The genotypic profile of pfatp6 in samples
      from Equatorial Guinea, may be a useful epidemiologic tool for monitoring local
      efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies.

TI  - Anopheles plumbeus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Europe: a mere nuisance mosquito or
      potential malaria vector?
PG  - 393
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles plumbeus has been recognized as a minor vector for human
      malaria in Europe since the beginning of the 20th century. In recent years this
      tree hole breeding mosquito species appears to have exploited novel breeding
      sites, including large and organically rich man-made containers, with
      consequently larger mosquito populations in close vicinity to humans. This lead
      to investigate whether current populations of An. plumbeus would be able to
      efficiently transmit Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most
      deadly form of malaria. METHODS: Anopheles plumbeus immatures were collected from
      a liquid manure pit in Switzerland and transferred as adults to the CEPIA
      (Institut Pasteur, France) where they were fed on P. falciparum gametocytes
      produced in vitro. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes served as controls. Development
      of P. falciparum in both mosquito species was followed by microscopical detection
      of oocysts on mosquito midguts and by sporozoite detection in the head/thorax by 
      PCR and microscopy. RESULTS: A total of 293 wild An. plumbeus females from four
      independent collections successfully fed through a membrane on blood containing
      P. falciparum gametocytes. Oocysts were observed in mosquito midguts and P.
      falciparum DNA was detected in head-thorax samples in all four experiments,
      demonstrating, on a large mosquito sample, that An. plumbeus is indeed receptive 
      to P. falciparum NF54 and able to produce sporozoites. Importantly, the
      proportion of sporozoites-infected An. plumbeus was almost similar to that of An.
      gambiae (31 to 88% An. plumbeus versus 67 to 97% An. gambiae). However, the
      number of sporozoites produced was significantly lower in infected An. plumbeus. 
      CONCLUSION: The results show that a sample of field-caught An. plumbeus has a
      moderate to high receptivity towards P. falciparum. Considering the increased
      mobility of humans between Europe and malaria endemic countries and changes in
      environment and climate, these data strongly suggest that An. plumbeus could act 
      as a vector for malaria and thus significantly contribute to increasing the
      malaria transmission risk in Central-Western Europe. In locations showing high
      vulnerability to the presence of gametocyte carriers, the risk of transmission of
      malaria by An. plumbeus should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Placental malaria is the predominant pathology secondary to malaria
      in pregnancy, causing substantial maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in 
      tropical areas. While it is clear that placental parasites are phenotypically
      different from those in the peripheral circulation, it is not known whether
      unique genotypes are associated specifically with placental infection or perhaps 
      more generally with pregnancy. In this study, genetic analysis was performed on
      Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum parasites isolated from peripheral and
      placental blood in pregnant women living in North-west Colombia, and compared
      with parasites causing acute malaria in non-pregnant populations. METHODS: A
      total of 57 pregnant women at delivery with malaria infection confirmed by
      real-time PCR in peripheral or placental blood were included, as well as 50
      pregnant women in antenatal care and 80 men or non-pregnant women with acute
      malaria confirmed by a positive thick smear for P. vivax or P. falciparum. Five
      molecular markers per species were genotyped by nested PCR and capillary
      electrophoresis. Genetic diversity and the fixation index FST per species and
      study group were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Almost all infections at
      delivery were asymptomatic with significantly lower levels of infection compared 
      with the groups with acute malaria. Expected heterozygosity for P. vivax
      molecular markers ranged from 0.765 to 0.928 and for P. falciparum markers ranged
      from 0.331 to 0.604. For P. vivax infections, the genetic diversity was similar
      amongst the four study groups and the fixation index from each pairwise
      comparison failed to show significant genetic differentiation. For P. falciparum,
      no genetic differentiation was observed between placental and peripheral
      parasites from the same woman at delivery, but the parasites isolated at delivery
      showed significant genetic differentiation compared with parasites isolated from 
      subjects with acute malaria. CONCLUSIONS: In North-west Colombia, P. vivax
      parasites have high genetic diversity that is equivalent in pregnant and
      non-pregnant populations as well as in symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.
      For P. falciparum, the overall genetic diversity is lower, with specific
      genotypes associated with asymptomatic infections at delivery.

AB  - Malaria parasites like other aerobes need to detoxify the reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) that are mainly produced from hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole.
      Since Plasmodium lacks catalase and genuine glutathione peroxidase, they are
      highly dependent on peroxiredoxins (Prxs) and superoxide dismutases for ROS
      detoxification. Prxs are protective antioxidant enzymes that act through
      reduction of hydrogen peroxides. In recent years, several studies have been done 
      on Prx family of human malaria parasites mainly on Plasmodium falciparum but not 
      much on the other human malaria species. In this study 1-Cys peroxiredoxin
      (1-Cys-Prx) from Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi were cloned and
      characterized. The complete genes coding for 1-Cys-Prx of P. vivax (Pv1-Cys-Prx) 
      and P. knowlesi (Pk1-Cys-Prx) were PCR amplified and the recombinant proteins
      were produced by heterologous over-expression in Escherichia coli. Both
      recombinant proteins showed antioxidant activity with the mixed function
      oxidation assay. Using specific polyclonal antibodies, it was indicated that
      Pv1-Cys-Prx and Pk1-Cys-Prx are expressed in the cytoplasm of the parasite.
      Altogether, the results suggested that 1-Cys-Prxs protect the parasites from
      oxidative damages.

TI  - The effect of primaquine on gametocyte development and clearance in the treatment
      of uncomplicated falciparum malaria with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in South 
      sumatra, Western indonesia: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 685-93
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis959 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is very effective in clearing
      asexual stages of malaria and reduces gametocytemia, but may not affect mature
      gametocytes. Primaquine is the only commercially available drug that eliminates
      mature gametocytes. METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm, open-label, randomized,
      controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of single-dose primaquine (0.75 mg/kg) 
      following treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) on Plasmodium
      falciparum gametocytemia, in Indonesia. Patients aged >/=5 years with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria, normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme
      levels, and hemoglobin levels >/=8 g/dL were assigned by computerized-generating 
      sequence to a standard 3-day course of DHP alone (n = 178) or DHP combined with a
      single dose of primaquine on day 3 (n = 171). Patients were seen on days 1, 2, 3,
      and 7 and then weekly for 42 days to assess the presence of gametocytes and
      asexual parasites by microscopy. Survival analysis was stratified by the presence
      of gametocytes on day 3. RESULTS: DHP prevented development of gametocytes in 277
      patients without gametocytes on day 3. In the gametocytemic patients (n = 72),
      primaquine was associated with faster gametocyte clearance (hazard ratio = 2.42
      [95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.19], P = .002) and reduced gametocyte densities 
      (P = .018). The day 42 cure rate of asexual stages in the DHP + primaquine and
      DHP-only arms were: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) unadjusted, 98.7% vs 99.4%,
      respectively; PCR adjusted, 100% for both. Primaquine was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Addition of single-dose 0.75 mg/kg primaquine shortens the
      infectivity period of DHP-treated patients and should be considered in
      low-transmission regions that aim to control and ultimately eliminate falciparum 
      malaria. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01392014.

      distinct localization.
PG  - 387
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a pyridoxal
      phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays a vital role in the de novo pyrimidine
      biosynthesis pathway in malaria parasites. Two genes have been identified in
      Plasmodium spp. encoding a cytosolic SHMT (cSHMT) and putative mitochondria SHMT 
      (mSHMT), but their roles have not been fully investigated. METHODS: The presence 
      of Plasmodium SHMT isoforms in the intra-erythrocytic stage was assessed based on
      their gene expression using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Localization
      studies of Plasmodium SHMT isoforms were performed by transfection of
      fluorescent-tagged gene constructs into P. falciparum and expressions of
      fluorescent fusion proteins in parasites were observed using a laser scanning
      confocal microscope. Genetic targeting through homologous recombination was used 
      to study the essentiality of SHMT in Plasmodium spp. RESULTS: Semi-quantitative
      RT-PCR revealed the expression of these two genes throughout intra-erythrocytic
      development. Localization studies using P. falciparum expressing
      fluorescent-tagged SHMT showed that PfcSHMT-red fluorescent fusion protein
      (PfcSHMT-DsRed) is localized in the cytoplasm, while PfmSHMT-green fluorescent
      fusion protein (PfmSHMT-GFP) co-localized with Mitotracker-labelled mitochondria 
      as predicted. The essentiality of plasmodial cSHMT was inferred from transfection
      experiments where recovery of viable knock-out parasites was not achieved, unless
      complemented with a functional equivalent copy of shmt. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct
      compartment localizations of PfSHMT were observed between cytoplasmic and
      mitochondrial isoforms, and evidence was provided for the indispensable role of
      plasmodial cSHMT indicating it as a valid target for development of novel
      anti-malarials.

TI  - Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum using antigenic polymorphic markers and to
      study anti-malarial drug resistance markers in malaria endemic areas of
      Bangladesh.
PG  - 386
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past many regions of Bangladesh were hyperendemic for malaria.
      Malaria control in the 1960s to 1970s eliminated malaria from the plains but in
      the Chittagong Hill Tracts remained a difficult to control reservoir. The
      Chittagong Hill Tracts have areas with between 1 and 10% annual malaria rates,
      predominately 90-95% Plasmodium falciparum. In Southeast Asia, multiplicity of
      infection for hypo-endemic regions has been approximately 1.5. Few studies on the
      genetic diversity of P. falciparum have been performed in Bangladesh. Anderson et
      al. performed a study in Khagrachari, northern Chittagong Hill Tracts in 2002 on 
      203 patients and found that parasites had a multiplicity of infection of 1.3 by
      MSP-1, MSP-2 and GLURP genotyping. A total of 94% of the isolates had the K76T
      Pfcrt chloroquine resistant genotype, and 70% showed the N86Y Pfmdr1 genotype.
      Antifolate drug resistant genotypes were high with 99% and 73% of parasites
      having two or more mutations at the dhfr or dhps loci. METHODS: Nested and
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to genotype P.
      falciparum using antigenic polymorphic markers and to study anti-malarial drug
      resistance markers in malaria endemic areas of Bangladesh. RESULTS: The analysis 
      of polymorphic and drug resistant genotype on 33 paired recrudescent infections
      after drug treatment in the period 2004 to 2008 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,
      which is just prior to countrywide provision of artemisinin combination therapy. 
      Overall the multiplicity of infection for MSP-1 was 2.7 with a slightly smaller
      parasite diversity post-treatment. The 13 monoclonal infections by both GLURP and
      MSP-1 were evenly divided between pre- and post-treatment. The MSP-1 MAD block
      was most frequent in 66 of the samples. The prevalence of the K76T PfCRT
      chloroquine resistant allele was approximately 82% of the samples, while the
      resistant Pfmdr1 N86Y was present in 33% of the samples. Interestingly, the
      post-treatment samples had a small but significantly higher frequency of the
      sensitive PfCRT alleles by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: The parasite population retains
      high population diversity despite hypo-endemic transmission with retention, but
      decrease in the chloroquine-resistant allele and Pfmdr1 resistant alleles in the 
      Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh.

TI  - Entomological indices of malaria transmission in Chikhwawa district, Southern
      Malawi.
PG  - 380
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although malaria is highly prevalent throughout Malawi, little is
      known of its transmission dynamics. This paper describes the seasonal activity of
      the different vectors, human biting indices, sporozoite rates and the
      entomological inoculation rate in a low-lying rural area in southern Malawi.
      METHODS: Vectors were sampled over 52 weeks from January 2002 to January 2003, by
      pyrethrum knockdown catch in two villages in Chikhwawa district, in the Lower
      Shire Valley. RESULTS: In total, 7,717 anophelines were collected of which 55.1% 
      were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and 44.9% were Anopheles funestus. Three
      members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR: Anopheles arabiensis
      (75%) was abundant throughout the year, An. gambiae s.s. (25%) was most common
      during the wet season and Anopheles quadriannulatus occurred at a very low
      frequency (n=16). An. funestus was found in all samples but was most common
      during the dry season.Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. funestus were highly
      anthropophilic with human blood indices of 99.2% and 96.3%, respectively.
      Anopheles arabiensis had fed predominantly on humans (85.0%) and less commonly on
      cattle (10.9%; 1.2% of blood meals were of mixed origin). Plasmodium falciparum
      (192/3,984) and Plasmodium malariae (1/3,984) sporozoites were detected by PCR in
      An. arabiensis (3.2%) and An. funestus (4.5%), and in a significantly higher
      proportion of An. gambiae s.s. (10.6%)(p<0.01). All three vectors were present
      throughout the year and malaria transmission occurred in every month, although
      with greatest intensity during the rainy season (January to April). The combined 
      human blood index exceeded 92% and the P. falciparum sporozoite rate was 4.8%,
      resulting in estimated inoculation rates of 183 infective bites/ person per
      annum, or an average rate of ~15 infective bites/person/month. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results demonstrate the importance of An. gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis and An.
      funestus in driving the high levels of malaria transmission in the south of
      Malawi. Sustained and high coverage or roll out of current approaches to malaria 
      control (primarily insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual house
      spraying) in the area are likely to reduce the observed high malaria transmission
      rate and consequently the incidence of human infections, unless impeded by
      increasing resistance of vectors to insecticides.

      clinical Plasmodium falciparum isolates during erythrocyte schizogony.
PG  - e49540
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0049540 [doi]
AB  - Avoidance of antibody-mediated immune recognition allows parasites to establish
      chronic infections and enhances opportunities for transmission. The human malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses a number of multi-copy gene families,
      including var, rif, stevor and pfmc-2tm, which encode variant antigens believed
      to be expressed on the surfaces of infected erythrocytes. However, most studies
      of these antigens are based on in vitro analyses of culture-adapted isolates,
      most commonly the laboratory strain 3D7, and thus may not be representative of
      the unique challenges encountered by P. falciparum in the human host. To
      investigate the expression of the var, rif-A, rif-B, stevor and pfmc-2tm family
      genes under conditions that mimic more closely the natural course of infection,
      ex vivo clinical P. falciparum isolates were analyzed using a novel quantitative 
      real-time PCR approach. Expression patterns in the clinical isolates at various
      time points during the first intraerythrocytic developmental cycle in vitro were 
      compared to those of strain 3D7. In the clinical isolates, in contrast to strain 
      3D7, there was a peak of expression of the multi-copy gene families rif-A, stevor
      and pfmc-2tm at the young ring stage, in addition to the already known expression
      peak in trophozoites. Furthermore, most of the variant surface antigen families
      were overexpressed in the clinical isolates relative to 3D7, with the exception
      of the pfmc-2tm family, expression of which was higher in 3D7 parasites.
      Immunofluorescence analyses performed in parallel revealed two stage-dependent
      localization patterns of RIFIN, STEVOR and PfMC-2TM. Proteins were exported into 
      the infected erythrocyte at the young trophozoite stage, whereas they remained
      inside the parasite membrane during schizont stage and were subsequently observed
      in different compartments in the merozoite. These results reveal a complex
      pattern of expression of P. falciparum multi-copy gene families during clinical
      progression and are suggestive of diverse functional roles of the respective
      proteins.

AB  - The impact of malaria intervention measures (insecticide-treated net use and
      artemisinin combination therapy) on malaria genetics was investigated at two
      sites in western Kenya: an endemic lowland and an epidemic highland. The genetic 
      structure of the parasite population was assessed by using microsatellites, and
      the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations was examined by using the polymerase
      chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Two years after
      intervention, genetic diversity remained high in both populations. A significant 
      decrease in the prevalence of quintuple mutations conferring resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was detected in both populations, but the mutation
      prevalence at codon 1246 of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene
      had increased in the highland population. The decrease in
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant mutants is encouraging, but the increase in
      P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene mutations is worrisome because these
      mutations are linked to resistance to other antimalarial drugs. In addition, the 
      high level of genetic diversity observed after intervention suggests transmission
      is still high in each population.

TI  - Quinine treatment selects the pfnhe-1 ms4760-1 polymorphism in Malian patients
      with Falciparum malaria.
PG  - 520-7
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to quinine is not
      known. In vitro quantitative trait loci mapping suggests involvement of a
      predicted P. falciparum sodium-hydrogen exchanger (pfnhe-1) on chromosome 13.
      METHODS: We conducted prospective quinine efficacy studies in 2 villages, Kolle
      and Faladie, Mali. Cases of clinical malaria requiring intravenous therapy were
      treated with standard doses of quinine and followed for 28 days. Treatment
      outcomes were classified using modified World Health Organization protocols.
      Molecular markers of parasite polymorphisms were used to distinguish recrudescent
      parasites from new infections. The prevalence of pfnhe-1 ms4760-1 among parasites
      before versus after quinine treatment was determined by direct sequencing.
      RESULTS: Overall, 163 patients were enrolled and successfully followed. Without
      molecular correction, the mean adequate clinical and parasitological response
      (ACPR) was 50.3% (n = 163). After polymerase chain reaction correction to account
      for new infections, the corrected ACPR was 100%. The prevalence of ms4760-1
      increased significantly, from 26.2% (n = 107) before quinine treatment to 46.3%
      (n = 54) after therapy (P = .01). In a control sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine study,
      the prevalence of ms4760-1 was similar before and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study supports a role for pfnhe-1 in decreased susceptibility of P.
      falciparum to quinine in the field.

      in returning travellers and migrants: a retrospective study.
PG  - 377
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (RDTs) allow accurate diagnosis
      and prompt treatment. Validation of their usefulness in travellers with fever was
      needed. The safety of a strategy to diagnose falciparum malaria based on RDT
      followed by immediate or delayed microscopy reading at first attendance was
      evaluated in one referral hospital in Switzerland. METHODS: A retrospective study
      was conducted in the outpatient clinic and emergency ward of University Hospital,
      covering a period of eight years (1999-2007). The study was conducted in the
      outpatient clinic and emergency ward of University Hospital. All adults suspected
      of malaria with a diagnostic test performed were included. RDT and microscopy as 
      immediate tests were performed during working hours, and RDT as immediate test
      and delayed microscopy reading out of laboratory working hours. The main outcome 
      measure was occurrence of specific complications in RDT negative and RDT positive
      adults. RESULTS: 2,139 patients were recruited. 1987 had both initial RDT and
      blood smear (BS) result negative. Among those, 2/1987 (0.1%) developed
      uncomplicated malaria with both RDT and BS positive on day 1 and day 6
      respectively. Among the 152 patients initially malaria positive, 137 had both RDT
      and BS positive, four only BS positive and five only RDT positive (PCR confirmed)
      (six had only one test performed). None of the four initially RDT negative/BS
      positive and none of the five initially BS negative/RDT positive developed severe
      malaria while 6/137 of both RDT and BS positive did so. The use of RDT allowed a 
      reduction of a median of 2.1 hours to get a first malaria test result.
      CONCLUSIONS: A malaria diagnostic strategy based on RDTs and a delayed BS is safe
      in non-immune populations, and shortens the time to first malaria test result.

TI  - In vitro antimalarial susceptibility and molecular markers of drug resistance in 
      Franceville, Gabon.
PG  - 307
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem, due largely to
      emergence and widespread P. falciparum drug resistance. WHO recommends
      artemisinine combination based therapy (ACT) to overcome P. falciparum drug
      resistance, but reports of declining ACT efficacy have been published. A thorough
      understanding of the molecular bases of P. falciparum resistance to existing
      drugs is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to analyze the in vitro
      sensitivity of P. falciparum field isolates from Franceville, Gabon, to
      chloroquine (CQ), mefloquine (MF), dihydroartemisinine (DHA) and
      monodesethylamodiaquine (MDAQ), and to investigate polymorphisms associated with 
      drug resistance. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 53 field
      isolates. Field isolates sensitivity to CQ, MF, DHA and MDAQ was assessed using
      the colorimetric DELI test. The Pfmdr1 codons 86 and 1246, Pfcrt (haplotype codon
      72 to 76) and the PfATPAse6 codons 110 and 2694 were analysed by PCR-RFLP.
      Associations between drug sensitivity and parasite gene polymorphisms were
      evaluated with the Chi square test, and routine hematological parameters were
      analyzed with Fisher's exact test implemented with Epinfo software. In all
      statistical tests, significance was assumed at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 46 P. 
      falciparum isolates were successfully cultured in vitro and their sensitivity was
      tested. The proportions of isolates resistant to CQ, MF and MDAQ were 43.5%,
      23.4% and 56.5%, respectively. Some isolates (23.9%) had DHA IC50 values higher
      than 10 nM. The median IC50 values were 71.67 (interquartile range (IQR,
      1-438.2), 6.59 (IQR, 0.08-96), 64.79 (IQR, 0.09-448) and 6.45 nM (IQR, 0.09-23)
      for CQ, MF, MDAQ and DHA, respectively. The strongest correlation between
      diminished DHA sensitivity and MF resistance was observed (r2=0.73), followed by 
      correlation between diminished DHA sensitivity and CQ resistance.
      Cross-resistance between CQ and MF was also observed. The prevalence of the 86Y
      and 1246Y mutations in Pfmdr1, 76T in Pfcrt, and 110A and 2694T in PfATPase6 was 
      respectively 42% and 17.1%, 97.8%, and 0% and 22.2%. CONCLUSION: These high
      levels of antimalarial drug resistance in Franceville, Gabon, call for reinforced
      surveillance of drug efficacy.

AB  - Controlled human malaria infection with sporozoites is a standardized and
      powerful tool for evaluation of malaria vaccine and drug efficacy but so far only
      applied by exposure to bites of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-infected mosquitoes.
      We assessed in an open label Phase 1 trial, infection after intradermal injection
      of respectively 2,500, 10,000, or 25,000 aseptic, purified, vialed, cryopreserved
      Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ) in three groups (N = 6/group) of healthy Dutch volunteers.
      Infection was safe and parasitemia developed in 15 of 18 volunteers (84%), 5 of 6
      volunteers in each group. There were no differences between groups in time until 
      parasitemia by microscopy or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, parasite
      kinetics, clinical symptoms, or laboratory values. This is the first successful
      infection by needle and syringe with PfSPZ manufactured in compliance with
      regulatory standards. After further optimization, the use of such PfSPZ may
      facilitate and accelerate clinical development of novel malaria drugs and
      vaccines.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology of malaria in Taiwan
      between 2002 and 2010. We analyzed data reported as part of surveillance programs
      run by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC). Malaria cases were
      diagnosed by blood films, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests.
      The risk of re-establishment of malaria transmission in Taiwan was assessed. A
      total of 193 malaria cases were included in our analysis. All of the cases were
      associated with importation. One hundred and fifty-eight cases (82%) were
      diagnosed within 13 days from the start of symptoms/signs, and 44% of these cases
      were acquired in Africa and 42% were acquired in Asia. Plasmodium falciparum was 
      responsible for the majority (49%) of these cases. Travel to an endemic area was 
      associated with the acquisition of malaria. The malaria importation rate was 2.77
      per 1,000,000 travelers (range, 1.35-5.74). The reproductive number under control
      (R(c)) was 0. No endemic transmission of malaria in Taiwan was identified. This
      study suggests that maintaining a vigilant surveillance system, environmental
      management, vector-control efforts, and case management are needed to prevent
      outbreaks and sustain the eradication of malaria in Taiwan.

TI  - Rapid antigen detection tests for malaria diagnosis in severely ill Papua New
      Guinean children: a comparative study using Bayesian latent class models.
PG  - e48701
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048701 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have practical advantages over
      light microscopy (LM) and good sensitivity in severe falciparum malaria in
      Africa, their utility where severe non-falciparum malaria occurs is unknown. LM, 
      RDTs and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have limitations, and thus
      conventional comparative malaria diagnostic studies employ imperfect gold
      standards. We assessed whether, using Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) which
      do not require a reference method, RDTs could safely direct initial
      anti-infective therapy in severe ill children from an area of hyperendemic
      transmission of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      studied 797 Papua New Guinean children hospitalized with well-characterized
      severe illness for whom LM, RDT and nested PCR (nPCR) results were available. For
      any severe malaria, the estimated prevalence was 47.5% with RDTs exhibiting
      similar sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) to nPCR (>/=96.0%). LM
      was the least sensitive test (87.4%) and had the lowest NPV (89.7%), but had the 
      highest specificity (99.1%) and positive predictive value (98.9%). For severe
      falciparum malaria (prevalence 42.9%), the findings were similar. For
      non-falciparum severe malaria (prevalence 6.9%), no test had the WHO-recommended 
      sensitivity and specificity of >95% and >90%, respectively. RDTs were the least
      sensitive (69.6%) and had the lowest NPV (96.7%). CONCLUSIONS: RDTs appear a
      valuable point-of-care test that is at least equivalent to LM in diagnosing
      severe falciparum malaria in this epidemiologic situation. None of the tests had 
      the required sensitivity/specificity for severe non-falciparum malaria but the
      number of false-negative RDTs in this group was small.

TI  - Candidate human genetic polymorphisms and severe malaria in a Tanzanian
      population.
PG  - e47463
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047463 [doi]
AB  - Human genetic background strongly influences susceptibility to malaria infection 
      and progression to severe disease and death. Classical genetic studies identified
      haemoglobinopathies and erythrocyte-associated polymorphisms, as protective
      against severe disease. High throughput genotyping by mass spectrometry allows
      multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be examined simultaneously. We
      compared the prevalence of 65 human SNP's, previously associated with altered
      risk of malaria, between Tanzanian children with and without severe malaria. Five
      hundred children, aged 1-10 years, with severe malaria were recruited from those 
      admitted to hospital in Muheza, Tanzania and compared with matched controls.
      Genotyping was performed by Sequenom MassArray, and conventional PCR was used to 
      detect deletions in the alpha-thalassaemia gene. SNPs in two X-linked genes were 
      associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females but not in males:
      heterozygosity for one or other of two SNPs in the G6PD gene was associated with 
      protection from all forms of severe disease whilst two SNPs in the gene encoding 
      CD40L were associated with respiratory distress. A SNP in the adenyl cyclase 9
      (ADCY9) gene was associated with protection from acidosis whilst a polymorphism
      in the IL-1alpha gene (IL1A) was associated with an increased risk of acidosis.
      SNPs in the genes encoding IL-13 and reticulon-3 (RTN3) were associated with
      increased risk of cerebral malaria. This study confirms previously known genetic 
      associations with protection from severe malaria (HbS, G6PD). It identifies two
      X-linked genes associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females,
      identifies mutations in ADCY9, IL1A and CD40L as being associated with altered
      risk of severe respiratory distress and acidosis, both of which are characterised
      by high serum lactate levels, and also identifies novel genetic associations with
      severe malaria (TRIM5) and cerebral malaria(IL-13 and RTN3). Further studies are 
      required to test the generality of these associations and to understand their
      functional consequences.

TI  - Molecular assessment of atpase6 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance 
      among unexposed and exposed Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates to
      artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 373
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the mainstay of global
      efforts for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but decline in its
      efficacy is the most important obstacle towards malaria control and elimination. 
      Therefore, the present molecular analysis provides information on putative
      mutations associated with artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum clinical
      population unexposed and exposed to artesunate 4 years after adoption of ACT as
      the first-line anti-malarial therapy in Iran. METHODS: In this study, blood
      samples (n = 226) were collected from uncomplicated P. falciparum-infected
      patients from different health centers of Chabahar district in Sistan and
      Baluchistan province in the south-eastern part of Iran, during 2003 to 2010. All 
      collected isolates were analysed for putative candidate mutations (TTA) L263E
      (GAA), (GAA) E431K (AAA), (GCA) A623E (GAA) and (AGT) S769N (AAT) of pfatpase6
      gene using nested PCR/RFLP, followed by sequencing. Furthermore, the gene copy
      number was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in the presence of
      SYBR green. RESULTS: Neither the pfatpase6 L263E nor the A623E mutation was
      detected among all examined isolates. The E431K mutation was found in 23% of the 
      analysed samples unexposed to ACT; however, it was detected in 17.8% (34/191) of 
      P. falciparum isolates exposed to artesunate after 2007. High frequency of this
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (overall 18.6%) among both examined groups 
      (X2 test, P>0.05) indicated that this SNP should be considered as an unrelated
      mutation to artemisinin resistance. In contrast, S769N mutation was not detected 
      in unexposed isolates; however, it was found in 2.6% (5/191), four years after
      introduction of ACT in this malaria setting. Also, detected SNPs were not
      significantly frequent in both unexposed and exposed examined isolates (X2 test, 
      P> 0.05). Investigation in the copy number of pfatpase6 gene revealed a similar
      number of copy (n = 1) as in an isolate sensitive to artemisinin. CONCLUSION:
      Taken together, the results suggest, in particular, that pfatpase6 S769N gene
      needs more consideration for its possible association with artesunate resistance 
      among P. falciparum isolates.

TI  - Absence of asymptomatic malaria infection in endemic area of bashagard district, 
      hormozgan province, iran.
PG  - 36-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: A successful malaria elimination program calls for enough attention
      to parasite carriers, especially asymptomatic malaria, as well as the diagnosis
      and treatment of clinical cases. Asymptomatic malaria is an infection that
      patients do not show any symptom; thus, these patients play critical role in the 
      concept of an elimination program. The current investigation was conducted to
      evaluate the presence of these cases in Bashagard District, formerly a high
      malaria transmission area in Hormozgan Province, Iran. METHODS: Blood samples (n 
      = 500) were collected from symptomless individuals residing in Bashagard to
      evaluate Plasmodium infection by using microscopic, serological and nested-PCR
      techniques. RESULTS: Regarding the microscopic and nested-PCR analysis, no
      asymptomatic infection was detected among studied individuals. Totally, 1% of the
      studied population (5 of 500) had anti PvMSP-1(19)-specific IgG antibody;
      however, only 0.2% (1 of 500) of the individuals was seropositive to recombinant 
      PfMSP-1(19), using ELISA. CONCLUSION: This study showed no asymptomatic malaria
      infection in the studied population; hence malaria elimination is feasible and
      can be successfully carried out in this region.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0047 [doi]
AB  - In Vietnam, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are responsible for most malaria
      infections, and P. malariae and P. ovale infections are rarely reported.
      Nevertheless, species-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis on 2,303 blood 
      samples collected during a cross-sectional survey conducted in a forest area of
      central Vietnam identified 223 (9.7%) P. falciparum, 170 (7.4%) P. vivax, 95
      (4.1%) P. malariae, and 19 (0.8%) P. ovale mono-infections and 164 (7.1%) mixed
      infections. Of the 671 Plasmodium-positive samples by polymerase chain reaction, 
      only 331 were detected by microscopy. Microscopy poorly diagnosed P. malariae, P.
      ovale, and mixed infections. Clinical and sub-clinical infections occurred in all
      age groups. The risk for infection and disease decreased with age, probably
      because of acquired partial immunity. The common occurrence of sub-patent
      infections seems to indicate that the malaria burden is underestimated and that
      diagnostic and therapeutic policies should be adapted accordingly.

      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. METHODS: This phase III,
      multi-center, comparative, open-label, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial 
      included patients aged </=12 years, bodyweight >/=5 to <25 kg, with a reported
      history of fever at inclusion or in the previous 24 h and
      microscopically-confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Patients were
      randomized (2:1) to pyronaridine-artesunate granules (60/20 mg) once daily or
      artemether-lumefantrine crushed tablets (20/120 mg) twice daily, both dosed by
      bodyweight, orally (liquid suspension) for three days. RESULTS: Of 535 patients
      randomized, 355 received pyronaridine-artesunate and 180 received
      artemether-lumefantrine. Day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response
      (ACPR), corrected for re-infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      genotyping (per-protocol population) was 97.1% (329/339; 95% CI 94.6, 98.6) for
      pyronaridine-artesunate; 98.8% (165/167; 95% CI 95.7, 99.9) for
      artemether-lumefantrine. The primary endpoint was achieved:
      pyronaridine-artesunate PCR-corrected day-28 ACPR was statistically significantly
      >90% (P < .0001). Pyronaridine-artesunate was non-inferior to
      artemether-lumefantrine: treatment difference -1.8% (95% CI -4.3 to 1.6). The
      incidence of drug-related adverse events was 37.2% (132/355) with
      pyronaridine-artesunate, 44.4% (80/180) with artemether-lumefantrine. Clinical
      biochemistry results showed similar mean changes versus baseline in the two
      treatment groups. From day 3 until study completion, one patient in each
      treatment group had peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 times the upper limit 
      of normal (ULN) and peak total bilirubin >2xULN (i.e. within the Hy's law
      definition). CONCLUSIONS: The pyronaridine-artesunate pediatric granule
      formulation was efficacious and was non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine. The 
      adverse event profile was similar for the two comparators.
      Pyronaridine-artesunate should be considered for inclusion in paediatric malaria 
      treatment programmes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: identifier

TI  - Emergence of a new focus of Plasmodium malariae in forest villages of district
      Balaghat, Central India: implications for the diagnosis of malaria and its
      control.
PG  - 12-7
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During an epidemiological study (January-July 2012) on malaria in
      forest villages of Central India, Plasmodium malariae-like malaria parasites were
      observed in blood smears of fever cases. We aimed to confirm the presence of P.
      malariae using molecular tools i.e. species-specific nested polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. METHODS: All fever cases or cases with history
      of fever in 25 villages of Balaghat district were screened for malaria parasite
      using bivalent rapid diagnostic test and microscopy after obtaining written
      informed consent. Nested PCR was employed on microscopically suspected P.
      malariae cases. DNA sequences in the target region for PCR diagnosis were
      analysed for all the suspected cases of P. malariae. RESULTS: Among the 22
      microscopy suspected P. malariae cases, nested PCR confirmed the identity of P.
      malariae in 19 cases. Among these 14 were mono P. malariae infections, three were
      mixed infection of P. malariae with Plasmodium falciparum and two were mixed
      infection of P. malariae with Plasmodium vivax. Clinically P. malariae subjects
      generally presented with fever and headache. However, the typical 3-day pattern
      of quantum malaria was not observed. The parasite density of P. malariae was
      significantly lower than that of P. vivax and P. falciparum. DISCUSSIONS:
      Plasmodium malariae may have been in existence in forest villages of central
      India but escaped identification due to its close resemblance to P. vivax. The
      results re-affirm the importance of molecular methods of testing on routine basis
      for efficacious control strategies against malaria.

TI  - Evaluation of the malaria rapid diagnostic test SDFK90: detection of both PfHRP2 
      and Pf-pLDH.
PG  - 359
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections is important
      because of the potentially fatal complications. SDFK90 is a recently marketed
      malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) targeting both histidine-rich protein 2
      (PfHRP2) and P. falciparum-specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH).
      The present study evaluated its diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: SDFK90 was tested
      against a panel of stored whole blood samples (n= 591) obtained from
      international travellers suspected of malaria, including the four human
      Plasmodium species and Plasmodium negative samples. Microscopy was used as a
      reference method, corrected by PCR for species diagnosis. In addition, SDFK90 was
      challenged against 59 P. falciparum samples with parasite density >/=4% to assess
      the prozone effect (no or weak visible line on initial testing and a higher
      intensity upon 10-fold dilution). RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for the detection 
      of P. falciparum was 98.5% and reached 99.3% at parasite densities >100/mul.
      There were significantly more PfHRP2 lines visible compared to Pf-pLDH (97.3% vs 
      86.9%), which was mainly absent at parasite densities <100/mul. Specificity of
      SDFK90 was 98.8%. No lot-to-lot variability was observed (p = 1.00) and test
      results were reproducible. A prozone effect was seen for the PfHRP2 line in 14/59
      (23.7%) P. falciparum samples tested, but not for the Pf-pLDH line. Few minor
      shortcomings were observed in the kit's packaging and information insert.
      CONCLUSIONS: SDFK90 performed excellent for P. falciparum diagnosis. The
      combination of PfHRP2 and Pf-pLDH ensures a low detection threshold and counters 
      potential problems of PfHRP2 detection such as gene deletions and the prozone
      effect.

      groups in a hypoendemic area in Senegal.
PG  - 727-33
LID - 10.3855/jidc.2587 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study was conducted to determine for the first time the
      association between the erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) alleles and ABO
      blood groups in malaria patients living in Thies, a hypoendemic area in Senegal. 
      METHODOLOGY: In 2007, the EBA-175 alleles and blood group types were determined
      by nested PCR and the Simonin test respectively in blood samples obtained from
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria positive patients. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSION: In total, 129 patients were enrolled in the study. The EBA-175
      genotyping showed a prevalence of 67.45% for the F-allele, 27.90% for the
      C-allele and 4.65% of mixed C+F infection. The distribution of the ABO blood
      group type showed 59.8% for the O group, 19.7% for the A group, 17.2% for the B
      group, and 3.3% for the AB group. No correlation was noted between the EBA-175
      alleles and either the blood group type or parasitemia.

TI  - In vivo susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to artesunate in Binh Phuoc
      Province, Vietnam.
PG  - 355
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: By 2009, there were worrying signs from western Cambodia that
      parasitological responses to artesunate-containing treatment regimens for
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were slower than elsewhere which
      suggested the emergence of artemisinin resistance. Vietnam shares a long land
      border with Cambodia with a large number of migrants crossing it on a daily
      basis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate whether there is any
      evidence of a change in the parasitological response to the artemisinin
      derivatives in Vietnam. METHODS: From August 2010 to May 2011, a randomized
      controlled clinical trial in uncomplicated falciparum malaria was conducted to
      compare two doses of artesunate (AS) (2mg/kg/day versus 4 mg/kg/day for three
      days) followed by dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) and a control arm of
      DHA-PPQ. The goal was characterization of the current efficacy of artesunate in
      southern Vietnam. The primary endpoint of this study was the parasite clearance
      half-life; secondary endpoints included the parasite reduction ratios at 24 and
      48 hours and the parasite clearance time. RESULTS: 166 patients were recruited
      into the study. The median parasite clearance half-lives were 3.54 (AS 2mg/kg),
      2.72 (AS 4mg/kg), and 2.98 hours (DHA-PPQ) (p=0.19). The median
      parasite-reduction ratio at 24 hours was 48 in the AS 2mg/kg group compared with 
      212 and 113 in the other two groups, respectively (p=0.02). The proportions of
      patients with a parasite clearance time of >72 hours for AS 2mg/kg, AS 4mg/kg and
      DHA-PPQ were 27%, 27%, and 22%, respectively. Early treatment failure occurred in
      two (4%) and late clinical failure occurred in one (2%) of the 55 patients in the
      AS 2mg/kg group, as compared with none in the other two study arms. The
      PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (APCR) rates in the 
      three groups were 94%, 100%, and 100% (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrated faster P. falciparum parasite clearance in southern Vietnam than in 
      western Cambodia but slower clearance in comparison with historical data from
      Vietnam. Further studies to determine whether this represents the emergence of
      artemisinin resistance in this area are needed. Currently, the therapeutic
      response to DHA-PPQ remains satisfactory in southern Vietnam. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of
      imported malaria in Poland in 2010 in comparison to previous years. METHODS: The 
      study included malaria cases that were collected and registered by the State
      Sanitary Inspection in 2010 in Poland. Data reported was verified, processed and 
      published by National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene.
      All cases were laboratory confirmed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction or
      rapid diagnostic tests outlined by the EU case definition. Differences in the
      distribution of demographic, parasitological and clinical characteristics, and
      incidence were analyzed. RESULTS: In 2010, a total of 35 confirmed malaria cases 
      were notified in Poland, 13 more than 2009. All cases were imported, 49% from
      Africa, including 1 case with relapsing malaria caused by P. vivax and 2 cases of
      recrudescence falciparum malaria following failure of treatment. The number of
      cases acquired in Asia (37% of the total), mainly from India and Indonesia, was
      significantly higher than observed in previous years. Among cases with
      species-specific diagnosis 19 (63%) were caused by P. falciparum, 9 (30%) by P.
      vivax, one by P. ovale and one by P. malariae. The median age of all cases was 42
      years (range 9 months to 71 years), males comprised 69% of patients, females 31%,
      three patients were Indian citizens temporarily in Poland. Common reasons for
      travel to endemic countries were tourism (57%), work-related visits (37%), one
      person visited family and in one case the reason for travel was unknown. Sixteen 
      travelers took chemoprophylaxis, but only three of them appropriately (adherence 
      to the recommended drug regimen, continuation upon return and use of appropriate 
      medicines). In 2010, there were no deaths due to malaria and clinical course of
      disease was severe in 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with 2009, there was a 
      marked increase in the number of imported malaria cases in Poland, however the
      total number of notified cases remained low. Serious malaria (caused by P.
      falciparum), most frequently due to delayed diagnosis and treatment, is a
      continual problem. Such cases underline the need for adequate pre-travel
      information regarding the risk of malaria and preventive measures available.

TI  - A novel, sensitive assay for high-throughput molecular detection of plasmodia for
      active screening of malaria for elimination.

AB  - Although malaria remains one of the leading infectious diseases in the world, the
      decline in malaria transmission in some area makes it possible to consider
      elimination of the disease. As countries approach elimination, malaria diagnosis 
      needs to change from diagnosing ill patients to actively detecting infections in 
      all carriers, including asymptomatic and low-parasite-load patients. However, few
      of the current diagnostic methods have both the throughput and the sensitivity
      required. We adopted a sandwich RNA hybridization assay to detect genus
      Plasmodium 18S rRNA directly from whole-blood samples from Plasmodium falciparum 
      and Plasmodium vivax patients without RNA isolation. We tested the assay with 202
      febrile patients from areas where malaria is endemic, using 20 mul of each blood 
      sample in a 96-well plate format with a 2-day enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA)-like work flow. The results were compared with diagnoses obtained using
      microscopy, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and genus-specific real-time PCR. Our 
      assay identified all 66 positive samples diagnosed by microscopy, including 49
      poorly stored samples that underwent multiple freeze-thaw cycles due to resource 
      limitation. The assay uncovered three false-negative samples by microscopy and
      four false-negative samples by RDT and agreed completely with real-time PCR
      diagnosis. There was no negative sample by our assay that would show a positive
      result when tested with other methods. The detection limit of our assay for P.
      falciparum was 0.04 parasite/mul. The assay's simple work flow, high throughput, 
      and sensitivity make it suitable for active malaria screening.

TI  - A prospective comparative study of knowlesi, falciparum, and vivax malaria in
      Sabah, Malaysia: high proportion with severe disease from Plasmodium knowlesi and
      Plasmodium vivax but no mortality with early referral and artesunate therapy.
PG  - 383-97
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi commonly causes severe malaria in Malaysian
      Borneo, with high case-fatality rates reported. We compared risk, spectrum, and
      outcome of severe disease from P. knowlesi, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium
      vivax and outcomes following introduction of protocols for early referral and
      intravenous artesunate for all severe malaria. METHODS: From September 2010 to
      October 2011 we prospectively assessed nonpregnant patients aged >/=12 years
      admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH), Sabah, with polymerase chain
      reaction-confirmed Plasmodium monoinfection. Standardized referral and
      prereferral intravenous artesunate were instituted at district hospitals.
      RESULTS: Severe malaria occurred in 38 of 130 (29%) patients with P. knowlesi, 13
      of 122 (11%) with P. falciparum, and 7 of 43 (16%) with P. vivax. The commonest
      severity criteria in knowlesi malaria included parasitemia >100 000/microL (n =
      18), jaundice (n = 20), respiratory distress (n = 14), hypotension (n = 13), and 
      acute kidney injury (n = 9). On multivariate analysis, P. knowlesi was associated
      with a 2.96-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.19-7.38-fold) greater risk of
      severity than P. falciparum (P = .020); only parasitemia and schizontemia >10%
      independently predicted knowlesi severity. Risk of severe knowlesi malaria
      increased 11-fold with parasitemia >20 000/microL, and 28-fold with parasitemia
      >100 000/microL. Nearly all (92%) knowlesi malaria patients received oral
      artemisinin therapy; 36 of 38 (95%) and 39 of 92 (42%) with severe and nonsevere 
      disease, respectively, also received >/=1 dose of intravenous artesunate. No
      deaths occurred from any species. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium knowlesi is the
      commonest cause of severe malaria at QEH, with parasitemia the major risk factor 
      for severity. Early referral and treatment with artesunate was highly effective
      for severe malaria from all species and associated with zero mortality.

AB  - The need for a more sensitive and time-efficient assay for malaria has led to the
      development of molecular assays involving real-time PCR (qPCR), a procedure that 
      has the potential to detect low levels of parasitemia, identify mixed infections,
      and allow for precise differentiation of species via melting curve analysis or
      TaqMan fluorescence-labeled probes. Since the first study published in 2001 at
      least 17 assays have been developed, most of them using SSUrRNA as the target
      gene. We used qPCR to detect Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax by amplification 
      of mtDNA; this technique was evaluated on whole-blood samples from people living 
      in areas of malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon region located in the
      area of inclusion of highway BR-163 (Cuiaba-Santarem) in Para State: Sao Luiz do 
      Tapajos, a municipal district of Itaituba (N = 74); Tres Boeiras, a municipal
      district of Trairao (N = 134), and Sao Raimundo, a municipal district of Aveiro
      (N = 62). The results from the real-time PCR-based method were compared to
      conventional microscopy and to an established mtDNA-PCR assay. The qPCR (mtDNA)
      method was 16-19 times more efficient than the conventional PCR (mtDNA) and
      microscopy for detecting plasmodial infections.

      genes in controlling Plasmodium falciparum blood infection level.
PG  - e46441
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0046441 [doi]
AB  - Genetic variations in toll-like receptors and cytokine genes of the innate immune
      pathways have been implicated in controlling parasite growth and the pathogenesis
      of Plasmodium falciparum mediated malaria. We previously published genetic
      association of TLR4 non-synonymous and TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms with
      P.falciparum blood infection level and here we extend the study considerably by
      (i) investigating genetic dependence of parasite-load on interleukin-12B
      polymorphisms, (ii) reconstructing gene-gene interactions among candidate TLRs
      and cytokine loci, (iii) exploring genetic and functional impact of epistatic
      models and (iv) providing mechanistic insights into functionality of
      disease-associated regulatory polymorphisms. Our data revealed that carriage of
      AA (P = 0.0001) and AC (P = 0.01) genotypes of IL12B 3'UTR polymorphism was
      associated with a significant increase of mean log-parasitemia relative to rare
      homozygous genotype CC. Presence of IL12B+1188 polymorphism in five of six
      multifactor models reinforced its strong genetic impact on malaria phenotype.
      Elevation of genetic risk in two-component models compared to the corresponding
      single locus and reduction of IL12B (2.2 fold) and lymphotoxin-alpha (1.7 fold)
      expressions in patients'peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells under TLR4Thr399Ile
      risk genotype background substantiated the role of Multifactor Dimensionality
      Reduction derived models. Marked reduction of promoter activity of TNF-alpha risk
      haplotype (C-C-G-G) compared to wild-type haplotype (T-C-G-G) with (84%) and
      without (78%) LPS stimulation and the loss of binding of transcription factors
      detected in-silico supported a causal role of TNF-1031. Significantly lower
      expression of IL12B+1188 AA (5 fold) and AC (9 fold) genotypes compared to CC and
      under-representation (P = 0.0048) of allele A in transcripts of patients' PBMCs
      suggested an Allele-Expression-Imbalance. Allele (A+1188C) dependent differential
      stability (2 fold) of IL12B-transcripts upon actinomycin-D treatment and observed
      structural modulation (P = 0.013) of RNA-ensemble were the plausible explanations
      for AEI. In conclusion, our data provides functional support to the hypothesis
      that de-regulated receptor-cytokine axis of innate immune pathway influences
      blood infection level in P. falciparum malaria.

PG  - 951-6
AB  - Understanding the behaviour of malaria vectors is crucial for planning mosquito
      control programmes. The aim of this study was to estimate the malaria
      transmission intensity in 2 different ecological zones in a highly endemic
      malaria area of Sennar state in central Sudan over the main transmission period. 
      Species confirmation by PCR indicated that Anopheles arabiensis was the only
      malaria vector in the study area, with high anthropophilic behaviour (84.9%
      human-feeding). ELISA studies showed Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates rose 
      from 1.8% to 4.5% and the average entomological inoculation rates rose from 2.4
      to 4.2 infectious bites per person per night in September (the beginning) to
      November (the end) of the 3-month transmission season. The proportion of
      malaria-positive slides ranged from 50.1% to 57.0%. The proportion of human-blood
      positive mosquitoes was significantly higher in the irrigated area (El Booster)
      compared with the non-irrigated area (Rahal).

AB  - In a genome-wide screen for alpha-helical coiled coil motifs aiming at
      structurally defined vaccine candidates we identified PFF0165c. This protein is
      exported in the trophozoite stage and was named accordingly Trophozoite exported 
      protein 1 (Tex1). In an extensive preclinical evaluation of its coiled coil
      peptides Tex1 was identified as promising novel malaria vaccine candidate
      providing the rational for a comprehensive cell biological characterization of
      Tex1. Antibodies generated against an intrinsically unstructured N-terminal
      region of Tex1 and against a coiled coil domain were used to investigate
      cytological localization, solubility and expression profile. Co-localization
      experiments revealed that Tex1 is exported across the parasitophorous vacuole
      membrane and located to Maurer's clefts. Change in location is accompanied by a
      change in solubility: from a soluble state within the parasite to a
      membrane-associated state after export to Maurer's clefts. No classical export
      motifs such as PEXEL, signal sequence/anchor or transmembrane domain was
      identified for Tex1.

      study.
PG  - 1904-10
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence of the presence of Plasmodium vivax in the placenta is
      scarce and inconclusive. This information is relevant to understanding whether P.
      vivax affects placental function and how it may contribute to poor pregnancy
      outcomes. METHODS: Histopathologic examination of placental biopsies from 80
      Papua New Guinean pregnant women was combined with quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (qPCR) to confirm P. vivax infection and rule out coinfection with other
      Plasmodium species in placental and peripheral blood. Leukocytes and
      monocytes/macrophages were detected in placental sections by
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Monoinfection by P. vivax and Plasmodium
      falciparum was detected by qPCR in 8 and 10 placentas, respectively. Seven of the
      8 women with P. vivax placental monoinfection were negative in peripheral blood. 
      By histology, 3 placentas with P. vivax monoinfection showed parasitized
      erythrocytes in the intervillous space but no hemozoin in macrophages nor
      increased intervillous inflammatory cells. In contrast, 7 placentas positive for 
      P. falciparum presented parasites and hemozoin in macrophages or fibrin as well
      as intervillous inflammatory infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium vivax can be
      associated with placental infection. However, placental inflammation is not
      observed in P. vivax monoinfections, suggesting other causes of poor delivery
      outcomes associated with P. vivax infection.

TI  - Reconsideration of Anopheles rivulorum as a vector of Plasmodium falciparum in
      western Kenya: some evidence from biting time, blood preference, sporozoite
      positive rate, and pyrethroid resistance.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae, An. arabiensis, and An. funestus are widespread
      malaria vectors in Africa. Anopheles rivulorum is the next most widespread
      species in the An. funestus group. The role of An. rivulorum as a malaria vector 
      has not been fully studied, although it has been found to be a minor or
      opportunistic transmitter of Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: Mosquitoes were
      collected indoors over a 12-hour period using a light source attached to a
      rotating bottle collector in order to determine peak activity times and to
      provide DNA for meal source identification. Gravid female mosquitoes were
      collected indoors via an aspirator to generate F1 progeny for testing
      insecticidal susceptibility. Blood meal sources were identified using a
      multiplexed PCR assay for human and bovine cytochrome-B, and by matching
      sequences generated with primers targeting vertebrate and mammalian cytochrome-B 
      segments to the Genbank database. RESULTS: Anopheles rivulorum fed on human blood
      in the early evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when insecticide-treated bed nets
      are not in use, and the presence of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in 0.70% of
      the An. rivulorum individuals tested was demonstrated. Susceptibility to
      permethrin, deltamethrin, and DDT is higher in An. rivulorum (84.8%, 91.4%, and
      100%, respectively) than in An. funestus s.s. (36.8%, 36.4%, and 70%,
      respectively), whereas mortality rates for propoxur and fenitrothion were 100%
      for both species. Resistance to pyrethroids was very high in An. funestus s.s.
      and the potential of the development of high resistance was suspected in An.
      rivulorum. CONCLUSION: Given the tendency for An. rivulorum to be active early in
      the evening, the presence of P. falciparum in the species, and the potential for 
      the development of pyrethroid resistance, we strongly advocate reconsideration of
      the latent ability of this species as an epidemiologically important malaria
      vector.

TI  - Fc gamma receptor IIIB (FcgammaRIIIB) polymorphisms are associated with clinical 
      malaria in Ghanaian children.
PG  - e46197
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0046197 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria kills nearly a million people annually. Over 90% of
      these deaths occur in children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. A
      neutrophil mediated mechanism, the antibody dependent respiratory burst (ADRB),
      was recently shown to correlate with protection from clinical malaria. Human
      neutrophils constitutively express Fc gamma receptor-FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIB
      by which they interact with immunoglobulin (Ig) G (IgG)-subclass antibodies.
      Polymorphisms in exon 4 of FCGR2A and exon 3 of FCGR3B genes encoding FcgammaRIIA
      and FcgammaRIIIB respectively have been described to alter the affinities of both
      receptors for IgG. Here, associations between specific polymorphisms, encoding
      FcgammaRIIA p.H166R and FcgammaRIIIB-NA1/NA2/SH variants with clinical malaria
      were investigated in a longitudinal malaria cohort study. FcgammaRIIA-p.166H/R
      was genotyped by gene specific polymerase chain reaction followed by allele
      specific restriction enzyme digestion. FCGR3B-exon 3 was sequenced in 585
      children, aged 1 to 12 years living in a malaria endemic region of Ghana.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis found no association between
      FcgammaRIIA-166H/R polymorphism and clinical malaria. The A-allele of
      FCGR3B-c.233C>A (rs5030738) was significantly associated with protection from
      clinical malaria under two out of three genetic models (additive: p=0.0061;
      recessive: p=0.097; dominant: p=0.0076) of inheritance. The FcgammaRIIIB-SH
      allotype (CTGAAA) containing the 233A-allele (in bold) was associated with
      protection from malaria (p=0.049). The FcgammaRIIIB-NA2*03 allotype (CTGCGA), a
      variant of the classical FcgammaRIIIB-NA2 (CTGCAA) was associated with
      susceptibility to clinical malaria (p=0.0092). The present study is the first to 
      report an association between a variant of FcgammaRIIIB-NA2 and susceptibility to
      clinical malaria and provides justification for further functional
      characterization of variants of the classical FcgammaRIIIB allotypes. This would 
      be crucial to the improvement of neutrophil mediated functional assays such as
      the ADRB assay aimed at assessing the functionality of antibodies induced by
      candidate malaria vaccines.

TI  - Focused Screening and Treatment (FSAT): a PCR-based strategy to detect malaria
      parasite carriers and contain drug resistant P. falciparum, Pailin, Cambodia.
PG  - e45797
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0045797 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in Pailin 
      province, along the border between Thailand and Cambodia, have become resistant
      to artemisinin derivatives. To better define the epidemiology of P. falciparum
      populations and to assess the risk of the possible spread of these parasites
      outside Pailin, a new epidemiological tool named "Focused Screening and
      Treatment" (FSAT), based on active molecular detection of asymptomatic parasite
      carriers was introduced in 2010. Cross-sectional malariometric surveys using PCR 
      were carried out in 20 out of 109 villages in Pailin province. Individuals
      detected as P. falciparum carriers were treated with atovaquone-proguanil
      combination plus a single dose of primaquine if the patient was non-G6PD
      deficient. Interviews were conducted to elicit history of cross-border travel
      that might contribute to the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites. After
      directly observed treatment, patients were followed up and re-examined on day 7
      and day 28. Among 6931 individuals screened, prevalence of P. falciparum carriers
      was less than 1%, of whom 96% were asymptomatic. Only 1.6% of the individuals had
      a travel history or plans to go outside Cambodia, with none of those tested being
      positive for P. falciparum. Retrospective analysis, using 2010 routine
      surveillance data, showed significant differences in the prevalence of
      asymptomatic carriers discovered by FSAT between villages classified as "high
      risk" and "low risk" based on malaria incidence data. All positive individuals
      treated and followed-up until day 28 were cured. No mutant-type allele related to
      atovaquone resistance was found. FSAT is a potentially useful tool to detect,
      treat and track clusters of asymptomatic carriers of P. falciparum along with
      providing valuable epidemiological information regarding cross-border movements
      of potential malaria parasite carriers and parasite gene flow.

TI  - Opsonization of malaria-infected erythrocytes activates the inflammasome and
      enhances inflammatory cytokine secretion by human macrophages.
PG  - 343
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-343 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibody opsonization of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes 
      (IE) plays a crucial role in anti-malarial immunity by promoting clearance of
      blood-stage infection by monocytes and macrophages. The effects of phagocytosis
      of opsonized IE on macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine responses are poorly
      understood. METHODS: Phagocytic clearance, cytokine response and intracellular
      signalling were measured using IFN-gamma-primed human monocyte-derived
      macrophages (MDM) incubated with opsonized and unopsonized trophozoite-stage CS2 
      IE, a chondroitin sulphate-binding malaria strain. Cytokine secretion was
      measured by bead array or ELISA, mRNA using quantitative PCR, and activation of
      NF-kappaB by Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Data were
      analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test as
      appropriate. RESULTS: Unopsonized CS2 IE were not phagocytosed whereas IE
      opsonized with pooled patient immune serum (PPS) were (Phagocytic index
      (PI)=18.4, [SE 0.38] n=3). Unopsonized and opsonized IE induced expression of
      TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA by MDM and activated NF-kappaB to a similar extent.
      Unopsonized IE induced secretion of IL-6 (median= 622 pg/ml [IQR=1,250-240], n=9)
      but no IL-1beta or TNF, whereas PPS-opsonized IE induced secretion of IL-1beta
      (18.6 pg/mL [34.2-14.4]) and TNF (113 pg/ml [421-17.0]) and increased IL-6
      secretion (2,195 pg/ml [4,658-1,095]). Opsonized, but not unopsonized, CS2 IE
      activated caspase-1 cleavage and enzymatic activity in MDM showing that Fc
      receptor-mediated phagocytosis activates the inflammasome. MDM attached to
      IgG-coated surfaces however secreted IL-1beta in response to unopsonized IE,
      suggesting that internalization of IE is not absolutely required to activate the 
      inflammasome and stimulate IL-1beta secretion. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that 
      IL-6 secretion from MDM in response to CS2 IE does not require phagocytosis,
      whereas secretion of TNF and IL-1beta is dependent on Fcgamma receptor-mediated
      phagocytosis; for IL-1beta, this occurs by activation of the inflammasome. The
      data presented in this paper show that generating antibody responses to
      blood-stage malaria parasites is potentially beneficial both in reducing
      parasitaemia via Fcgamma receptor-dependent macrophage phagocytosis and in
      generating a robust pro-inflammatory response.

AB  - Preparation of raw, untreated biological samples remains a major challenge in
      microfluidics. We present a novel microfluidic device based on the integration of
      printed circuit boards and an isotachophoresis assay for sample preparation of
      nucleic acids from biological samples. The device has integrated resistive
      heaters and temperature sensors as well as a 70 mum x 300 mum x 3.7 cm
      microfluidic channel connecting two 15 muL reservoirs. We demonstrated this
      device by extracting pathogenic nucleic acids from 1 muL dispensed volume of
      whole blood spiked with Plasmodium falciparum. We dispensed whole blood directly 
      onto an on-chip reservoir, and the system's integrated heaters simultaneously
      lysed and mixed the sample. We used isotachophoresis to extract the nucleic acids
      into a secondary buffer via isotachophoresis. We analyzed the convective mixing
      action with micro particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) and verified the purity 
      and amount of extracted nucleic acids using off-chip quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). We achieved a clinically relevant limit of detection of 500
      parasites per microliter. The system has no moving parts, and the process is
      potentially compatible with a wide range of on-chip hybridization or
      amplification assays.

      phenotype.
PG  - 1911-9
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) adhere to host cell
      receptors, allowing parasites to sequester into deep vascular beds of various
      organs. This defining phenomenon of malaria pathogenesis is key to the severe
      clinical complications associated with cerebral and placental malaria. The
      principal ligand associated with the binding to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) that 
      allows placental sequestration of IEs is a P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
      protein 1 (PfEMP1) family member encoded by the var2csa gene. METHODS: Here, we
      investigated the transcription pattern of var genes by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction, the expression of VAR2CSA, protein by flow cytometry, and the
      CSA-binding ability of IEs collected at different stages of pregnancy using a
      static-based Petri dish assay. RESULTS: Through comparison with the profiles of
      isolates from nonpregnant hosts, we report several lines of evidence showing that
      parasites infecting women during pregnancy preferentially express VAR2CSA
      protein, and that selection for the capacity to adhere to CSA via VAR2CSA
      expression occurs early in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the
      placental tropism of P. falciparum is already established in the first trimester 
      of pregnancy, with consequent implications for the development of the pathology
      associated with placental malaria.

TI  - Surveillance of molecular markers of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine 5 years after the change of malaria treatment policy
      in Ghana.
PG  - 996-1003
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0202 [doi]
AB  - In 2005, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) became the drug of choice for
      intermittent preventive treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy
      (IPTp) in Ghana. Reports suggest the use of SP by others to treat uncomplicated
      malaria. Because of the increased use of SP, the prevalence of mutations in the
      genes, dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps),
      linked to SP resistance in P. falciparum were determined. Blood samples from 945 
      children with uncomplicated malaria collected at nine sites from 2003 to 2010
      were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
      polymorphism. Prevalence of the dhfr triple and dhfr plus dhps quadruple
      mutations showed significant increase in trend from 2003 to 2010 (chi(2) = 18.78,
      P < 0.001, chi(2) = 15.11, P < 0.001, respectively). For dhps double mutant G437 
      + E540 the prevalence was low (1.12%) caused by the very low prevalence of E540. 
      Our findings show the wide use of SP in Ghana and therefore its use for IPTp
      needs to be closely monitored.

      dried blood spots.
PG  - 339
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-339 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood samples collected in epidemiological and clinical
      investigations and then stored, often at room temperature, as blood spots dried
      on a filter paper have become one of the most popular source of material for
      further molecular analyses of malaria parasites. The dried blood spots are often 
      archived so that they can be used for further retrospective investigations of
      parasite prevalence, or as new genetic markers come to the fore. However, the
      suitability of the template obtained from dried blood spots that have been stored
      for long periods for DNA amplification is not known. METHODS: DNA from 267
      archived blood spots collected over a period of 12 years from persons with
      microscopically confirmed Plasmodium falciparum infection was purified by one of 
      two methods, Chelex and Qiagen columns. These templates were subjected to highly 
      sensitive nested PCR amplification targeting three parasite loci that differ in
      length and/or copy number. RESULTS: When a 1.6 kb fragment of the parasites'
      small subunit ribosomal RNA was targeted (primary amplification), the efficiency 
      of P. falciparum detection decreased in samples archived for more than six years,
      reaching very low levels for those stored for more than 10 years. Positive
      amplification was generally obtained more often with Qiagen-extracted templates. 
      P. falciparum could be detected in 32 of the 40 negative Qiagen-extracted
      templates when a microsatellite of about 180 bp was targeted. The remaining eight
      samples gave a positive amplification when a small region of 238 bp of the higher
      copy number (20 to 200) mitochondrial genome was targeted. CONCLUSIONS: The
      average length of DNA fragments that can be recovered from dried blood spots
      decreases with storage time. Recovery of the DNA is somewhat improved, especially
      in older samples, by the use of a commercial DNA purification column, but targets
      larger than 1.5 kb are unlikely to be present 10 years after the initial blood
      collection, when the average length of the DNA fragments present is likely to be 
      around a few hundred bp. In conclusion, the utility of archived dried blood spots
      for molecular analyses decreases with storage time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem in Togo. The national
      malaria control programme in Togo changed the anti-malarial treatment policy from
      monotherapy to artemisinin combination therapy in 2004. This study reports the
      results of therapeutic efficacy studies conducted on artemether-lumefantrine and 
      artesunate-amodiaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria in Togo, between 2005 and 2009. METHODS: Children between 6 and 59 months
      of age, who were symptomatically infected with P. falciparum, were treated with
      either artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine. The primary end-point
      was the 28-day cure rate, PCR-corrected for reinfection and recrudescence.
      Studies were conducted according to the standardized WHO protocol for the
      assessment of the efficacy of anti-malarial treatment. Differences between
      categorical data were compared using the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact
      test where cell counts were </= 5. Differences in continuous data were compared
      using a t-test. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were conducted in five sentinel
      sites, with 459, 505 and 332 children included in 2005, 2007 and 2009,
      respectively. The PCR-corrected 28-day cure rates using the per-protocol analysis
      were between 96%-100% for artemether-lumefantrine and 94%-100% for
      artesunate-amodiaquine. CONCLUSIONS: Both formulations of artemisinin-based
      combination therapy were effective over time and no severe adverse events related
      to the treatment were reported during the studies.

AB  - Malaria remains one of the major killers of humankind and persists to threaten
      the lives of more than one-third of the world's population. Given that human
      malaria can now be caused by five species of Plasmodium, i.e., Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and the
      recently included Plasmodium knowlesi, there is a critical need not only to
      augment global health efforts in malaria control but also, more importantly, to
      develop a rapid, accurate, species-sensitive/species-specific, and economically
      effective diagnostic method for malaria caused by these five species. Therefore, 
      in the present study, a straightforward single-step hexaplex PCR system targeting
      five human Plasmodium 18S small-subunit rRNAs (ssu rRNAs) was designed, and the
      system successfully detected all five human malaria parasites. In addition, this 
      system enables the differentiation of single infection as well as mixed
      infections up to the two-species level. This assay was validated with 50 randomly
      blinded test and 184 clinical samples suspected to indicate malaria. This
      hexaplex PCR system is not only an ideal alternative for routine malaria
      diagnosis in laboratories with conventional PCR machines but also adds value to
      diagnoses when there is a lack of an experienced microscopist or/and when the
      parasite morphology is confusing. Indeed, this system will definitely enhance the
      accuracy and accelerate the speed in the diagnosis of malaria, as well as improve
      the efficacy of malaria treatment and control, in addition to providing reliable 
      data from epidemiological surveillance studies.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0045542 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum has been widely studied,
      but its effects on parasite dynamics are poorly understood. Acquisition and
      clearance rates of untreated infections are key elements of the dynamics of
      malaria, but estimating these parameters is challenging because of frequent
      super-infection and imperfect detectability of parasites. Consequently,
      information on effects of host immune status or age on infection dynamics is
      fragmentary. METHODS: An age-stratified cohort of 347 individuals from Northern
      Ghana was sampled six times at 2 month intervals. High-throughput capillary
      electrophoresis was used to genotype the msp-2 locus of all P. falciparum
      infections detected by PCR. Force of infection (FOI) and duration were estimated 
      for each age group using an immigration-death model that allows for imperfect
      detection of circulating parasites. RESULTS: Allowing for imperfect detection
      substantially increased estimates of FOI and duration. Effects of naturally
      acquired immunity on the FOI and duration would be reflected in age dependence in
      these indices, but in our cohort data FOI tended to increase with age in
      children. Persistence of individual parasite clones was characteristic of all
      age-groups. Duration peaked in 5-9 year old children (average duration 319 days, 
      95% confidence interval 318;320). CONCLUSIONS: The main age-dependence is on
      parasite densities, with only small age-variations in the FOI and persistence of 
      infections. This supports the hypothesis that acquired immunity controls
      transmission mainly by limiting blood-stage parasite densities rather than
      changing rates of acquisition or clearance of infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chhattisgarh state in central India is highly endemic for malaria and
      contributes about 13% of annually reported malaria cases in the country with
      predominance of P. falciparum. Entomological investigations were carried out in a
      tribal forested area of district Bastar located in the southern part of
      Chhattisgarh state to record the prevalence of sibling species of Anopheles
      fluviatilis and An. culicifacies complexes. The vector species complexes were
      investigated at sibling species level for their biology in terms of resting and
      feeding behavior and malaria transmission potential. METHODS: Indoor resting
      vector mosquitoes collected during 2010-2011 were identified to sibling species
      by cytotaxonomy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The blood meal source 
      analysis and incrimination studies were done at sibling species level by counter 
      current immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      respectively. RESULTS: Analysis of sibling species composition revealed
      predominance of An. fluviatilis species S in the study area, which was found to
      be highly anthropophagic and rested in human dwellings whereas the sympatric
      species T was primarily zoophagic. Incrimination studies showed high sporozoite
      rate in species S, thereby confirming its vectorial efficiency. An. culicifacies 
      was encountered in low numbers and comprised species B and C in almost equal
      proportion. Both these species were found to be exclusively zoophagic.
      CONCLUSION: The observations made strongly suggest that species S of Fluviatilis 
      Complex is the principal vector of malaria in certain forest areas of district
      Bastar, Chhattisgarh state and should be the target species for vector control
      operation. Vector control strategies based on biological characteristics of
      Fluviatilis S will lead to substantial decline in malaria incidence in such
      areas.

PG  - 212
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in Ghana. We present a
      site-specific entomological study of malaria vectors and transmission indices as 
      part of an effort to develop a site for the testing of improved control
      strategies including possible vaccine trials. METHODS: Pyrethrum spray catches
      (PSC), and indoor and outdoor human landing collections of adult female
      anopheline mosquitoes were carried out over a six-month period (November 2005 -
      April 2006) at Kpone-on-Sea, a fishing village in southern Ghana. These were
      morphologically identified to species level and sibling species of the Anopheles 
      gambiae complex further characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum
      mosquito infectivity and host blood meal sources. Parity rate was examined based 
      on dilatation of ovarian tracheoles following dissection. RESULTS: Of the 1233
      Anopheles mosquitoes collected, An. gambiae s.l. was predominant (99.5%),
      followed by An. funestus (0.4%) and An. pharoensis (0.1%). All An. gambiae s.l.
      examined (480) were identified as An. gambiae s.s. with a majority of M molecular
      form (98.2%) and only 1.8% S form with no record of M/S hybrid. A significantly
      higher proportion of anophelines were observed outdoors relative to indoors (chi2
      = 159.34, df = 1, p < 0.0000). Only An. gambiae M molecular form contributed to
      transmission with a high degree of anthropophily, parity rate and an estimated
      entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 62.1 infective bites/person/year. The
      Majority of the infective bites occurred outdoors after 09.00 pm reaching peaks
      between 12.00-01.00 am and 03.00-04.00 am. CONCLUSION: Anopheles gambiae M
      molecular form is responsible for maintaining the status quo of malaria in the
      surveyed site during the study period. The findings provide a baseline for
      evidence-based planning and implementation of improved malaria interventions. The
      plasticity observed in biting patterns especially the combined outdoor and early 
      biting behavior of the vector may undermine the success of insecticide-based
      strategies using insecticide treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spray (IRS). 
      As such, novel or improved vector interventions should be informed by the local
      malaria epidemiology data as it relates to vector behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the application value of multiplex PCR in the diagnosis of 
      malaria in field. METHODS: The plasmodium genus-specific primer, Plasmodium
      vivax, P. falciparum species-specific primers were synthesis based on the
      specific target segments of small subunit of 18 S rRNA ribosomal. The multiplex
      PCR system was optimized, and a PCR diagnostic method of malaria was established 
      based on the genomic specific DNA fragment of P. vivax, and P. falciparum was
      amplified in the same PCR reaction system. The sensitivity, specificity, and the 
      value of field application of the multiplex PCR were investigated. RESULTS: The
      sizes of amplification products of multiplex PCR amplifying genomic DNA of P.
      vivax and P. falciparum were 833 bp and 1 451 bp, respectively, and the
      amplification did not take place with the samples DNA of P. berghei, P.
      cynomolgus and healthy human blood. The sensitivities of multiplex PCR to detect 
      P. vivax and P.falciparum were 1.1 x 10(-6) and 5.6 x 10(-7) parasitemia,
      respectively. Compared with the microscopic examination, the positive rate of
      multiplex PCR to detect 119 cases of field samples was 54%, missed diagnosis rate
      was 0.8%, and the misdiagnosis rate was naught, while the positive rate of the
      microscopic examination was 53%, its misdiagnosis rate and missed diagnosis rate 
      were 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The compliance rate between the multiplex PCR
      and microscopic examination was 94%. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR for detecting 
      malaria is simple, rapid, specific, sensitive, etc., which is suitable for the
      differential diagnosis of suspected cases, and molecular epidemiology
      investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence of malaria and the factors associated with the 
      infection in migrants in the southern border of Mexico, during 2008. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: In 706 migrants, active malaria infection was investigated using a
      rapid diagnostic test and PCR and past infection using serology. A questionnaire 
      was applied to investigate the conditions associated to infection. RESULTS: 85.6%
      originated from Central America, none presented an active infection, although
      4.2% were seropositive, most of these came from the countries with the highest
      malaria incidence in the region. Seropositivity was associated with the number of
      previous malaria episodes (OR=1.44; IC95% 1.04-2.00), years living in their
      community of origin (OR=1.03; IC95% 1.00-1.07), and knowledge and self-medication
      with anti-malaria drugs (OR=3.38; IC95% 1.48-7.67). CONCLUSIONS: . The previous
      exposure of migrants and the difficulties for their detection indicate the need
      of new strategies for the epidemiological surveillance for these populations.

AB  - Levels of genetic diversity of the malaria parasites and multiclonal infections
      are correlated with transmission intensity. In order to monitor the effect of
      strengthened malaria control efforts in recent years at the China-Myanmar border 
      area, we followed the temporal dynamics of genetic diversity of three polymorphic
      antigenic markers msp1, msp2, and glurp in the Plasmodium falciparum populations.
      Despite reduced malaria prevalence in the region, parasite populations exhibited 
      high levels of genetic diversity. Genotyping 258 clinical samples collected in
      four years detected a total of 22 PCR size alleles. Multiclonal infections were
      detected in 45.7% of the patient samples, giving a minimum multiplicity of
      infection of 1.41. The majority of alleles experienced significant temporal
      fluctuations through the years. Haplotype diversity based on the three-locus
      genotypes ranged from the lowest in 2009 at 0.33 to the highest in 2010 at 0.80. 
      Sequencing of msp1 fragments from 36 random samples of five allele size groups
      detected 13 different sequences, revealing an additional layer of genetic
      complexity. This study suggests that despite reduced prevalence of malaria
      infections in this region, the parasite population size and transmission
      intensity remained high enough to allow effective genetic recombination of the
      parasites and continued maintenance of genetic diversity.

AB  - According to the hygiene hypothesis, reduced exposure to infections could explain
      the rise of atopic diseases in high-income countries. Helminths are hypothesised 
      to alter the host's immune response in order to avoid elimination and, as a
      consequence, also reduce the host responsiveness to potential allergens. To
      elucidate the effect of current helminth infections on immune responsiveness in
      humans, we measured cytokine production in a rural Ghanaian population in an area
      with multiple endemic parasites including malaria, intestinal helminths and
      protozoa. Multiplex real-time PCR in stool samples was used for the detection of 
      four gastrointestinal helminths, of which only Necator americanus was commonly
      present. A similar assay was used to test for Giardia lamblia in stool samples
      and malaria infection in venous blood samples. Levels of the cytokines
      interleukin (IL)-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, IL-13, and 
      interferon (IFN)-gamma were determined in whole-blood samples ex vivo-stimulated 
      either with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zymosan (for innate cytokine production)
      or the T-cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). There were no significant
      differences in either innate or PHA-stimulated cytokine production dependent on
      current N. americanus infection. Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection was
      associated with a pro-inflammatory response indicated by increased innate
      production of TNF-alpha, IL-17 and IL-6. There was no clear pattern in cytokine
      responses dependent on G. lamblia-infection. In conclusion, in this rural
      Ghanaian population current N. americanus infections are not associated with
      altered immune function, while infection with P. falciparum is associated with
      pro-inflammatory innate immune responses.

TI  - Molecular surveillance for drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in clinical and
      subclinical populations from three border regions of Burma/Myanmar:
      cross-sectional data and a systematic review of resistance studies.
PG  - 333
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Confirmation of artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance in Plasmodium 
      falciparum along the Thai-Myanmar border has inspired a global response to
      contain and monitor drug resistance to avert the disastrous consequences of a
      potential spread to Africa. However, resistance data from Myanmar are sparse,
      particularly from high-risk areas where limited health services and decades of
      displacement create conditions for resistance to spread. Subclinical infections
      may represent an important reservoir for resistance genes that confer a fitness
      disadvantage relative to wild-type alleles. This study estimates the prevalence
      of resistance genotypes in three previously unstudied remote populations in
      Myanmar and tests the a priori hypothesis that resistance gene prevalence would
      be higher among isolates collected from subclinical infections than isolates
      collected from febrile clinical patients. A systematic review of resistance
      studies is provided for context. METHODS: Community health workers in Karen and
      Kachin States and an area spanning the Indo-Myanmar border collected dried blood 
      spots from 988 febrile clinical patients and 4,591 villagers with subclinical
      infection participating in routine prevalence surveys. Samples positive for P.
      falciparum 18 s ribosomal RNA by real-time PCR were genotyped for P. falciparum
      multidrug resistance protein (pfmdr1) copy number and the pfcrt K76T polymorphism
      using multiplex real-time PCR. RESULTS: Pfmdr1 copy number increase and the pfcrt
      K76 polymorphism were determined for 173 and 269 isolates, respectively. Mean
      pfmdr1 copy number was 1.2 (range: 0.7 to 3.7). Pfmdr1 copy number increase was
      present in 17.5%, 9.6% and 11.1% of isolates from Karen and Kachin States and the
      Indo-Myanmar border, respectively. Pfmdr1 amplification was more prevalent in
      subclinical isolates (20.3%) than clinical isolates (6.4%, odds ratio 3.7, 95%
      confidence interval 1.1 - 12.5). Pfcrt K76T prevalence ranged from 90-100%.
      CONCLUSIONS: Community health workers can contribute to molecular surveillance of
      drug resistance in remote areas of Myanmar. Marginal and displaced populations
      under-represented among previous resistance investigations can and should be
      included in resistance surveillance efforts, particularly once genetic markers of
      artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance are identified. Subclinical infections may
      contribute to the epidemiology of drug resistance, but determination of gene
      amplification from desiccated filter samples requires further validation when DNA
      concentration is low.

TI  - Cytokine balance in human malaria: does Plasmodium vivax elicit more inflammatory
      responses than Plasmodium falciparum?
PG  - e44394
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which humans regulate pro- and anti-inflammatory
      responses on exposure to different malaria parasites remains unclear. Although
      Plasmodium vivax usually causes a relatively benign disease, this parasite has
      been suggested to elicit more host inflammation per parasitized red blood cell
      than P. falciparum. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured plasma
      concentrations of seven cytokines and two soluble tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha receptors, and evaluated clinical and laboratory outcomes, in
      Brazilians with acute uncomplicated infections with P. vivax (n = 85), P.
      falciparum (n = 30), or both species (n = 12), and in 45 asymptomatic carriers of
      low-density P. vivax infection. Symptomatic vivax malaria patients, compared to
      those infected with P. falciparum or both species, had more intense paroxysms,
      but they had no clear association with a pro-inflammatory imbalance. To the
      contrary, these patients had higher levels of the regulatory cytokine interleukin
      (IL)-10, which correlated positively with parasite density, and elevated
      IL-10/TNF-alpha, IL-10/interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-10/IL-6 and sTNFRII/TNF-alpha
      ratios, compared to falciparum or mixed-species malaria patient groups. Vivax
      malaria patients had the highest levels of circulating soluble TNF-alpha receptor
      sTNFRII. Levels of regulatory cytokines returned to normal values 28 days after
      P. vivax clearance following chemotherapy. Finally, asymptomatic carriers of low 
      P. vivax parasitemias had substantially lower levels of both inflammatory and
      regulatory cytokines than did patients with clinical malaria due to either
      species. CONCLUSIONS: Controlling fast-multiplying P. falciparum blood stages
      requires a strong inflammatory response to prevent fulminant infections, while
      reducing inflammation-related tissue damage with early regulatory cytokine
      responses may be a more cost-effective strategy in infections with the less
      virulent P. vivax parasite. The early induction of regulatory cytokines may be a 
      critical mechanism protecting vivax malaria patients from severe clinical
      complications.

      Southeast Asian ovalocytosis in two cohorts and a case-control study.
PG  - e1001305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The erythrocyte polymorphism, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)
      (which results from a 27-base pair deletion in the erythrocyte band 3 gene,
      SLC4A1Delta27) protects against cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum;
      however, it is unknown whether this polymorphism also protects against P. vivax
      infection and disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The association between SAO and P.
      vivax infection was examined through genotyping of 1,975 children enrolled in
      three independent epidemiological studies conducted in the Madang area of Papua
      New Guinea. SAO was associated with a statistically significant 46% reduction in 
      the incidence of clinical P. vivax episodes (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 
      = 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.72, p<0.0001) in a cohort of infants aged 3-21 months and a
      significant 52% reduction in P. vivax (blood-stage) reinfection diagnosed by PCR 
      (95% CI 22-71, p = 0.003) and 55% by light microscopy (95% CI 13-77, p = 0.014), 
      respectively, in a cohort of children aged 5-14 years. SAO was also associated
      with a reduction in risk of P. vivax parasitaemia in children 3-21 months
      (1,111/microl versus 636/microl, p = 0.011) and prevalence of P. vivax infections
      in children 15-21 months (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.67, p = 0.001).
      In a case-control study of children aged 0.5-10 years, no child with SAO was
      found among 27 cases with severe P. vivax or mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria
      (OR = 0, 95% CI 0-1.56, p = 0.11). SAO was associated with protection against
      severe P. falciparum malaria (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.87, p = 0.014) but no
      effect was seen on either the risk of acquiring blood-stage infections or
      uncomplicated episodes with P. falciparum. Although Duffy antigen receptor
      expression and function were not affected on SAO erythrocytes compared to non-SAO
      children, high level (>90% binding inhibition) P. vivax Duffy binding
      protein-specific binding inhibitory antibodies were observed significantly more
      often in sera from SAO than non-SAO children (SAO, 22.2%; non-SAO, 6.7%; p =
      0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In three independent studies, we observed strong
      associations between SAO and protection against P. vivax malaria by a mechanism
      that is independent of the Duffy antigen. P. vivax malaria may have contributed
      to shaping the unique host genetic adaptations to malaria in Asian and Oceanic
      populations. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms within the PfATP6 gene have been indicated as potential
      molecular markers for artemisinin efficacy. Since 2004, the use of artemisinin
      combination therapy (ACT) was introduced as first-line treatment of the
      uncomplicated malaria cases in Suriname. The aim of this research was to
      determine changes in Suriname in the status of the polymorphic markers in the
      PfATP6 gene before and after the adoption of the ACT-regimen, particularly of the
      S769N mutation, which was reported to be associated with in vitro Artemether
      resistance in the neighboring country French Guiana. METHODS: The PfATP6 gene
      from Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Suriname was investigated in 28 samples
      using PCR amplification and restriction enzyme analysis, to assess and determine 
      the prevalence of potentially interesting single nucleotide polymorphisms. The
      polymorphisms [L263E; A623E; S769N], which may be associated with the artemisinin
      resistant phenotype were characterized in parasites from three endemic regions
      before and after the adoption of the ACT-regimen. In addition, the status of
      these molecular markers was compared in paired P. falciparum isolates from
      patients with recurring malaria after controlled ACT. RESULTS: All the
      investigated samples exhibit the wild-type genotype at all three positions; L263,
      A623, S769. CONCLUSION: All investigated isolates before and after the adoption
      of the ACT-regimen and independent of endemic region harbored the wild-type
      genotype for the three investigated polymorphisms. The study revealed that
      decreased artemisinin susceptibility could occur independent from PfATP6
      mutations, challenging the assumption that artemisinin resistance is associated
      with these mutations in the PfATP6 gene.

      disease in Papua New Guinean children 1-5 years of age.
PG  - 1771-80
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax forms long-lasting hypnozoites in the liver. How
      much they contribute to the burden of P. vivax malaria in children living in
      highly endemic areas is unknown. METHODS: In this study, 433 Papua New Guinean
      children aged 1-5 years were Randomized to receive artesunate (7 days) plus
      primaquine (14 days), artesunate alone or no treatment and followed up actively
      for recurrent Plasmodium infections and disease for 40 weeks. RESULTS: Treatment 
      with artesunate-primaquine reduced the risk of P. vivax episodes by 28% (P =
      .042) and 33% (P = .015) compared with the artesunate and control arms,
      respectively. A significant reduction was observed only in the first 3 months of 
      follow-up (artesunate-primaquine vs control, -58% [P = .004];
      artesunate-primaquine vs artesunate, -49% [P = .031]) with little difference
      thereafter. Primaquine treatment also reduced the risk of quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction- and light microscopy-positive P. vivax reinfections by
      44% (P < .001) and 67% (P < .001), respectively. Whereas primaquine treatment did
      not change the risk of reinfection with Plasmodium falciparum, fewer P.
      falciparum clinical episodes were observed in the artesunate-primaquine arm.
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypnozoites are an important source of P. vivax infection and
      contribute substantially to the high burden of P. vivax disease observed in young
      Papua New Guinean children. Even in highly endemic areas with a high risk of
      reinfection, antihypnozoite treatment should be given to all cases with
      parasitologically confirmed P. vivax infections.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism in Plasmodium falciparum: differentiation of parasite
      isolates of high & low virulence by RAPD.
PG  - 292-5
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The increase in Plasmodium falciparum infections which
      are associated with severe and complicated malaria and drug resistance has made
      control of malaria a difficult task. Extensive genetic polymorphism in P.
      falciparum has been reported from several parts of the world which affects the
      efficacy of sub-unit vaccines. The knowledge of genotypes of the parasite in a
      geographical region is therefore, important for effective management and control.
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of random
      amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique for differentiation of P.
      falciparum isolates from patients presenting with severe (cerebral malaria) and
      mild malaria. METHODS: Genetic polymorphism in 21 P. falciparum isolates obtained
      from patients found positive for P. falciparum by light microscopy was studied by
      RAPD-PCR analysis. Eleven RAPD primers were used for analysis of 21 P. falciparum
      isolates obtained from cerebral and non-cerebral malaria patients. RESULTS: Of
      the 11 primers, only three (E-4, E-8, and R-8) produced useful polymorphic
      patterns. The cluster analysis based on UPGMA demonstrated that isolates causing 
      cerebral malaria cluster separately from those causing uncomplicated malaria.
      However, the analysis of phylogenic tree showed that P. falciparum isolates
      causing non-cerebral and cerebral malaria clustered separately but showed
      relatedness. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study
      showed that the RAPD-PCR was able to differentiate the isolates causing severe
      and mild malaria. The cluster analysis of the phylogenic tree suggested that the 
      virulent strains evolved from less virulent strains as it clustered separately.
      RAPD technique may be useful in discriminating between the different isolates of 
      the same species resulting in different clinical profiles.

TI  - Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria diagnosis in the Peruvian Amazon: impact of
      pfhrp2 gene deletions and cross-reactions.
PG  - e43094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0043094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Peruvian Amazon, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      malaria are endemic in rural areas, where microscopy is not available. Malaria
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide quick and accurate diagnosis. However,
      pfhrp2 gene deletions may limit the use of histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2)
      detecting RDTs. Further, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with P. vivax-specific 
      test lines and vice versa may impair diagnostic specificity. METHODS: Thirteen
      RDT products were evaluated on 179 prospectively collected malaria positive
      samples. Species diagnosis was performed by microscopy and confirmed by PCR.
      Pfhrp2 gene deletions were assessed by PCR. RESULTS: Sensitivity for P.
      falciparum diagnosis was lower for PfHRP2 compared to P. falciparum-specific
      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH)-detecting RDTs (71.6% vs. 98.7%,
      p<0.001). Most (19/21) false negative PfHRP2 results were associated with pfhrp2 
      gene deletions (25.7% of 74 P. falciparum samples). Diagnostic sensitivity for P.
      vivax (101 samples) was excellent, except for two products. In 10/12 P.
      vivax-detecting RDT products, cross-reactions with the PfHRP2 or Pf-pLDH line
      occurred at a median frequency of 2.5% (range 0%-10.9%) of P. vivax samples
      assessed. In two RDT products, two and one P. falciparum samples respectively
      cross-reacted with the Pv-pLDH line. Two Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH-detecting RDTs showed
      excellent sensitivity with few (1.0%) cross-reactions but showed faint Pf-pLDH
      lines in 24.7% and 38.9% of P. falciparum samples. CONCLUSION: PfHRP2-detecting
      RDTs are not suitable in the Peruvian Amazon due to pfhrp2 gene deletions. Two
      Pf-pLDH-detecting RDTs performed excellently and are promising RDTs for this
      region although faint test lines are of concern.

PG  - e42496
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042496 [doi]
AB  - People living in endemic areas often habour several malaria infections at once.
      High-resolution genotyping can distinguish between infections by detecting the
      presence of different alleles at a polymorphic locus. However the number of
      infections may not be accurately counted since parasites from multiple infections
      may carry the same allele. We use simulation to determine the circumstances under
      which the number of observed genotypes are likely to be substantially less than
      the number of infections present and investigate the performance of two methods
      for estimating the numbers of infections from high-resolution genotyping data.
      The simulations suggest that the problem is not substantial in most datasets: the
      disparity between the mean numbers of infections and of observed genotypes was
      small when there was 20 or more alleles, 20 or more blood samples, a mean number 
      of infections of 6 or less and where the frequency of the most common allele was 
      no greater than 20%. The issue of multiple infections carrying the same allele is
      unlikely to be a major component of the errors in PCR-based genotyping.
      Simulations also showed that, with heterogeneity in allele frequencies, the
      observed frequencies are not a good approximation of the true allele frequencies.
      The first method that we proposed to estimate the numbers of infections assumes
      that they are a good approximation and hence did poorly in the presence of
      heterogeneity. In contrast, the second method by Li et al estimates both the
      numbers of infections and the true allele frequencies simultaneously and produced
      accurate estimates of the mean number of infections.

PG  - 306
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria and HIV co-infection adversely impact the outcome of both
      diseases and previous studies have mostly focused on falciparum malaria.
      Plasmodium vivax contributes to almost half of the malaria cases in India, but
      the disease burden of HIV and P. vivax co-infection is unclear. METHODS:
      HIV-infected subjects (n=460) were randomly selected from the 4,611 individuals
      seen at a Voluntary Counseling and Testing Center in Chennai, India between Jan 2
      to Dec 31 2008. Malaria testing was performed on stored plasma samples by nested 
      PCR using both genus-specific and species-specific primers and
      immunochromatography-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting antibodies against
      Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. RESULTS: Recent malaria co-infection, defined
      by the presence of antibodies, was detected in 9.8% (45/460) participants.
      Plasmodium vivax accounted for majority of the infections (60%) followed by P.
      falciparum (27%) and mixed infections (13%). Individuals with HIV and malaria
      co-infection were more likely to be men (p=0.01). Between those with and without 
      malaria, there was no difference in age (p=0.14), CD4+ T-cell counts (p=0.19) or 
      proportion CD4+ T-cell below 200/mL (p=0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective testing 
      of stored plasma samples for malaria antibodies can facilitate identification of 
      populations with high rates of co-infection, and in this southern India
      HIV-infected cohort there was a considerable burden of malaria co-infection,
      predominantly due to P. vivax. However, the rate of P. falciparum infection was
      more than 6-fold higher among HIV-infected individuals than what would be
      expected in the general population in the region. Interestingly, individuals
      co-infected with malaria and HIV were not more likely to be immunosuppressed than
      individuals with HIV infection alone.

TI  - Assessment of the molecular marker of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine
      resistance (Pfcrt) in Senegal after several years of chloroquine withdrawal.
PG  - 640-5
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0709 [doi]
AB  - As a result of widespread antimalarial drug resistance, all African countries
      with endemic malaria have, in recent years, changed their malaria treatment
      policy. In Senegal, the health authorities changed from chloroquine (CQ) to a
      combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) in 2003.
      Since 2006, the artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) artemether-lumefantrine 
      (AL) and artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS/AQ) were adopted for uncomplicated
      malaria treatment. After several years of CQ withdrawal, the current study wished
      to determine the level of CQ resistance at the molecular level in selected sites 
      in Senegal, because the scientific community is interested in using CQ again.
      Finger prick blood samples were collected from Plasmodium falciparum-positive
      children below the age of 10 years (N = 474) during cross-sectional surveys
      conducted in two study sites in Senegal with different malaria transmission
      levels. One site is in central Senegal, and the other site is in the southern
      part of the country. All samples were analyzed for single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter gene (Pfcrt; 
      codons 72-76) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence-specific
      oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
      real-time PCR methods. In total, the 72- to 76-codon region of Pfcrt was
      amplified in 449 blood samples (94.7%; 285 and 164 samples from the central and
      southern sites of Senegal, respectively). In both study areas, the prevalence of 
      the Pfcrt wild-type single CVMNK haplotype was very high; in central Senegal, the
      prevalence was 70.5% in 2009 and 74.8% in 2010, and in southern Senegal, the
      prevalence was 65.4% in 2010 and 71.0% in 2011. Comparing data with older studies
      in Senegal, a sharp decline in the mutant type Pfcrt prevalence is evident: from 
      65%, 64%, and 59.5% in samples collected from various sites in 2000, 2001, and
      2004 to approximately 30% in our study. A similar decrease in mutant type
      prevalence is noted in other neighboring countries. With the continued
      development of increased CQ susceptibility in many African countries, it may be
      possible to reintroduce CQ in the near future in a drug combination; it could
      possibly be given to non-vulnerable groups, but it demands close monitoring of
      possible reemergence of CQ resistance development.

      diagnostic test for detection of symptomatic malaria infections.
PG  - 295
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-295 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, IMACCESS(R) developed a new malaria test (VIKIA Malaria Ag 
      Pf/Pan), based on the detection of falciparum malaria (HRP-2) and non-falciparum 
      malaria (aldolase). METHODS: The performance of this new malaria rapid diagnostic
      test (RDT) was assessed using 1,000 febrile patients seeking malaria treatment in
      four health centres in Cambodia from August to December 2011. The results of the 
      VIKIA Malaria Ag Pf/Pan were compared with those obtained by microscopy, the
      CareStart Malaria RDT (AccessBio(R)) which is currently used in Cambodia, and
      real-time PCR (as "gold standard"). RESULTS: The best performances of the VIKIA
      Malaria Ag Pf/Pan test for detection of both Plasmodium falciparum and non-P.
      falciparum were with 20-30 min reading times (sensitivity of 93.4% for P.
      falciparum and 82.8% for non-P. falciparum and specificity of 98.6% for P.
      falciparum and 98.9% for non-P. falciparum) and were similar to those for the
      CareStart Malaria test. CONCLUSIONS: This new RDT performs similarly well as
      other commercially available tests (especially the CareStart Malaria test, used
      as comparator), and conforms to the World Health Organization's recommendations
      for RDT performance. It is a good alternative tool for the diagnosis of malaria
      in endemic areas.

PG  - 76-7
AB  - The gene fragment of PFC0460w was amplified from RNA of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7
      strain with RT-PCR, and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector. The recombinant plasmid
      was transformed into E. coli DH5alpha and the positive clones were selected,
      which were identified by PCR and sequencing. The results showed that there were
      three sequences of PFC0460w fragment, respectively with length of 618, 597 and
      543 bp. The 618 bp fragment was completely consistent with the sequence published
      in PlasmoDB (GenBank No. XM_001351147), and the 597 bp and 543 bp fragments were 
      submitted to GenBank with Accession No. of JF799872 and JF799873, respectively.
      205 amino acids were encoded by the 618 bp fragment, and five kinds of protein
      structure were predicted by Robetta.

TI  - Mass blood survey for malaria: pooling and real-time PCR combined with expert
      microscopy in north-west Thailand.
PG  - 288
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      is common in both low-and high-transmission settings and represents an important 
      reservoir of infection that needs to be targeted if malaria elimination is to
      succeed. METHODS: Mass blood examinations (475 individuals) were conducted in two
      villages in Mae Hong Son, an area of endemic but low-transmission malaria in the 
      north-west of Thailand. The microscopist at the local malaria clinic did not
      detect any infections. Pools of four samples were screened by real-time PCR;
      individual members of all of the positive pools were then re-examined by expert
      microscopy and by a second species-specific PCR reaction. RESULTS: Eight subjects
      were found to be positive by both PCR and expert microscopy and one was found to 
      be positive by PCR alone. The slides contained asexual stage parasites of P.
      vivax, P. falciparum and Plasmodium malariae, but no gametocytes. The local
      clinic was notified within two to eight days of the survey. CONCLUSION: A
      combination of pooling, real-time PCR and expert microscopy provides a feasible
      approach to identifying and treating asymptomatic malaria infections in a timely 
      manner.

      associated with the protection of naturally exposed children against infection.
PG  - 287
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 19 kDa C-terminal region of Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite
      Surface Protein-1 is a known target of naturally acquired humoral immunity and a 
      malaria vaccine candidate. MSP-119 has four predominant haplotypes resulting in
      amino acid changes labelled EKNG, QKNG, QTSR and ETSR. IgG antibodies directed
      against all four variants have been detected, but it is not known if these
      variant specific antibodies are associated with haplotype-specific protection
      from infection. METHODS: Blood samples from 201 healthy Kenyan adults and
      children who participated in a 12-week treatment time-to-infection study were
      evaluated. Venous blood drawn at baseline (week 0) was examined for functional
      and serologic antibodies to MSP-119 and MSP-142 variants. MSP-119 haplotypes were
      detected by a multiplex PCR assay at baseline and weekly throughout the study.
      Generalized linear models controlling for age, baseline MSP-119 haplotype and
      parasite density were used to determine the relationship between infecting P.
      falciparum MSP-119 haplotype and variant-specific antibodies. RESULTS: A total of
      964 infections resulting in 1,533 MSP-119 haplotypes detected were examined. The 
      most common haplotypes were EKNG and QKNG, followed by ETSR and QTSR. Children
      had higher parasite densities, greater complexity of infection (>1 haplotype),
      and more frequent changes in haplotypes over time compared to adults. Infecting
      MSP-119 haplotype at baseline (week 0) had no influence on haplotypes detected
      over the subsequent 11 weeks among children or adults. Children but not adults
      with MSP-119 and some MSP-142 variant antibodies detected by serology at baseline
      had delayed time-to-infection. There was no significant association of
      variant-specific serology or functional antibodies at baseline with infecting
      haplotype at baseline or during 11 weeks of follow up among children or adults.
      CONCLUSIONS: Variant transcending IgG antibodies to MSP-119 are associated with
      protection from infection in children, but not adults. These data suggest that
      inclusion of more than one MSP-119 variant may not be required in a malaria blood
      stage vaccine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-folate (sulphadoxine)-resistant pattern in
      Kolkata, one of the malaria endemic zones of Eastern India. METHODS: At first,
      107 P. falciparum suspected cases were enrolled in this study. Ninety isolates
      (84.11%) of 107 suspected cases were analysed, as they had mono-infection with P.
      falciparum. In vitro susceptibility assays were performed in all 90 isolates.
      Parasitic DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction method and polymerase 
      chain reaction was followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis 
      of different codons of the pfdhps gene (436, 437, 540, 581 and 613). RESULTS:
      Among 90 isolates from Kolkata, dhps mutant isolates at codons 436, 437, 540, 581
      and 613 were found in 53.33%, 67.78%, 46.66%, 15.56% and 45.55%, respectively. In
      vitro sulphadoxine resistance was found in 49 isolates (54.44%). Interestingly we
      found 33 isolates (36.67%) with quadruple AGEAT mutant allele, of which 32
      isolates (96.97%) were highly sulphadoxine resistant (P < 0.01) in vitro.
      CONCLUSION: Our present findings implicate that because of enormous drug
      (sulphfadoxine) pressure, novel AGEAT mutation was highly correlated (P < 0.01)
      with sulphadoxine resistance.

TI  - The baseline distribution of malaria in the initial phase of elimination in
      Sabang Municipality, Aceh Province, Indonesia.
PG  - 291

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sabang Municipality, in Aceh Province, Indonesia, plans to initiate a
      malaria elimination programme in 2013. A baseline survey of the distribution of
      malaria in the municipality was conducted to lay the foundations for an
      evidence-based programme and to assess the island's readiness to begin the
      elimination process. METHODS: The entire population of the municipality was
      screened for malaria infection and G6PD deficiency. Specimens collected included 
      blood slides, blots and tubes for selected households. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
      Samples were collected from 16,229 residents. Microscopic examination of the
      blood smears revealed 12 malaria infections; 10 with Plasmodium falciparum and 2 
      with Plasmodium vivax. To confirm the parasite prevalence, polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) diagnosis was performed on the entire positive cases by microscopy
      and randomized 10% of the microscopically negative blood samples. PCR revealed an
      additional 11 subjects with malaria; one P. falciparum infection from the village
      of Paya Keunekai, and nine P. vivax infections and one mixed P. falciparum/P.
      vivax infection from the village of Batee Shok. The overall slide positivity rate
      was 0.074% (CI 95%: 0.070-0.078) and PCR corrected prevalence 0,590% (CI 95%:
      0.582-0.597). Analysis of 937 blood samples for G6PD deficiency revealed two
      subjects (0.2%) of deficient G6PD. Analysis of several genes of the parasite,
      such as Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, Pfcrt, Pfmsp1, Pfmsp2, Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1 and
      host gene, such as G6PD gene revealed that both P. falciparum and P. vivax
      carried the mutation associated with chloroquine resistance. CONCLUSION:
      Malariometric and host genetic analysis indicated that there is a low prevalence 
      of both malaria and G6PD deficiency in the population of Sabang Municipality.
      Nevertheless, malaria cases were clustered in three rural villages and efforts
      for malaria elimination in Sabang should be particularly focused on those three
      villages.

TI  - Deaths due to Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in Sabah, Malaysia: association with
      reporting as Plasmodium malariae and delayed parenteral artesunate.
PG  - 284
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is recognized as a common
      cause of severe and fatal human malaria in Sabah, Malaysia, but is
      morphologically indistinguishable from and still commonly reported as Plasmodium 
      malariae, despite the paucity of this species in Sabah. Since December 2008 Sabah
      Department of Health has recommended intravenous artesunate and referral to a
      general hospital for all severe malaria cases of any species. This paper reviews 
      all malaria deaths in Sabah subsequent to the introduction of these measures.
      Reporting of malaria deaths in Malaysia is mandatory. METHODS: Details of
      reported malaria deaths during 2010-2011 were reviewed to determine the
      proportion of each Plasmodium species. Demographics, clinical presentations and
      management of severe malaria caused by each species were compared. RESULTS:
      Fourteen malaria deaths were reported, comprising seven Plasmodium falciparum,
      six P. knowlesi and one Plasmodium vivax (all PCR-confirmed). Of the six P.
      knowlesi deaths, five were attributable to knowlesi malaria and one was
      attributable to P. knowlesi-associated enterobacter sepsis. Patients with
      directly attributable P. knowlesi deaths (N = 5) were older than those with P.
      falciparum (median age 51 [IQR 50-65] vs 22 [IQR 9-55] years, p = 0.06).
      Complications in fatal P. knowlesi included respiratory distress (N = 5, 100%),
      hypotension (N = 4, 80%), and renal failure (N = 4, 80%). All patients with P.
      knowlesi were reported as P. malariae by microscopy. Only two of five patients
      with severe knowlesi malaria on presentation received immediate parenteral
      anti-malarial treatment. The patient with P. vivax-associated severe illness did 
      not receive parenteral treatment. In contrast six of seven patients with severe
      falciparum malaria received immediate parenteral treatment. CONCLUSION:
      Plasmodium knowlesi was responsible, either directly or through gram-negative
      bacteraemia, for almost half of malaria deaths in Sabah. Patients with severe
      non-falciparum malaria were less likely to receive immediate parenteral therapy. 
      This highlights the need in Sabah for microscopically diagnosed P. malariae to be
      reported as P. knowlesi to improve recognition and management of this potentially
      fatal species. Clinicians need to be better informed of the potential for severe 
      and fatal malaria from non-falciparum species, and the need to treat all severe
      malaria with immediate intravenous artesunate.

TI  - Development, validation and evaluation of a rapid PCR-nucleic acid lateral flow
      immuno-assay for the detection of Plasmodium and the differentiation between
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
PG  - 279
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular tools are very sensitive and specific and could be an
      alternative for the diagnosis of malaria. The complexity and need for expensive
      equipment may hamper implementation and, therefore, simplifications to current
      protocols are warranted. METHODS: A PCR detecting the different Plasmodium
      species and differentiating between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      was developed and combined with a nucleic acid lateral flow immuno-assay
      (PCR-NALFIA) for amplicon detection. The assay was thoroughly evaluated for the
      analytical sensitivity and specificity in the laboratory, the robustness and
      reproducibility in a ring trial and accuracy and predictive value in a field
      trial. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity and specificity were 0.978 (95% CI:
      0.932-0.994) and 0.980 (95% CI: 0.924-0.997), respectively, and were slightly
      less sensitive for the detection of P. vivax than for P. falciparum. The
      reproducibility tested in three laboratories was very good (k = 0.83). This
      evaluation showed that the PCR machine used could influence the results. Accuracy
      was evaluated in Thailand and compared to expert microscopy and rapid diagnostic 
      tests (RDTs). The overall and P. falciparum-specific sensitivity and specificity 
      was good ranging from 0.86-1 and 0.95-0.98 respectively, compared to microscopy. 
      Plasmodium vivax detection was better than the sensitivity of RDT, but slightly
      less than microscopy performed in this study. CONCLUSION: PCR-NALFIA is a
      sensitive, specific and robust assay able to identify Plasmodium species with
      good accuracy. Extensive testing including a ring trial can identify possible
      bottlenecks before implementation and is therefore essential to perform in
      additon to other evaluations.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria and anti-malarial, drug-resistance marker polymorphisms in
      populations near the China-Myanmar border.
PG  - 278
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-278 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome after
      seven-day artesunate monotherapy for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 
      in Yingjiang County along the China-Myanmar border and investigate genetic
      polymorphisms in the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt),
      multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr),
      dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) and ATPase (pfatp6) genes. METHODS: Patients
      >/= one year of age with fever (axillary temperature >/=37.5 degrees C) or
      history of fever and P. falciparum mono-infection were included. Patients
      received anti-malarial treatment with artesunate (total dose of 16 mg/kg over
      seven days) by directly observed therapy. After a 28-day follow-up, treatment
      efficacy and effectiveness were assessed based on clinical and parasitological
      outcomes. Treatment failure was defined as recrudescence of the original parasite
      and distinguished with new infection confirmed by PCR. Analysis of gene mutation 
      and amplification were performed by nested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS:
      Sixty-five patients were enrolled; 10 withdrew from the study, and six were lost 
      to follow-up. All but two patients demonstrated adequate clinical and
      parasitological response; 12 had detectable parasitaemia on day 3. These two
      patients were confirmed to be new infection by PCR. The efficacy of artesunate
      was 95.9%. The pfcrt mutation in codon 76 was found in all isolates (100%), and
      mutations in codons 71 and 72 were found in 4.8% of parasite isolates. No
      mutation of pfmdr1 (codons 86 or 1246) was found. Among all samples, 5.1% were
      wild type for pfdhfr, whereas the other samples had mutations in four codons (51,
      59, 108 and 164), and mutations in pfdhps (codons 436, 437, 540 and 581) were
      found in all isolates. No samples had mutations in pfatp6 codons 623 or 769, but 
      two new mutations (N683K and R756K) were found in 4.6% and 9.2% of parasite
      isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum infection was
      associated with slow parasite clearance and suspected artemisinin resistance at
      the China-Myanmar border area. The prevalence of pfcrt 76 T and markers for SP
      resistance are still high. It should be strengthened further on parasite
      clearance time or clearance half life to confirm the resistance status, and
      molecular epidemiology should provide complementary information to assess the
      appropriateness of current policies based on artemisinin derivatives.

TI  - Evaluation of dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthetase genotypes
      that confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in Plasmodium falciparum in 
      Haiti.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum infects roughly 30,000
      individuals in Haiti each year. Haiti has used chloroquine (CQ) as a first-line
      treatment for malaria for many years and as a result there are concerns that
      malaria parasites may develop resistance to CQ over time. Therefore it is
      important to prepare for alternative malaria treatment options should CQ
      resistance develop. In many other malaria-endemic regions, antifolates,
      particularly pyrimethamine (PYR) and sulphadoxine (SDX) treatment combination
      (SP), have been used as an alternative when CQ resistance has developed. This
      study evaluated mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and
      dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes that confer PYR and SDX resistance,
      respectively, in P. falciparum to provide baseline data in Haiti. This study is
      the first comprehensive study to examine PYR and SDX resistance genotypes in P.
      falciparum in Haiti. METHODS: DNA was extracted from dried blood spots and
      genotyped for PYR and SDX resistance mutations in P. falciparum using PCR and DNA
      sequencing methods. Sixty-one samples were genotyped for PYR resistance in codons
      51, 59, 108 and 164 of the dhfr gene and 58 samples were genotyped for SDX
      resistance codons 436, 437, 540 of the dhps gene in P. falciparum. RESULTS:
      Thirty-three percent (20/61) of the samples carried a mutation at codon 108
      (S108N) of the dhfr gene. No mutations in dhfr at codons 51, 59, 164 were
      observed in any of the samples. In addition, no mutations were observed in dhps
      at the three codons (436, 437, 540) examined. No significant difference was
      observed between samples collected in urban vs rural sites (Welch's T-test
      p-value = 0.53 and permutations p-value = 0.59). CONCLUSION: This study has shown
      the presence of the S108N mutation in P. falciparum that confers low-level PYR
      resistance in Haiti. However, the absence of SDX resistance mutations suggests
      that SP resistance may not be present in Haiti. These results have important
      implications for ongoing discussions on alternative malaria treatment options in 
      Haiti.

TI  - A novel trafficking pathway in Plasmodium falciparum for the organellar
      localization of glutathione peroxidase-like thioredoxin peroxidase.
PG  - 3872-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08746.x [doi]
AB  - Although common in plants, very few proteins are currently known to be localized 
      to both the plastid and the mitochondrion in Plasmodium falciparum. One such
      protein is P. falciparum glutathione peroxidase-like thioredoxin peroxidase
      (PfTPx(Gl)) which we show, by immunofluorescence imaging and bioinformatics
      predictions, is localized to the apicoplast, the mitochondrion and the cytosol.
      The distribution of PfTPx(Gl) was random in the population, with the protein
      localizing to any one organelle in some parasites and to both in others. It has
      been proposed that targeting to each organelle occurs via independent pathways
      that do not proceed via the Golgi. However, for PfTPx(Gl), both incubation at low
      temperature (15 degrees C) and Brefeldin A treatment reversibly blocked targeting
      to these organelles, suggesting the involvement of a novel trafficking route,
      most probably via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. This idea is further
      supported by the lack of cleavage of the putative N-terminal signal sequence of
      PfTPx(Gl), and this N-terminal extension did not compromise PfTPx(Gl) enzyme
      activity. In the context of evolution, a common pathway for the dual localization
      of a single gene product, such as the primitive endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi
      route, may have been retained as opposed to optimization for individual
      organellar import pathways.

      gametocytes.
PG  - 266
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate sampling of sub-microscopic gametocytes is necessary for
      epidemiological studies to identify the infectious reservoir of Plasmodium
      falciparum. Detection of gametocyte mRNA achieves sensitive detection, but
      requires careful handling of samples. Filter papers can be used for collecting
      RNA samples, but rigorous testing of their capacity to withstand adverse storage 
      conditions has not been fully explored. METHODS: Three gametocyte dilutions:
      10/muL, 1.0/muL and 0.1/muL were spotted onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards,
      FTA Classic Cards and 3MM filter papers that were stored under frozen, cold chain
      or tropical conditions for up to 13 weeks . RNA was extracted, then detected by
      quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) and
      reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Successful gametocyte detection was 
      more frequently observed from the Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card compared to the 
      Whatman FTA Classic Card, by both techniques (p<0.0001). When papers were stored 
      at higher temperatures, a loss in sensitivity was experienced for the FTA Classic
      Card but not the 903 Protein Saver Card or Whatman 3MM filter paper. The
      sensitivity of gametocyte detection was decreased when papers were stored at high
      humidity. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card is
      better for Pfs25 mRNA sampling compared to the Whatman FTA Classic Card, and that
      the Whatman 3MM filter paper may prove to be a satisfactory cheaper option for
      Pfs25 mRNA sampling. When appropriately dried, filter papers provide a useful
      approach to Pfs25 mRNA sampling, especially in settings where storage in
      RNA-protecting buffer is not possible.

AB  - Rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) detect malaria specific antigen(s) in the
      circulation, even when parasites are sequestered in the placenta and not visible 
      by microscopy. However, research on their diagnostic accuracy during pregnancy is
      limited. Pregnant women (n = 418) were screened for malaria during routine
      antenatal care by using two RDTs that detect histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) or
      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with
      antibodies that detect dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase or
      heme-detoxification protein, and compared with real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) and microscopy for evaluation of their diagnostic accuracy.
      Prevalence of malaria infection was high (53% by PCR). The RT-PCR and the HRP2
      RDT detected most cases of malaria during pregnancy, whereas microscopy, the
      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase RDT, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for 
      dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase and heme-detoxification protein
      antibodies did not detect several low-density infections. Therefore, the HRP2 RDT
      could be a useful tool in high-transmission areas for diagnosis of malaria in
      asymptomatic pregnant women.

PG  - 252
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum and HIV-1 infection cause substantial morbidity
      and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing evidence suggests these two
      pathogens interact negatively when infecting the same individual. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study among HIV-1 infected and uninfected populations was
      recruited in Mocuba and Maputo, Mozambique to determine the prevalence of
      sub-clinical malarial parasitaemia using light microscopy and a nested PCR assay.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of sub-clinical P. falciparum parasitaemia was low in
      Maputo, whether determined by microscopy (0.4%) or PCR (1.9%), but substantially 
      higher in Mocuba (7.6 and 14.7%, respectively). Nested PCR detected nearly 70%
      more cases of sub-clinical parasitaemia than microscopy, but differences occur by
      locality. HIV-1 infected persons were more likely to be sub-clinically
      parasitaemic than HIV-1 uninfected individuals recruited from the same geographic
      areas. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole use did not substantially reduce
      sub-clinical parasitaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Dried blood spots are a convenient and
      sensitive technique for detecting sub-clinical infection with P. falciparum by
      nested PCR. Prevalence of P. falciparum is substantially lower in Maputo where
      malaria control programmes have been more active than in the rural town of
      Mocuba. In Mocuba, among those presenting for HIV-1 counseling and testing, the
      prevalence of P. falciparum is substantially higher in those who test positive
      for HIV-1 than those without HIV-1 infection. The clinical implications of
      sub-clinical P. falciparum infection among HIV-1 infected persons warrant
      additional study.

      chloroquine drug resistance, Pahang, Malaysia.
PG  - 251
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a public health problem in Malaysia with chloroquine
      (CQ) being the first-line drug in the treatment policy of uncomplicated malaria. 
      There is a scarcity in information about the magnitude of Plasmodium falciparum
      CQ resistance. This study aims to investigate the presence of single point
      mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) at
      codons 76, 271, 326, 356 and 371 and in P. falciparum multi-drug resistance-1
      gene (pfmdr1) at codons 86 and 1246, as molecular markers of CQ resistance.
      METHODS: A total of 75 P. falciparum blood samples were collected from different 
      districts of Pahang state, Malaysia. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfcrt
      gene (codons 76, 271, 326, 356 and 371) and pfmdr1 gene (codons 86 and 1246) were
      analysed by using mutation-specific nested PCR and restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. RESULTS: Mutations of pfcrt K76T and pfcrt R371I
      were the most prevalent among pfcrt gene mutations reported by this study; 52%
      and 77%, respectively. Other codons of the pfcrt gene and the positions 86 and
      1246 of the pfmdr1 gene were found mostly of wild type. Significant associations 
      of pfcrt K76T, pfcrt N326S and pfcrt I356T mutations with parasitaemia were also 
      reported. CONCLUSION: The high existence of mutant pfcrt T76 may indicate the low
      susceptibility of P. falciparum isolates to CQ in Peninsular Malaysia. The
      findings of this study establish baseline data on the molecular markers of P.
      falciparum CQ resistance, which may help in the surveillance of drug resistance
      in Peninsular Malaysia.

TI  - Various pfcrt and pfmdr1 genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum cocirculate with P.
      malariae, P. ovale spp., and P. vivax in northern Angola.
PG  - 5271-7
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00559-12 [doi]
AB  - Artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria has become widely available
      across Africa. Populations of Plasmodium falciparum that were previously
      dominated by chloroquine (CQ)-resistant genotypes are now under different drug
      selection pressures. P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, and P. ovale wallikeri are
      sympatric with P. falciparum across the continent and are frequently present as
      coinfections. The prevalence of human Plasmodium species was determined by PCR
      using DNA from blood spots collected during a cross-sectional survey in northern 
      Angola. P. falciparum was genotyped at resistance-associated loci in pfcrt and
      pfmdr1 by real-time PCR or by direct sequencing of amplicons. Of the 3,316
      samples collected, 541 (16.3%) contained Plasmodium species infections; 477
      (88.2%) of these were P. falciparum alone, 6.5% were P. falciparum and P.
      malariae together, and 1.1% were P. vivax alone. The majority of the remainder
      (3.7%) harbored P. ovale curtisi or P. ovale wallikeri alone or in combination
      with other species. Of 430 P. falciparum isolates genotyped for pfcrt, 61.6%
      carried the wild-type allele CVMNK at codons 72 to 76, either alone or in
      combination with the resistant allele CVIET. No other pfcrt allele was found.
      Wild-type alleles dominated at codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246 of the pfmdr1
      locus among the sequenced isolates. In contrast to previous studies, P.
      falciparum in the study area comprises an approximately equal mix of genotypes
      associated with CQ sensitivity and with CQ resistance, suggesting either lower
      drug pressure due to poor access to treatment in rural areas or a rapid impact of
      the policy change away from the use of standard monotherapies.

TI  - Diversity of anopheline species and their Plasmodium infection status in rural
      Bandarban, Bangladesh.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh was
      considered hyperendemic for malaria. To better understand the contemporary
      malaria epidemiology and to develop new and innovative control strategies,
      comprehensive epidemiologic studies are ongoing in two endemic unions of
      Bandarban district of CHT. Within these studies entomological surveillance has
      been undertaken to study the role of the existing anopheline species involved in 
      the malaria transmission cycle throughout the year. METHODS: CDC miniature light 
      traps were deployed to collect anopheline mosquitoes from the sleeping room of
      the selected houses each month in a single union (Kuhalong). Molecular
      identification was carried out for available Anopheles species complexes.
      Circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210
      (Pv-210) and Plasmodium vivax-247(Pv-247) were detected by Enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the female anopheline mosquitoes. To confirm
      CSP-ELISA results, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed. RESULTS: A
      total of 2,837 anopheline mosquitoes, of which 2,576 were female, belonging to 20
      species were collected from July 2009-June 2010. Anopheles jeyporiensis was the
      most abundant species (18.9%), followed by An. vagus (16.8%) and An. kochi
      (14.4%). ELISA was performed on 2,467 female mosquitoes of 19 species. 15 (0.6%) 
      female anophelines belonging to eight species were found to be positive for
      Plasmodium infection by CSP-ELISA. Of those, 11 (0.4%) mosquitoes were positive
      for P. falciparum and four (0.2%) for Pv-210. No mosquito was found positive for 
      Pv-247. An. maculatus (2.1%, 2/97) had the highest infection rate followed by An.
      umbrosus (1.7%, 2/115) and An. barbirostris (1.1%, 2/186). Other infected species
      were An. nigerrimus, An. nivipes, An. jeyporiensis, An. kochi, and An. vagus. Out
      of 11 P. falciparum CSP positive samples, seven turned out to be positive by PCR.
      None of the samples positive for Pv-210 was positive by PCR. In terms of
      abundance and incrimination, the results suggest that An. maculatus, An.
      jeyporiensis and An. nivipes play important roles in malaria transmission in
      Kuhalong. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that even in the
      presence of an insecticide impregnated bed-net intervention, a number of
      Anopheles species still play a role in the transmission of malaria. Further
      investigations are required to reveal the detailed biology and insecticide
      resistance patterns of the vector mosquito species in endemic areas in Bangladesh
      in order to assist with the planning and implementation of improved malaria
      control strategies.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of drug resistance markers of Plasmodium falciparum in
      Yunnan Province, China.
PG  - 243
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mutations in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance
      transporter (pfcrt), multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase
      (pfdhfr), dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) and ATPase (pfatp6) genes were
      associated with anti-malaria drug resistance. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the prevalence of polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps and 
      pfatp6 in Yunnan Province. Finger-prick blood samples were collected from
      malaria-positive patients from Yunnan Province in 2009-2010. Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the resistance-related genes were analysed by various
      PCR-based methods. RESULTS: A total of 108 blood samples were collected. Although
      chloroquine has not been used to treat falciparum malaria for nearly 30 years,
      95.3% of the parasites still carried the pfcrt K76T mutation, whereas the
      majority of isolates displayed the wild-type pfmdr1 N86 and D1246 sequences. The 
      molecular level of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in P. falciparum was
      high. The most prevalent mutation was pfdhfr C59R (95.9%), whereas the
      frequencies of the quadruple, triple and double mutants were 22.7%
      (N51I/C59R/S108N/I164L), 51.5% (N51I/C59R/S108N, N51I/C59R/I164L and C59R/S108N/ 
      I164L) and 21.6% (N51I/ C59R, C59R/S108N and C59R/I164L), respectively. A437G (n 
      = 77) and K540E (n = 71) were the most prevalent mutations in pfdhps, and 52.7%
      of the samples were double mutants, among which A437G/K540E was the most common
      double mutation (37/49). Quadruple mutants were found in 28.0% (26/93) of
      samples. A total of 8.6% of isolates (8/93) carried the S436A/A437G/A581G triple 
      mutation. No mutations were found in pfatp6 codons 623 or 769, but another two
      mutations (N683K and R756K) were found in 4.6% (3/97) and 9.2% (6/97) of parasite
      isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a high frequency of
      mutations in pfcrt, pfdhfr and pfdhps associated with CQ and SP resistance in P. 
      falciparum and no mutations linked to artemisinin resistance (pfatp6). Molecular 
      epidemiology should be included in routine surveillance protocols and used to
      provide complementary information to assess the appropriateness of the current
      national anti-malarial drug policy.

      PCR-diagnosed malaria at delivery: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e41123
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0041123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New regimens for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
      (IPTp) against malaria are needed as the effectiveness of the standard two-dose
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) regimen is under threat. Previous trials have
      shown that IPTp with monthly SP benefits HIV-positive primi- and secundigravidae,
      but there is no conclusive evidence of the possible benefits of this regimen to
      HIV-negative women, or to a population comprising of both HIV-positive and
      -negative women of different gravidities. METHODS: This study analyzed 484
      samples collected at delivery as part of a randomized, partially placebo
      controlled clinical trial, conducted in rural Malawi between 2003 and 2007. The
      study included pregnant women regardless of their gravidity or HIV-infection
      status. The participants received SP twice (controls), monthly SP, or monthly SP 
      and two doses of azithromycin (AZI-SP). The main outcome was the prevalence of
      peripheral Plasmodium falciparum malaria at delivery diagnosed with a real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. FINDINGS: Overall prevalence of
      PCR-diagnosed peripheral P. falciparum malaria at delivery was 10.5%. Compared
      with the controls, participants in the monthly SP group had a risk ratio (95% CI)
      of 0.33 (0.17 to 0.64, P<0.001) and those in the AZI-SP group 0.23 (0.11 to 0.48,
      P<0.001) for malaria at delivery. When only HIV-negative participants were
      analyzed, the corresponding figures were 0.26 (0.12 to 0.57, P<0.001) for women
      in the monthly SP group, and 0.24 (0.11 to 0.53, P<0.001) for those in the AZI-SP
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing the frequency of SP
      administration during pregnancy improves the efficacy against malaria at delivery
      among HIV-negative women, as well as a population consisting of both HIV-positive
      and -negative pregnant women of all gravidities, in a setting of relatively low
      but holoendemic malaria transmission, frequent use of bed nets and high SP
      resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, the first-line treatment of uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria has been changed from sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 2006. The objective of this study was to assess
      the effectiveness of AL in Jimma Zone two to three years after its broad
      introduction. METHODS: An open-label, single-arm, 42-day study of AL against
      falciparum malaria was conducted in four areas with moderate transmission in
      Jimma Zone between November 2008 and January 2009 and between August and December
      2009. Patients (one-81 years) with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      mono-infection were consecutively enrolled. Follow-up visits were at day 2, 3, 7,
      28 and 42 or any other day if symptoms reoccurred. Primary and secondary
      endpoints were PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates (molecular
      differentiation between recrudescence and re-infection) on days 28 and 42. Other 
      secondary endpoints were gametocytaemia at day 7 and day 28, parasitaemia at day 
      2 and 3, and re-infection rates at day 28 and day 42. RESULTS: Of 348 enrolled
      patients, 313 and 301 completed follow-up at day 28 and at day 42, respectively. 
      No early treatment failure occurred. For per protocol analysis, PCR-uncorrected
      cure rates at day 28 and 42 were 99.1% (95% CI 98.0-100.0) and 91.1% (95% CI
      87.9-94.3), respectively. PCR-corrected cure rates at day 28 and 42 were 99.4%
      (95% CI 98.5-100.0) and 94.7% (95% CI 92.2-97.2), respectively. PCR-corrected
      cure rate at day 42 for children </= 5 years was 90.6% (95% CI 82.4-98.7) only.
      Adverse events were in general mild to moderate. Incidence of new infections was 
      3.4% during 42 days, no new infections with Plasmodium vivax were observed.
      Microscopically detected gametocytaemia was reduced by 80% between day 0 and day 
      7. CONCLUSION: In general, AL was effective and well tolerated in Jimma Zone,
      Ethiopia. However, the PCR-corrected recrudescence rate per-protocol at day 42
      for children </= 5 years was 9.4%. Therefore, further development should be
      monitored on a regular basis as recommended by WHO.

PG  - 233
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum to commonly used anti-malarial
      drugs, especially chloroquine, is being increasingly documented in India. By
      2007, the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria has been revised to
      recommend artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for all confirmed P.
      falciparum cases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability between dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and
      artesunate plus mefloquine (A + M) drug combinations in the treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in India. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2007, 150
      patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled, randomized
      to DP (101) or A + M (49) and followed up for 63 days as part of an open-label,
      non-inferiority, randomized, phase III multicenter trial in Asia. RESULTS: The
      heterogeneity analysis showed no statistically significant difference between
      India and the other countries involved in the phase III study, for both the
      PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates. As shown at the whole study level, both
      forms of ACT were highly efficacious in India. In fact, in the per protocol
      population, the 63-day cure rates were 100% for A + M and 98.8% for DP. The DP
      combination exerted a significant post-treatment prophylactic effect, and
      compared with A + M a significant reduction in the incidence of new infections
      for DP was observed (respectively 17.1% versus 7.5% of patients experienced new
      infection within follow up). Parasite and fever clearance was rapid in both
      treatment arms (median time to parasite clearance of one day for both groups).
      Both DP and A + M were well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events of
      mild or moderate severity. The frequencies of individual adverse events were
      generally similar between treatments, although the incidence of post treatment
      adverse events was slightly higher in patients who received A + M with respect to
      those treated with DP. CONCLUSION: DP is a new ACT displaying high efficacy and
      safety in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and could
      potentially be considered for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in India. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN

TI  - The PfNF-YB transcription factor is a downstream target of melatonin and cAMP
      signalling in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 145-53

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria and is responsible
      for the majority of deaths worldwide. The mechanism of cell cycle control within 
      intra-erythrocytic stages has been examined as a potential means of a promising
      way to identifying how to stop parasite development in red blood cells. Our group
      determined that melatonin increases parasitemia in P. falciparum and P. chabaudi 
      through a complex signalling cascade. In vertebrates, melatonin controls the
      expression of transcription factors, leading us to postulate rather that the
      indoleamine would affect PfNF-YB expression in human malaria parasites. We show
      here that PfNF-YB transcription factor is highly expressed and colocalized in the
      nucleus in mature parasites during intra-erythrocytic stages, thus suggesting an 
      important role in cell division. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that
      melatonin and cAMP modulate the PfNF-YB transcription factor expression in P.
      falciparum at erythrocytic stages. In addition, PfNF-YB is found to be more
      ubiquitinated in the presence of melatonin. Finally, the proteasome inhibitor
      bortezomib is able to modulate PfNF-YB expression as well. Taken together, our
      dada reinforce the role played by melatonin in the cell cycle control of P.
      falciparum and point this indolamine as a target to develop new antimalarial
      drugs.

TI  - Genetic diversity of expressed Plasmodium falciparum var genes from Tanzanian
      children with severe malaria.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe malaria has been attributed to the expression of a restricted 
      subset of the var multi-gene family, which encodes for Plasmodium falciparum
      erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 mediates cytoadherence and
      sequestration of infected erythrocytes into the post-capillary venules of vital
      organs such as the brain, lung or placenta. var genes are highly diverse and can 
      be classified in three major groups (ups A, B and C) and two intermediate groups 
      (B/A and B/C) based on the genomic location, gene orientation and upstream
      sequences. The genetic diversity of expressed var genes in relation to severity
      of disease in Tanzanian children was analysed. METHODS: Children with defined
      severe (SM) and asymptomatic malaria (AM) were recruited. Full-length var mRNA
      was isolated and reversed transcribed into var cDNA. Subsequently, the DBL and
      N-terminal domains, and up-stream sequences were PCR amplified, cloned and
      sequenced. Sequences derived from SM and AM isolates were compared and analysed. 
      RESULTS: The analysis confirmed that the var family is highly diverse in natural 
      Plasmodium falciparum populations. Sequence diversity of amplified var DBL-1alpha
      and upstream regions showed minimal overlap among isolates, implying that the var
      gene repertoire is vast and most probably indefinite in endemic areas. var
      DBL-1alpha sequences from AM isolates were more diverse with more singletons
      found (p<0.05) than those from SM infections. Furthermore, few var DBL-1alpha
      sequences from SM patients were rare and restricted suggesting that certain
      PfEMP1 variants might induce severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic sequence
      diversity of var genes of P. falciparum isolates from Tanzanian children is large
      and its relationship to disease severity has been studied. Observed differences
      suggest that different var genes might have fundamentally different roles in the 
      host-parasite interaction. Further research is required to examine clear
      disease-associations of var gene subsets in different geographical settings. The 
      importance of very strict clinical definitions and appropriate large control
      groups needs to be emphasized for future studies on disease associations of
      PfEMP1.

      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mali.
PG  - 23-8
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0058 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinins by delayed parasite clearance is
      present in Southeast Asia. Scant data on parasite clearance after artemisinins
      are available from Africa, where transmission is high, burden is greatest, and
      artemisinin use is being scaled up. Children 1-10 years of age with uncomplicated
      malaria were treated with 7 days of artesunate and followed for 28 days. Blood
      smears were done every 8 hours until negative by light microscopy. Results were
      compared with a similar study conducted in the same village in 2002-2004. The
      polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rate was 100%, identical to 2002-2004.
      By 24 hours after treatment initiation, 37.0% of participants had cleared
      parasitemia, compared with 31.9% in 2002-2004 (P = 0.5). The median parasite
      clearance time was 32 hours. Only one participant still had parasites at 48 hours
      and no participant presented parasitemia at 72 hours. Artesunate was highly
      efficacious, with no evidence of delayed parasite clearance. We provide baseline 
      surveillance data for the emergence or dissemination of P. falciparum resistance 
      in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Relationship between genotypes of the Duffy blood groups and malarial infection
      in different ethnic groups of Choco, Colombia.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The negative homozygous condition for the Duffy blood group
      (Fy-/Fy-) confers natural resistance to Plasmodium vivax infection. Studies
      carried out in pursuing this direction in Colombia are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To
      describe the relationship between Duffy genotypes in three ethnic communities of 
      La Italia (Choco) and malarial infection. METHODS: This is a descriptive,
      cross-sectional study in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects with malaria.
      SAMPLE SIZE: Afro-Colombians 73; Amerindian (Embera) 74, and Mestizo, 171. The
      presence of Plasmodium infection was assessed by thick smear and the status of
      the Duffy gene was studied by PCR and RFLP to help identify changes to T-46C and 
      A131G which originate the genotypes T/T, T/C , C/C and G/G, G/A, A/A. RESULTS:
      Infection by Plasmodium was detected in 17% of cases with 62% due to P.
      falciparum and 27% due to P. vivax. Duffy genotypes were significantly associated
      with ethnicity (p= 0.003). Individuals with the C/C, A/A diplotypes were
      exclusively infected by P. falciparum, whereas the other diplotypes were infected
      with either of the species. In the Amerindian and Mestizo populations, the
      frequency of the T-46 allele was 0.90-1.00, among Afro-Colombians this was 0.50, 
      the same as with the C allele and with an absence of heterozygous. At locus 131, 
      the maximum frequency of the G allele was 0.30 in Amerindians and the maximum of 
      the A allele was 0.69 in Afro-Colombians. CONCLUSIONS: In the Amerindian and
      mestizo populations studied, there was a predominance of the allele T-46 (FY+)
      but this was not observed with the P. vivax infection. P. vivax was ruled out in 
      all FY- individuals.

TI  - The efficacy and tolerability of artemisinin-piperaquine (Artequick(R)) versus
      artesunate-amodiaquine (Coarsucam) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium 
      falciparum malaria in south-central Vietnam.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is currently used for first-line treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, limited efficacy and
      tolerability data are available on alternative forms of ACT in Vietnam in case
      there is a reduction in the susceptibility of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. A
      study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two fixed-dose
      formulations of ACT, artemisinin-piperaquine (Artequick(R), ARPQ) and
      artesunate-amodiaquine (Coarsucam, ASAQ) for the treatment of P. falciparum
      malaria in south-central Vietnam. METHODS: A randomized, open-label trial was
      conducted comparing the efficacy of a two-day regimen of ARPQ (~2.8 mg/kg
      artemisinin plus ~17.1 mg/kg of piperaquine per day) and a three-day regimen of
      ASAQ (~4.7 mg/kg of artesunate plus ~12.6 mg/kg of amodiaquine per day) for the
      treatment of children and adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Primary
      efficacy endpoint was day 42, PCR-corrected, parasitological cure rate. Secondary
      endpoints were parasite and fever clearance times and tolerability. RESULTS: Of
      128 patients enrolled, 63 were administered ARPQ and 65 ASAQ. Of the patients who
      completed the 42 days follow-up period or had a recurrence of malaria, 55 were on
      ARPQ (30 children, 25 adults) and 59 were on ASAQ (31 children, 28 adults).
      Recrudescent parasitaemia was PCR-confirmed for one patient in each treatment
      group, with cure rates at day 42 of 98% (95% CI: 88-100) for both forms of ACT.
      The median parasite clearance time was significantly slower in the ARPQ group
      compared with the ASAQ group (48 h vs. 36 h, P<0.001) and fever clearance times
      were shorter in the ASAQ group (12 h vs. 24 h, P=0.07). The two forms of ACT were
      well tolerated with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both forms of ACT were
      highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
      Although the two-day course of ARPQ was equally as effective as the three-day
      course of ASAQ, parasite and fever clearance times were shorter with ASAQ.
      Further studies are warranted in different regions of Vietnam to determine the
      nationwide efficacy of ASAQ. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical 
      Trials Registry Number, ACTRN12609000816257.

AB  - Using the Anopheles gambiae Giles genome as a template, we designed, screened and
      identified 14 novel Exon-Primed Intron-Crossing (EPIC) PCR primer pairs for
      Anopheles pseudopunctipennis Theobald 1901, a major vector of human Plasmodium
      sp. in South America. These primers were designed to target the conserved regions
      flanking consecutive exons of different genes and enabled the amplification of 17
      loci of which nine were polymorphic. Polymorphisms at these loci ranged from two 
      to four alleles. Intron length polymorphism analysis is a useful tool, which will
      allow the study of the population structure of this mosquito species, which
      remains poorly understood.

TI  - Investigation of the Plasmodium falciparum food vacuole through inducible
      expression of the chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT).
PG  - e38781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0038781 [doi]
AB  - Haemoglobin degradation during the erythrocytic life stages is the major function
      of the food vacuole (FV) of Plasmodium falciparum and the target of several
      anti-malarial drugs that interfere with this metabolic pathway, killing the
      parasite. Two multi-spanning food vacuole membrane proteins are known, the
      multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) and Chloroquine Resistance Transporter
      (PfCRT). Both modulate resistance to drugs that act in the food vacuole. To
      investigate the formation and behaviour of the food vacuole membrane we have
      generated inducible GFP fusions of chloroquine sensitive and resistant forms of
      the PfCRT protein. The inducible expression system allowed us to follow
      newly-induced fusion proteins, and corroborated a previous report of a direct
      trafficking route from the ER/Golgi to the food vacuole membrane. These parasites
      also allowed the definition of a food vacuole compartment in ring stage parasites
      well before haemozoin crystals were apparent, as well as the elucidation of
      secondary PfCRT-labelled compartments adjacent to the food vacuole in late stage 
      parasites. We demonstrated that in addition to previously demonstrated Brefeldin 
      A sensitivity, the trafficking of PfCRT is disrupted by Dynasore, a non
      competitive inhibitor of dynamin-mediated vesicle formation. Chloroquine
      sensitivity was not altered in parasites over-expressing chloroquine resistant or
      sensitive forms of the PfCRT fused to GFP, suggesting that the PfCRT does not
      mediate chloroquine transport as a GFP fusion protein.

TI  - Evolution of the pfcrt T76 and pfmdr1 Y86 markers and chloroquine susceptibility 
      8 years after cessation of chloroquine use in Pikine, Senegal.
PG  - 1541-6
AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess the evolution of the in vitro
      chloroquine resistance and also the prevalence of pfcrt T76 and pfmdr1 Y86
      mutations in Pikine from 2000 while chloroquine (CQ) was the first-line treatment
      of malaria to 2009 when artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are in
      use. We genotyped pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP and
      assessed in vitro CQ susceptibility by double-site enzyme-linked pLDH
      immunodetection (DELI) assay in Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected in
      Pikine, Senegal. The proportions of the pfcrt T76 allele in the light of the
      three different treatment policies were 72.4 % before CQ withdrawal (2000 to
      2003), 47.2% while amodiaquine plus Fansidar was the first-line treatment (2004
      to 2005), and 59.5 % since the ACT use was implemented (2006 to 2009). The
      prevalence of pfcrt T76 decreased significantly after CQ was stopped [X (2) =
      6.54, P = 0.01 (2000-2003 versus 2004-2005)] and then slightly since ACTs have
      been implemented [X(2) = 1.12, P = 0.28 (2000-2003 versus 2006-2009)]. There were
      no significant differences on the prevalence of pfmdr1 Y86 throughout the three
      treatment policies. The DELI assay was carried out episodically in 2000 (n = 36),
      2001 (n = 47), and 2009 (n = 37). The mean IC(50)s of the isolates to CQ in 2000 
      versus 2009 and 2001 versus 2009 are significantly different (P < 0.05). The
      Fisher exact test found a significant association between the presence of the
      pfcrt T76 mutant allele and in vitro resistance in 2000/2001 (P = 0.023), while
      in 2009 there were no association between both variables (P = 0.274). Mutant
      pfcrt T76 and pfmdr1 Y86 alleles and in vitro CQ-resistant strains are still
      circulating in Pikine. The official discontinuation of CQ use is not completely
      followed by its total withdrawal from private drug sellers, and the molecule
      still exerts pressure on local P. falciparum populations.

      for the diagnosis of malaria in a reference setting.
PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated CareStart pLDH Malaria, a three-band
      rapid diagnostic test detecting Plasmodium falciparum-specific parasite lactate
      dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH) and pan Plasmodium-specific pLDH (pan-pLDH) in a
      reference setting. METHODS: CareStart pLDH was retrospectively and prospectively 
      assessed with a panel of stored (n=498) and fresh (n=77) blood samples obtained
      in international travelers suspected of malaria. Both panels comprised all four
      Plasmodium species; the retrospective panel comprised also Plasmodium negative
      samples. The reference method was microscopy corrected by PCR. The prospective
      panel was run side-to-side with OptiMAL (Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH) and SDFK60
      (histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2)/pan-pLDH). RESULTS: In the retrospective
      evaluation, overall sensitivity for P. falciparum samples (n=247) was 94.7%,
      reaching 98.7% for parasite densities>1,000/mul. Most false negative results
      occurred among samples with pure gametocytaemia (2/12, 16.7%) and at parasite
      densities </= 100/mul (7/12, 58.3%). None of the Plasmodium negative samples
      (n=96) showed visible test lines. Sensitivities for Plasmodium vivax (n=70),
      Plasmodium ovale (n=69) and Plasmodium malariae (n=16) were 74.3%, 31.9% and
      25.0% respectively. Wrong species identification occurred in 10 (2.5%) samples
      and was mainly due to P. vivax samples reacting with the Pf-pLDH test line.
      Overall, Pf-pLDH test lines showed higher line intensities compared to the
      pan-pLDH lines (67.9% and 23.0% medium and strong line intensities for P.
      falciparum). In the prospective panel (77 Plasmodium-positive samples), CareStart
      pLDH showed higher sensitivities for P. falciparum compared to OptiMAL (p=0.008),
      lower sensitivities for P. falciparum as compare to SDFK60 (although not reaching
      statistical significance, p=0.08) and higher sensitivities for P. ovale compared 
      to both OptiMAL (p=0.03) and SDFK60 (p=0.01). Inter-observer and test
      reproducibility were good to excellent. CONCLUSION: CareStart pLDH performed
      excellent for the detection of P. falciparum, well for P. vivax, but poor for P. 
      ovale and P. malariae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimation of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia can vary with the
      method used and time of sampling. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) on whole
      blood or plasma samples has previously been shown to be more sensitive than thick
      film microscopy. However the efficiencies of each method have not been compared
      using samples obtained from infants less than one year old. METHODS: A multiple
      of statistical approaches were used to compare the performance of qPCR on whole
      blood or plasma to detect the 18 S ribosomal gene of P. falciparum in 548 samples
      from children aged 2.5 or 24 months. Parasite prevalence in matched samples was
      compared using Mcnemar's test and agreement of positive results quantified as
      Kappa scores. Parasite prevalences between different age groups were compared by 
      Fisher's test. Results from analyses by thick film microscopy were also available
      from children at 24 months and their correlation to each qPCR method examined by 
      the Spearman's test. Finally the association of P. falciparum infection with the 
      incidence of multiple malaria episodes from contact to 24 months of age was
      evaluated using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: These analyses showed that
      qPCR from whole blood detected approximately 3-fold more cases of infection than 
      plasma qPCR. Both qPCR methods agreed well with each other although qPCR from
      plasma had a greater agreement with microscopy (96.85%) than did qPCR from blood 
      (69.7%). At 24 months the prevalence of infection detected by all methods was
      associated with anaemia (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here
      demonstrates that low levels of parasitaemia are better detected by qPCR using
      parasite DNA from whole blood than from plasma. However plasma samples provide a 
      viable substitute when parasite smears are unavailable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposing healthy human volunteers to Plasmodium falciparum-infected
      mosquitoes is an accepted tool to evaluate preliminary efficacy of malaria
      vaccines. To accommodate the demand of the malaria vaccine pipeline, controlled
      infections are carried out in an increasing number of centers worldwide. We
      assessed their safety and reproducibility. METHODS: We reviewed safety and
      parasitological data from 128 malaria-naive subjects participating in controlled 
      malaria infection trials conducted at the University of Oxford, UK, and the
      Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands. Results were
      compared to a report from the US Military Malaria Vaccine Program. RESULTS: We
      show that controlled human malaria infection trials are safe and demonstrate a
      consistent safety profile with minor differences in the frequencies of
      arthralgia, fatigue, chills and fever between institutions. But prepatent periods
      show significant variation. Detailed analysis of Q-PCR data reveals highly
      synchronous blood stage parasite growth and multiplication rates. CONCLUSIONS:
      Procedural differences can lead to some variation in safety profile and parasite 
      kinetics between institutions. Further harmonization and standardization of
      protocols will be useful for wider adoption of these cost-effective small-scale
      efficacy trials. Nevertheless, parasite growth rates are highly reproducible,
      illustrating the robustness of controlled infections as a valid tool for malaria 
      vaccine development.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo silencing of plasmodial dhs and eIf-5a genes in a putative, 
      non-canonical RNAi-related pathway.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-12-107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) catalyzes the first step in hypusine
      biosynthesis of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) in Plasmodium
      falciparum. Target evaluation of parasitic DHS has recently been performed with
      CNI-1493, a novel selective pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibitor used in clinical 
      phase II for the treatment of Crohn's disease. CNI-1493 prevented infected mice
      from experimental cerebral malaria by decreasing the levels in hypusinated eIF-5A
      and serum TNF, implicating a link between cytokine signaling and the hypusine
      pathway.Therefore we addressed the question whether either DHS itself or eIF-5A
      is required for the outcome of severe malaria. In a first set of experiments we
      performed an in vitro knockdown of the plasmodial eIF-5A and DHS proteins by RNA 
      interference (RNAi) in 293 T cells. Secondly, transfection of siRNA constructs
      into murine Plasmodium schizonts was performed which, in turn, were used for
      infection. RESULTS: 293 T cells treated with plasmodial DHS- and eIF-5A specific 
      siRNAs or control siRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR to determine endogenous dhs -and
      eIF-5A mRNA levels. The expressed DHS-shRNA and EIF-5A-shRNA clearly
      downregulated the corresponding transcript in these cells. Interestingly, mice
      infected with transgenic schizonts expressing either the eIF-5A or dhs shRNA
      showed an elevated parasitemia within the first two days post infection which
      then decreased intermittently. These results were obtained without drug
      selection. Blood samples, which were taken from the infected mice at day 5 post
      infection with either the expressed EIF-5A-shRNA or the DHS-shRNA were analyzed
      by RT-PCR and Western blot techniques, demonstrating the absence of either the
      hypusinated form of eIF-5A or DHS. CONCLUSIONS: Infection of NMRI mice with
      schizonts from the lethal P. berghei ANKA wildtype strain transgenic for
      plasmodial eIF-5A-specific shRNA or DHS-specific shRNA resulted in low
      parasitemia 2-9 days post infection before animals succumbed to hyperparasitemia 
      similar to infections with the related but non-lethal phenotype P. berghei strain
      NK65. RT-PCR and Western blot experiments performed with blood from the
      transfected erythrocytic stages showed that both genes are important for the
      proliferation of the parasite. Moreover, these experiments clearly demonstrate
      that the hypusine pathway in Plasmodium is linked to human iNos induction.

      anti-Plasmodium action.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002737 [doi]
AB  - The Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, an
      etiological agent of human malaria, has been identified as a source of potential 
      anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to be exploited in efforts to control the
      malaria transmission cycle. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved
      immune signaling pathway that has potent anti-P. falciparum activity. Silencing
      the expression of caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or
      over-expressing rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NFkappaB transcription factor,
      confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes that involves an array of 
      immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this powerful mechanism
      that may be essential for the implementation of a malaria control strategy still 
      remain. Using RNA interference to singly or dually silence caspar and other
      components of the Imd pathway, we have identified genes participating in the
      anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, each of which represents a 
      potential target to achieve over-activation of the pathway. We also determined
      that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, yet
      also has reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against
      late oocysts. We further demonstrated that caspar silencing alone is sufficient
      to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response even in the relative absence of
      resident gut microbiota. Finally, we established the relevance of the Imd pathway
      components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 in parasite infection
      intensity-dependent defense, thereby shedding light on the relevance of
      laboratory versus natural infection intensity models. Our results highlight the
      physiological considerations that are integral to a thoughtful implementation of 
      Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae as part of an effort to limit the malaria 
      transmission cycle, and they reveal a variety of previously unrecognized nuances 
      in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum.

AB  - Plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase, key enzyme of anaerobic glycolysis, has been
      shown to be a potential immunodiagnostic marker as well as a novel target for
      chemotherapy. We have cloned, overexpressed and immunochemically characterized
      the recombinant lactate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium knowlesi, the fifth human
      malaria parasite. The P. knowlesi lactate dehydrogenase (PkLDH) gene was PCR
      amplified and 0.9 kb PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Sequencing
      and BLAST analysis revealed open reading frame of 316 amino acids of PkLDH
      showing 96.8% homology with Plasmodium vivax LDH and around 90% with Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale LDHs. The PkLDH gene was
      subcloned into pGEX-6P1 expression vector and the SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that
      about 70% of fusion protein was present in the soluble fraction. The fusion
      protein was cleaved with PreScission protease and recombinant PkLDH (34 kDa) was 
      affinity purified to homogeneity. The purified PkLDH exhibited high reactivity
      with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against plasmodial LDH. The polyclonal 
      antibody produced against purified recombinant PkLDH in rabbits showed high ELISA
      reactivity with both native and recombinant PkLDH and could detect parasite LDH
      in malaria infected blood samples by sandwich ELISA. The purified recombinant
      PkLDH can be used to produce P. knowlesi specific monoclonal antibodies for
      specific diagnosis of P. knowlesi infection in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gametocyte carriage is essential for malaria transmission and
      endemicity of disease; thereby it is a target for malaria control strategies.
      Malaria-infected individuals may harbour gametocytes below the microscopic
      detection threshold that can be detected by reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting gametocyte-specific mRNA. To date, RT-PCR has
      mainly been applied to the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes but
      very limited for that of Plasmodium vivax. METHODS: A multiplex-nested RT-PCR
      targeting Pfs25 and Pvs25 mRNA specific to mature gametocytes of P. falciparum
      and P. vivax, respectively, was developed. The assay was evaluated using blood
      samples collected in rainy and dry seasons from febrile patients,in a
      malaria-endemic area in Thailand. Malaria diagnosis was performed by
      Giemsa-stained blood smears and 18S rRNA PCR. RESULTS: The multiplex-nested
      RT-PCR detected Pfs25 mRNA in 75 of 86 (87.2%) P. falciparum-infected individuals
      and Pvs25 mRNA in 82 of 90 (91.1%) P. vivax malaria patients diagnosed by 18S
      rRNA PCR. Gametocytes were detected in 38 (eight P. falciparum and 30 P. vivax)
      of 157 microscopy positive samples, implying that a large number of patients
      harbour sub-microscopic gametocytaemia. No seasonal differences in gametocyte
      carriage were observed for both malaria species diagnosed by multiplex-nested
      RT-PCR. With single-nested RT-PCR targeting Pfs25 or Pvs25 mRNA as standard, the 
      multiplex-nested RT-PCR offered sensitivities of 97.4% and 98.9% and
      specificities of 100% and 98.8% for diagnosing mature gametocytes of P.
      falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. The minimum detection limit of the
      multiplex-nested PCR was 10 copies of templates. CONCLUSIONS: The
      multiplex-nested RT-PCR developed herein is useful for simultaneous assessment of
      both P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocyte carriage that is prevalent and
      generally sympatric in several malaria-endemic areas outside Africa.

TI  - Change in composition of the Anopheles gambiae complex and its possible
      implications for the transmission of malaria and lymphatic filariasis in
      north-eastern Tanzania.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A dramatic decline in the incidence of malaria due to Plasmodium
      falciparum infection in coastal East Africa has recently been reported to be
      paralleled (or even preceded) by an equally dramatic decline in malaria vector
      density, despite absence of organized vector control. As part of investigations
      into possible causes for the change in vector population density, the present
      study analysed the Anopheles gambiae s.l. sibling species composition in
      north-eastern Tanzania. METHODS: The study was in two parts. The first compared
      current species complex composition in freshly caught An. gambiae s.l. complex
      from three villages to the composition reported from previous studies carried out
      2-4 decades ago in the same villages. The second took advantage of a sample of
      archived dried An. gambiae s.l. complex specimens collected regularly from a
      fourth study village since 2005. Both fresh and archived dried specimens were
      identified to sibling species of the An. gambiae s.l. complex by PCR. The same
      specimens were moreover examined for Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria
      bancrofti infection by PCR. RESULTS: As in earlier studies, An. gambiae s.s.,
      Anopheles merus and Anopheles arabiensis were identified as sibling species found
      in the area. However, both study parts indicated a marked change in sibling
      species composition over time. From being by far the most abundant in the past
      An. gambiae s.s. was now the most rare, whereas An. arabiensis had changed from
      being the most rare to the most common. P. falciparum infection was rarely
      detected in the examined specimens (and only in An. arabiensis) whereas W.
      bancrofti infection was prevalent and detected in all three sibling species.
      CONCLUSION: The study indicates that a major shift in An. gambiae s.l. sibling
      species composition has taken place in the study area in recent years. Combined
      with the earlier reported decline in overall malaria vector density, the study
      suggests that this decline has been most marked for An. gambiae s.s., and least
      for An. arabiensis, leading to current predominance of the latter. Due to
      differences in biology and vectorial capacity of the An. gambiae s.l. complex the
      change in sibling species composition will have important implications for the
      epidemiology and control of malaria and lymphatic filariasis in the study area.

AB  - Malaria transmission was monitored in two villages in the Sahel zone of Niger
      over 4 years. During this period, a nationwide vector control programme was
      carried out in which insecticide-treated bednets were distributed free to mothers
      of children aged <5 years. Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera:
      Culicidae) were found to be the major malaria vectors. The dynamics of An.
      gambiae s.l. did not vary dramatically over the study period although the
      proportion of female mosquitoes found resting indoors decreased in both villages 
      and, in one village, the parity rate and sporozoite index were significantly
      reduced after bednet distribution. By contrast with An. gambiae, the dynamics of 
      Anopheles funestus altered greatly after the bednet distribution period, when
      adult density, endophagous rate and sporozoite rates decreased dramatically. Our 
      observations highlight the importance of quantifying and monitoring the dynamics 
      and infections of malaria vectors during large-scale vector control
      interventions.

TI  - Quantification of multiple infections of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro.
PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human malaria infections caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum
      often contain more than one genetically distinct parasite. Despite this fact,
      nearly all studies of multiple strain P. falciparum infections have been limited 
      to determining relative densities of each parasite within an infection. In light 
      of this, new methods are needed that can quantify the absolute number of
      parasites within a single infection. METHODS: A quantitative PCR (qPCR) method
      was developed to track the dynamic interaction of P. falciparum infections
      containing genetically distinct parasite clones in cultured red blood cells.
      Allele-specific primers were used to generate a standard curve and to quantify
      the absolute concentration of parasite DNA within multi-clonal infections.
      Effects on dynamic growth relationships between parasites under drug pressure
      were examined by treating mixed cultures of drug sensitive and drug resistant
      parasites with the anti-malarial drug chloroquine at different dosing schedules. 
      RESULTS: An absolute quantification method was developed to monitor the dynamics 
      of P. falciparum cultures in vitro. This method allowed for the observation of
      competitive suppression, the reduction of parasites numbers due to the presence
      of another parasite, and competitive release, the improved performance of a
      parasite after the removal of a competitor. These studies demonstrated that the
      presence of two parasites led to the reduction in density of at least one
      parasite. The introduction of drug to a mixed culture containing both a drug
      resistant and drug sensitive parasites resulted in an increased proportion of the
      drug resistant parasite. Moreover, following drug treatment, the resistant
      parasite experienced competitive release by exhibiting a fitness benefit greater 
      than simply surviving drug treatment, due to the removal of competitive
      suppression by the sensitive parasite. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed assay
      allowed for the examination of the dynamics of two distinct clones in vitro; both
      competitive suppression and release were observed. A deeper understanding of the 
      dynamic growth responses of multiple strain P. falciparum infections, with and
      without drug pressure, can improve the understanding of the role of parasite
      interactions in the spread of drug resistant parasites, perhaps suggesting
      different treatment strategies.

TI  - Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein: baseline antibody responses and parasite 
      polymorphisms in a well-consolidated settlement of the Amazon Region.
PG  - 989-1000
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03016.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors associated with the acquisition of
      antibodies against Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) - a leading
      malaria vaccine candidate - in a well-consolidated agricultural settlement of the
      Brazilian Amazon Region and to determine the sequence diversity of the PvDBP
      ligand domain (DBP(II)) within the local malaria parasite population. METHODS:
      Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were collected from 541 volunteers
      using a structured questionnaire. Malaria parasites were detected by conventional
      microscopy and PCR, and blood collection was used for antibody assays and
      molecular characterisation of DBP(II). RESULTS: The frequency of malaria
      infection was 7% (6% for P. vivax and 1% for P. falciparum), with malaria cases
      clustered near mosquito breeding sites. Nearly 50% of settlers had anti-PvDBP IgG
      antibodies, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with
      subject's age being the only strong predictor of seropositivity to PvDBP.
      Unexpectedly, low levels of DBP(II) diversity were found within the local malaria
      parasites, suggesting the existence of low gene flow between P. vivax
      populations, probably due to the relative isolation of the studied settlement.
      CONCLUSION: The recognition of PvDBP by a significant proportion of the
      community, associated with low levels of DBP(II) diversity among local P. vivax, 
      reinforces the variety of malaria transmission patterns in communities from
      frontier settlements. Such studies should provide baseline information for
      antimalarial vaccines now in development.

TI  - Changes in genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum human malaria parasite following
      withdrawal of chloroquine in Tiwi, Kenya.
PG  - 202-7
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.05.007 [doi]
AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) drug was withdrawn in 1998 as a first-line treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in Kenya. This was in response to resistance to the drug in
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite. Investigations were conducted to
      determine prevalence of CQ resistance genotypes in the parasites in Tiwi, a
      malaria endemic town in Kenya, before and about a decade after the withdrawal of 
      the drug. Blood samples were collected and spotted on filter papers in 1999 and
      2008 from 75 and 77 out-patients respectively with uncomplicated malaria. The
      sampling was conducted using finger pricking technique. DNA was extracted from
      individual spots in the papers and screened for the presence of P. falciparum
      chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) and multi drug resistance (Pfmdr-1)
      markers using nested PCR. Nature of mutations (haplotypes) in the Pfcrt and
      Pfmdr-1 markers in the samples were confirmed using dot blot hybridization
      technique. Changes in pattern of CQ resistance in the parasite samples in 1999
      and 2008 were assessed by Chi Square test. There was a significant (P<0.05)
      reduction in CQ resistant genotypes of the parasite between 1999 and 2008. Pfmdr 
      and Pfcrt CQ resistant genotypes in 2008 reduced to 54.10 and 63.64%
      respectively, from 75.39 and 88.0% respectively in 1999. This reduction was
      accompanied by emergence of Pfcrt specific CQ sensitive (IEK) and
      intermediate/partially CQ resistant (MET) haplotypes. Results suggest significant
      reversal of the phenotype of the parasite from chloroquine resistant to
      wild/sensitive type. The novel haplotypes indicates transitional phase of the
      parasite to the wild type. Current prevalence of chloroquine resistant genotype
      is definitely above the threshold for efficacious re-introduction of chloroquine 
      for treatment of malaria in Tiwi.

TI  - Efficacy of fixed-dose combination artesunate-amodiaquine versus
      artemether-lumefantrine for uncomplicated childhood Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      in Democratic Republic of Congo: a randomized non-inferiority trial.
PG  - 174
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2005, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) adopted artesunate
      and amodiaquine (ASAQ) as first-line anti-malarial treatment. In order to compare
      the efficacy of the fixed-dose formulation ASAQ versus artemether-lumefantrine
      (AL), a randomized, non-inferiority open-label trial was conducted in Katanga.
      METHODS: Children aged six and 59 months with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria were enrolled and randomly allocated into one of the two regimens. The
      risk of recurrent parasitaemia by day 42, both unadjusted and adjusted by PCR
      genotyping to distinguish recrudescence from new infection, was analysed.
      RESULTS: Between April 2008 and March 2009, 301 children were included: 156 with 
      ASAQ and 145 with AL. No early treatment failures were reported. Among the 256
      patients followed-up at day 42, 32 patients developed late clinical or
      parasitological failure (9.9% (13/131) in the ASAQ group and 15.2% (19/125) in
      the AL group). After PCR correction, cure rates were 98.3% (95%CI, 94.1-99.8) in 
      the ASAQ group and 99.1% (95%CI, 94.9-99.9) in the AL group (difference -0.7%,
      one sided 95% CI -3.1). Kaplan-Meier PCR-adjusted cure rates were similar. Both
      treatment regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Both ASAQ and AL
      are highly effective and currently adequate as the first-line treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in this area of Katanga, DRC. However, in a very
      large country, such as DRC, and because of possible emergence of resistance from 
      other endemic regions, surveillance of efficacy of artemisinin-based combination 
      treatments, including other evaluations of the resistance of ASAQ, need to be
      done in other provinces. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered with the
      clinicaltrials.gov, open clinical trial registry under the identifier number
      NCT01567423.

AB  - Understanding specific gene regulation during responses to malaria infection is
      key to dissecting the mosquito defense mechanisms and host/parasite interactions.
      A full-length serine protease cDNA was isolated from the fat body of female
      Anopheles dirus, a major malaria vector in Thailand. The predicted amino acid
      sequence of SERF4 identifies it as a member of the serine protease family
      containing a single trypsin-like protease domain. Digestive trypsins function in 
      the female mosquito midgut and are inducible in two phases in this tissue upon
      blood intake. However, the gene was highly upregulated in the midgut at day 3
      postinfection by Plasmodium falciparum. In situ hybridization confirmed that
      SERF4 transcripts were located in the midgut epithelial cells rather than
      hemocytes or other tissues associated with the midgut. SERF4 was also strongly
      downregulated in the whole insects at day 16 after infection in comparison with
      the blood-fed control. Changes in the expression of the SERF4 gene in response to
      infection with this human malaria parasite suggest a role in parasite-specific
      innate immunity.

      are associated with severe malaria in children.
PG  - E1791-800
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1120455109 [doi]
AB  - The clinical outcome of Plasmodium falciparum infections ranges from asymptomatic
      parasitemia to severe malaria syndromes associated with high mortality. The
      virulence of P. falciparum infections is associated with the type of P.
      falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed on the surface of
      infected erythrocytes to anchor these to the vascular lining. Although var2csa,
      the var gene encoding the PfEMP1 associated with placental malaria, was
      discovered in 2003, the identification of the var/PfEMP1 variants associated with
      severe malaria in children has remained elusive. To identify var/PfEMP1 variants 
      associated with severe disease outcome, we compared var transcript levels in
      parasites from 88 children with severe malaria and 40 children admitted to the
      hospital with uncomplicated malaria. Transcript analysis was performed by
      RT-quantitative PCR using a set of 42 primer pairs amplifying var
      subtype-specific loci covering most var/PfEMP1 subtypes. In addition, we
      characterized the near-full-length sequence of the most prominently expressed var
      genes in three patients diagnosed with severe anemia and/or cerebral malaria. The
      combined analysis showed that severe malaria syndromes, including severe anemia
      and cerebral malaria, are associated with high transcript levels of PfEMP1 domain
      cassette 8-encoding var genes. Transcript levels of group A var genes, including 
      genes encoding domain cassette 13, were also significantly higher in patients
      with severe syndromes compared with those with uncomplicated malaria. This study 
      specifies the var/PfEMP1 types expressed in severe malaria in children, and
      thereby provides unique targets for future efforts to prevent and treat severe
      malaria infections.

      apoptosis and dysfunction in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 333-40
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis366 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells
      that are crucial for initiation of immune responses. During naturally acquired
      malaria, DC number and function is reduced. METHODS: The timing of, parasitemia
      threshold of, and contribution of apoptosis to DC loss were prospectively
      evaluated in 10 men after experimental challenge with approximately 1800
      Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) and after drug cure
      initiated at a parasite level of >/= 1000 parasites/mL. RESULTS: The nadir levels
      of total, myeloid, and plasmacytoid DCs occurred 8 days after infection. DC loss 
      was partially attributable to apoptosis, which was first detected on day 5
      (median parasite level, 238 parasites/mL) and maximal at day 7. Remaining DCs
      exhibited a reduced ability to uptake particulate antigen. DC numbers recovered
      approximately 60 hours after antimalarial drug administration. There was no loss 
      of DC number or function before or after drug cure in 5 men inoculated with <180 
      pRBCs and treated on day 6, when their parasite level was approximately 200
      parasites/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium causes DC loss in vivo, which is at least
      partially explained by apoptosis in response to blood-stage parasites. In primary
      infection, loss of DC number and function occurs early during the prepatent
      period and before or with onset of clinical symptoms. These findings may explain 
      in part the inadequate development of immunity to blood-stage malaria infection.

AB  - The development of a vaccine against malaria has public health priority. In a
      controlled setting, preliminary data on the efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum
      vaccine candidates can be obtained by exposing immunized human volunteers to the 
      bites of laboratory-reared P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. Using empirical
      data, we show that these trials, with small numbers of volunteers, are
      sufficiently powered to detect protective biological effects induced by
      preerythrocytic and/or blood-stage candidate vaccines if parasitemia is measured 
      daily by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Sporozoite challenge trials are 
      thus a powerful tool for early selection of candidates that warrant efficacy of
      trials in the field.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum with reduced sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives has
      been observed in endemic areas, but the molecular mechanisms for this reduced
      sensitivity remain unclear. We evaluated the association between in vitro
      susceptibility of P. falciparum isolates obtained from southwest Nigeria and
      polymorphisms in selected putative transporter genes (PFE0775C, PF13_0271,
      pfmrp1, pfcrt, and pfmdr1). Modified schizont inhibition assay was used to
      determine the in vitro parasite susceptibility to artemether (ATH). Polymorphisms
      in selected genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct
      DNA sequencing. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) geometric mean
      (GM) for all P. falciparum isolates was 1.78 nM (range, 0.03-10.43 nM).
      Polymorphisms at codons 241, 86, and 76 of PFE0775C, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes,
      respectively, were associated with reduced susceptibility to ATH. A new S263P
      single-nucleotide polymorphism on the PFE0775C gene was also detected in 27% of
      the isolates. Patient isolates harboring V241L or S263P polymorphisms on the
      PFE0775C gene showed increased IC(50) (GM: 3.08 nM and 1.79 nM, respectively).
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates harboring mutant Y86 pfmdr1 and P263 PFE0775C
      alleles showed a 2.5-5.5-fold increase in ATH IC(50.) This study shows that
      polymorphisms on the PFE0775C and pfmdr1 genes are associated with reduced
      sensitivity to ATH in fresh isolates of P. falciparum from Nigeria.

TI  - Arterolane maleate plus piperaquine phosphate for treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria: a comparative, multicenter, randomized clinical
      trial.
PG  - 663-71
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first-line treatment for
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This study assessed the antimalarial efficacy
      and safety of a combination of 150 mg of arterolane maleate and 750 mg of
      piperaquine phosphate (AM-PQP) in comparison to Coartem (artemether and
      lumefantrine) in patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
      METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, multicentric, parallel group clinical
      trial, 240 patients were randomized to receive AM-PQP (160 patients) or Coartem
      (80 patients). Patients with P. falciparum monoinfection and initial parasite
      densities ranging from 1000 to 100 000 asexual parasites/microL of blood were
      followed for 28 days. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected adequate clinical and
      parasitologic response on day 28, parasite clearance time, and fever clearance
      time were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 151 (94.4%) of 160 patients in the
      AM-PQP group completed the trial, while 77 (96.3%) of 80 patients in the Coartem 
      group completed the trial. No treatment failure was noted in the AM-PQP group,
      while one patient receiving Coartem failed treatment on day 28. There was no
      difference in the median parasite clearance time (30 hours in both groups) or
      median fever clearance time (24 hours in both groups) after administration of the
      2 study treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The available data support the evaluation of a
      drug combination in a larger population as a fixed-dose combination. Clinical
      Trials Registration. CTRI/2007/091/000031.

TI  - Reduced interferon (IFN)-alpha conditioned by IFNA2 (-173) and IFNA8 (-884)
      haplotypes is associated with enhanced susceptibility to severe malarial anemia
      and longitudinal all-cause mortality.
PG  - 1375-91
LID - 10.1007/s00439-012-1175-1 [doi]
AB  - Severe malarial anemia (SMA) is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and
      mortality in holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission areas. Although
      dysregulation in cytokine production is an important etiology of SMA, the role of
      IFN-alpha in SMA has not been reported. As such, we investigated the relationship
      between IFN-alpha promoter polymorphisms [i.e., IFNA2 (A-173T) and IFNA8
      (T-884A)], SMA, and functional changes in IFN-alpha production in children (n =
      663; <36 months) residing in a holoendemic P. falciparum transmission region of
      Kenya. Children with SMA had lower circulating IFN-alpha than malaria-infected
      children without severe anemia (P = 0.025). Multivariate logistic regression
      analyses revealed that heterozygosity at -884 (TA) was associated with an
      increased risk of SMA [OR 2.80 (95 % CI 1.22-6.43); P = 0.015] and reduced
      IFN-alpha relative to wild type (TT; P = 0.038). Additional analyses demonstrated
      that carriage of the -173T/-884A (TA) haplotype was associated with increased
      susceptibility to SMA [OR 3.98 (95 % CI 1.17-13.52); P = 0.026] and lower
      IFN-alpha (P = 0.031). Follow-up of these children for 36 months revealed that
      carriers of TA haplotype had greater all-cause mortality than non-carriers (P <
      0.001). Generation of reporter constructs showed that the IFNA8 wild-type -884TT 
      exhibited higher levels of luciferase expression than the variant alleles (P <
      0.001). Analyses of malaria-associated inflammatory mediators demonstrated that
      carriers of TA haplotype had altered production of IL-1beta, MIG, and IL-13
      compared to non-carriers (P < 0.050). Thus, variation at IFNA2 -173 and IFNA8
      -884 conditions reduced IFN-alpha production, and increased susceptibility to SMA
      and mortality.

PG  - 229-33
LID - 10.3343/alm.2012.32.3.229 [doi]
AB  - Malaria, the most common vector-borne parasite infection worldwide, results from 
      infection by Plasmodium species. Approximately 80% of malaria cases are caused by
      P. vivax, which is broadly distributed from tropical to temperate regions; P.
      falciparum is the second most common infectious species. P. malariae and P. ovale
      are responsible for a relatively small proportion of malaria cases. Here, we
      report the case of a 23-yr-old Korean woman who acquired a P. malariae infection 
      while visiting the Republic of Ghana in West Africa for business. She was
      diagnosed with P. malariae malaria on the basis of peripheral blood smear (PBS)
      and species-specific conventional and real-time PCR assays for 18S rRNA. She was 
      treated with hydroxychloroquine, and the resulting PBS examination on day 2
      suggested that negative conversion occurred. At her 1-month follow-up, however,
      both the PBS examination and molecular test for malaria demonstrated recurrent
      parasitemia. We started rescue therapy with mefloquine, and the patient recovered
      successfully. This is an important finding suggesting possible late recrudescence
      of a chloroquine-resistant P. malariae strain identified not only by its
      morphological features, but also by molecular tests.

TI  - Intracellular cholestasis: a rare complication of malaria falciparum infection.
PG  - 35-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ajg.2012.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aside from acute viral hepatitides intracellular cholestasis is seen 
      less often with the use of certain drugs, contrast media, leptospirosis and
      congenital hyperbilirubinaemias. Types of liver injuries complicating malaria
      usually take the form of acute hepatitis or haemolytic anaemias rather than
      cholestasis. We report here a rare presentation where a typical intracellular
      cholestatic picture complicated malaria falciparum in a patient residing in an
      endemic area. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 55 year old bank manager presented with
      malaria fever and deep jaundice for investigations. CBC, LFT, renal function,
      coagulation profile, liver function test, viral hepatitis markers for HBV and HCV
      including PCR, U/S liver, MRI liver, CT brain, full septic screen, thin and thick
      Giemsa-stained blood films and ICT for malaria, leptospira Abs and ANA. RESULTS: 
      Total bilirubin 22 mg/dl, conjugated 19 mg/dl, ALT 49, AST 65, alkaline
      phosphatase 176 (normal), serum albumin 3.5 mg/dl, INR 0.9, urea 98 mg/dl,
      creatinine 2.3 mg/dl, Hb 8.8, platelet 263, WBC 11000, MCV 84, Coomb's test
      negative, haptoglobulin levels: normal, blood culture: negative, HBVDNA and
      HCVRNA: negative, ANA: negative, blood film and ICT for malaria: positive then
      turned negative after artemether treatment, leptospira Abs titres for six species
      including L haeorragiae at days 7, 14 and 60, were: <1/10 negative. Liver U/S
      normal, MRCP: normal and CT brain: normal patient fully recovered with
      anti-malarial agent artemether and short course of renal support
      (haemofiltration). CONCLUSION: In cases of severe intracellular cholestasis
      malaria infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis particularly
      in malaria endemic localities. This rare complication of a common disorder is
      potentially treatable.

      region.
PG  - 764-74
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0433 [doi]
AB  - The present study analyzed the relationship between the genetic diversity of
      Plasmodium falciparum and parasitologic/entomologic indices in the Mount Cameroon
      region by using merozoite surface protein 1 as a genetic marker. Blood samples
      were collected from asymptomatic children from three altitude zones (high,
      intermediate, and low). Parasitologic and entomologic indices were determined by 
      microscopy and landing catch mosquito collection/circumsporozoite
      protein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A total of 142 randomly 
      selected P. falciparum-positive blood samples were genotyped by using a nested
      polymerase chain reaction-based technique. K-1 polymerase chain reaction products
      were also sequenced. As opposed to high altitude, the highest malaria prevalence 
      (70.65%) and entomologic inoculation rate (2.43 infective/bites/night) were
      recorded at a low altitude site. Seven (18.91%), 22 (36.66%), and 19 (42.22%)
      samples from high, intermediate, and low altitudes, respectively, contained
      multiclonal infections. A new K-1 polymorphism was identified. This study shows a
      positive non-linear association between low/intermediate altitude (high malaria
      transmission) and an increase in P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 block 
      2 polymorphisms.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine versus
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in adult patients with uncomplicated malaria: a
      multi-centre study in Indonesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A practical and simple regimen for all malaria species is needed
      towards malaria elimination in Indonesia. It is worth to compare the efficacy and
      safety of a single dose of artemisinin-naphthoquine (AN) with a three-day regimen
      of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), the existing programme drug, in adults
      with uncomplicated symptomatic malaria. METHODS: This is a phase III, randomized,
      open label using sealed envelopes, multi-centre, comparative study between a
      single dose of AN and a three-day dose of DHP in Jayapura and Maumere. The
      modified WHO inclusion and exclusion criteria for efficacy study were used in
      this trial. A total of 401 eligible adult malaria subjects were hospitalized for 
      three days and randomly treated with AN four tablets single dose on day 0 or DHP 
      three to four tablets single daily dose for three days, and followed for 42 days 
      for physical examination, thick and thin smears microscopy, and other necessary
      tests. The efficacy of drug was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      uncorrected and corrected. RESULTS: There were 153 Plasmodium falciparum, 158
      Plasmodium vivax and 90 P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria. Mean of fever clearance
      times were similar, 13.0 +/- 10.3 hours in AN and 11.3 +/- 7.3 hours in DHP
      groups. The mean of parasite clearance times were longer in AN compared with DHP 
      (28.0 +/- 11.7 hours vs 25.5 +/- 12.2 hours, p = 0.04). There were only 12
      PCR-corrected P. falciparum late treatment failures: seven in AN and five in DHP 
      groups. The PCR uncorrected and corrected on day -42 of adequate clinical and
      parasitological responses for treatment of any malaria were 93.7% (95% Cl:
      90.3-97.2) and 96.3% (95% Cl: 93.6-99.0) in AN, 96.3% (95% Cl: 93.5-99.0) and
      97.3% (95% Cl: 95.0-99.6) in DHP groups. Few and mild adverse events were
      reported. All the abnormal haematology and blood chemistry values had no clinical
      abnormality. CONCLUSION: AN and DHP are confirmed very effective, safe and
      tolerate for treatment of any malaria. Both drugs are promising for multiple
      first-line therapy policies in Indonesia.
