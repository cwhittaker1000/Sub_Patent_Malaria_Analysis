TI  - Artemether-Lumefantrine Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Response Are Minimally
      Altered in Pregnant Ugandan Women Treated for Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria.
PG  - 1274-82
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01605-15 [doi]
AB  - Artemether-lumefantrine is a first-line regimen for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
      Previous studies have reported changes in the pharmacokinetics and clinical
      outcomes following treatment with artemether-lumefantrine in pregnant women
      compared to nonpregnant adults; however, the results are inconclusive. We
      conducted a study in rural Uganda to compare the pharmacokinetics of
      artemether-lumefantrine and the treatment responses between 30 pregnant women and
      30 nonpregnant adults with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. All
      participants were uninfected with HIV, treated with a six-dose regimen of
      artemether-lumefantrine, and monitored clinically for 42 days. The
      pharmacokinetics of artemether, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and
      lumefantrine were evaluated for 21 days following treatment. We found no
      significant differences in the overall pharmacokinetics of artemether,
      dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine in a direct comparison of pregnant women to
      nonpregnant adults, except for a statistically significant but small difference
      in the terminal elimination half-lives of both dihydroartemisinin and
      lumefantrine. There were seven PCR-confirmed reinfections (5 pregnant and 2
      nonpregnant participants). The observation of a shorter terminal half-life for
      lumefantrine may have contributed to a higher frequency of reinfection or a
      shorter posttreatment prophylactic period in pregnant women than in nonpregnant
      adults. While the comparable overall pharmacokinetic exposure is reassuring,
      studies are needed to further optimize antimalarial efficacy in pregnant women,
      particularly in high-transmission settings and because of emerging drug
      resistance. (This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration
      no. NCT01717885.).

AB  - The co-existence of dengue and malaria infection in an individual and the primary
      and secondary dengue infection during co-infection were assessed. Over 1 year,
      1980 blood samples were collected from suspected cases of dengue fever and
      analyzed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect dengue infection.
      RDT and microscopic methods were used to detect malaria. Of the 1980 samples,
      only 22 (3.0%) cases were identified as dengue-malaria co-infection cases, out of
      which 13 were male and 9 were female. The highest number of confirmed cases were 
      found during the hot and humid months of September and October (7 cases, 31.8%)
      and within the over 15 years age group. Of the cases of co-infection, dengue
      primary infection (21 cases, 95.5%) was significantly more common than dengue
      secondary infection (1 case, 4.5%) among all of the age groups. There were 12
      cases of Plasmodium falciparum and 10 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection among
      malarial cases. A high prevalence of concurrence of dengue and malaria infection 
      was recorded in this ecosystem. In light of the severity of co-infection and
      overlapping symptoms, a multidimensional diagnostic approach is suggested.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis Coinfection Has No Impact on Plasmodium berghei
      ANKA-Induced Experimental Cerebral Malaria in C57BL/6 Mice.
PG  - 502-10
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01290-15 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of human infection with
      Plasmodium falciparum. The mechanisms predisposing to CM are still not fully
      understood. Proinflammatory immune responses are required for the control of
      blood-stage malaria infection but are also implicated in the pathogenesis of CM. 
      A fine balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses is required
      for parasite clearance without the induction of host pathology. The most accepted
      experimental model to study human CM is Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbANKA)
      infection in C57BL/6 mice that leads to the development of a complex neurological
      syndrome which shares many characteristics with the human disease. We applied
      this model to study the outcome of PbANKA infection in mice previously infected
      with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis.
      Tuberculosis is coendemic with malaria in large regions in the tropics, and
      mycobacteria have been reported to confer some degree of unspecific protection
      against rodent Plasmodium parasites in experimental coinfection models. We found 
      that concomitant M. tuberculosis infection did not change the clinical course of 
      PbANKA-induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice. The
      immunological environments in spleen and brain did not differ between singly
      infected and coinfected animals; instead, the overall cytokine and T cell
      responses in coinfected mice were comparable to those in animals solely infected 
      with PbANKA. Our data suggest that M. tuberculosis coinfection is not able to
      change the outcome of PbANKA-induced disease, most likely because the
      inflammatory response induced by the parasite rapidly dominates in mice
      previously infected with M. tuberculosis.

TI  - [Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of three 2-drug combinations for the
      treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Senegal:
      artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and
      artemether-lumefantrine].
PG  - 45-50
LID - 10.1684/mst.2015.0524 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2006, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have been
      used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Senegal, as
      recommended by WHO. Recently, decreased parasite clearance with artemisinin
      derivatives has been reported in Cambodia and Thailand. The effectiveness of
      artemisinin derivatives in Africa must be monitored. This study was conducted to 
      evaluate the efficacy and the tolerability of three ACT widely used in Senegal.
      METHODS: From October 2010 to February 2011, a descriptive and analytical
      sequential study was conducted in adults and children to evaluate these three
      combinations: artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), and
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ). The study took place at the health posts 
      of Deggo and Pikine and the health center of Guediawaye, in the suburbs of Dakar.
      The primary endpoint was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological 
      response (ACPR) at day 28 (D28); the secondary endpoints included ACPR at D42,
      clearance times for parasites, fever, and gametocytes, and the incidence of
      adverse events. RESULTS: The study included 393 patients: 139 in the AL group,
      130 in the ASAQ group, and 124 in the DHAPQ group. In the intent-to-treat
      population, PCR-corrected ACPR at day 28 was 92.8% in the AL, 89.2% in the ASAQ, 
      and 91.1% in the DHAPQ (p = 0.58) groups, and in the per-protocol population,
      98.4%, 98.3%, and 100% respectively (p = 0.39). At D42, ACPR was 99.2% in the AL,
      and 99.1% in each of the ASAQ and DHAPQ arms (p = 1). No early therapeutic
      failure (ETF) was observed. The combinations were well tolerated, with no serious
      adverse events reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: These
      combinations are still effective and well-tolerated. Continued monitoring is
      nonetheless essential to detect early artemisinin resistance in Africa.

AB  - The association between P. falciparum eba-175, ama-1, and msp-3 polymorphism in
      the pathogenicity of malaria disease was investigated. We therefore compared the 
      prevalence of different alleles between symptomatic and asymptomatic malarial
      children under five years of age living in Burkina Faso. Blood filter papers were
      collected during the 2008 malaria transmission season from 228 symptomatic and
      199 asymptomatic children under five years of age. All patients were living in
      the rural area of Sapone at about 50 km from Ouagadougou, the capital city of
      Burkina Faso. P. falciparum parasite DNA was extracted using QIAGEN kits and the 
      alleles diversity was assessed by a nested PCR. PCR products were then digested
      by restriction enzymes based on already described polymorphic regions of the
      eba-175, ama-1, and msp-3 genes. The individual alleles eba-175_FCR3 and msp-3_K1
      frequencies were statistically higher (p < 0.0001) in the asymptomatic group
      compared to the symptomatic ones. No statistically significant difference was
      noted in the prevalence of ama-1-3D7, ama-1-K1, and ama-1-HB3 genotypes between
      the two groups (p > 0.05). The comparative analysis of P. falciparum genotypes
      indicated that the polymorphism in eba-175 and msp-3 genotypes varied between
      asymptomatic and symptomatic clinical groups and may contribute to the
      pathogenesis of malaria.

TI  - Assessing the impact of next-generation rapid diagnostic tests on Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria elimination strategies.
PG  - S94-101
LID - 10.1038/nature16040 [doi]
AB  - Mass-screen-and-treat and targeted mass-drug-administration strategies are being 
      considered as a means to interrupt transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
      However, the effectiveness of such strategies will depend on the extent to which 
      current and future diagnostics are able to detect those individuals who are
      infectious to mosquitoes. We estimate the relationship between parasite density
      and onward infectivity using sensitive quantitative parasite diagnostics and
      mosquito feeding assays from Burkina Faso. We find that a diagnostic with a lower
      detection limit of 200 parasites per microlitre would detect 55% of the
      infectious reservoir (the combined infectivity to mosquitoes of the whole
      population weighted by how often each individual is bitten) whereas a test with a
      limit of 20 parasites per microlitre would detect 83% and 2 parasites per
      microlitre would detect 95% of the infectious reservoir. Using mathematical
      models, we show that increasing the diagnostic sensitivity from 200 parasites per
      microlitre (equivalent to microscopy or current rapid diagnostic tests) to 2
      parasites per microlitre would increase the number of regions where transmission 
      could be interrupted with a mass-screen-and-treat programme from an entomological
      inoculation rate below 1 to one of up to 4. The higher sensitivity diagnostic
      could reduce the number of treatment rounds required to interrupt transmission in
      areas of lower prevalence. We predict that mass-screen-and-treat with a highly
      sensitive diagnostic is less effective than mass drug administration owing to the
      prophylactic protection provided to uninfected individuals by the latter
      approach. In low-transmission settings such as those in Southeast Asia, we find
      that a diagnostic tool with a sensitivity of 20 parasites per microlitre may be
      sufficient for targeted mass drug administration because this diagnostic is
      predicted to identify a similar village population prevalence compared with that 
      currently detected using polymerase chain reaction if treatment levels are high
      and screening is conducted during the dry season. Along with other factors, such 
      as coverage, choice of drug, timing of the intervention, importation of
      infections, and seasonality, the sensitivity of the diagnostic can play a part in
      increasing the chance of interrupting transmission.

      infections to inform control and elimination strategies.
PG  - S86-93
LID - 10.1038/nature16039 [doi]
AB  - The global burden of malaria has been substantially reduced over the past two
      decades. Future efforts to reduce malaria further will require moving beyond the 
      treatment of clinical infections to targeting malaria transmission more broadly
      in the community. As such, the accurate identification of asymptomatic human
      infections, which can sustain a large proportion of transmission, is becoming a
      vital component of control and elimination programmes. We determined the
      relationship across common diagnostics used to measure malaria prevalence -
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid diagnostic test and microscopy - for the
      detection of Plasmodium falciparum infections in endemic populations based on a
      pooled analysis of cross-sectional data. We included data from more than 170,000 
      individuals comparing the detection by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy, and 
      30,000 for detection by rapid diagnostic test and PCR. The analysis showed that, 
      on average, rapid diagnostic tests detected 41% (95% confidence interval =
      26-66%) of PCR-positive infections. Data for the comparison of rapid diagnostic
      test to PCR detection at high transmission intensity and in adults were sparse.
      Prevalence measured by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy was comparable,
      although rapid diagnostic test detected slightly more infections than microscopy.
      On average, microscopy captured 87% (95% confidence interval = 74-102%) of rapid 
      diagnostic test-positive infections. The extent to which higher rapid diagnostic 
      test detection reflects increased sensitivity, lack of specificity or both, is
      unclear. Once the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the infectious
      reservoir is better defined, future analyses should ideally establish optimal
      detection limits of new diagnostics for use in control and elimination
      strategies.

TI  - Pfcrt Gene in Plasmodium falciparum Field Isolates from Muzaffargarh, Pakistan.
PG  - 204-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of different
      species of Plasmodium and haplotypes of pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum from the
      selected area. METHODS: Overall, 10,372 blood films of suspected malarial
      patients were examined microscopically from rural health center Sinawan, district
      Muzaffargarh, Pakistan from November 2008 to November 2010. P. falciparum
      positive samples (both whole blood and FTA blood spotted cards) were used for DNA
      extraction. Nested PCR was used to amplify the pfcrt (codon 72-76) gene fragment.
      Sequencing was carried out to find the haplotypes in the amplified fragment of
      pfcrt gene. RESULT: Over all slide positivity rate (SPR), P. vivax and P.
      falciparum positivity rate was 21.40 %, 19.37 % and 2.03% respectively. FTA blood
      spotted cards were equally efficient in the blood storage for PCR and sequencing.
      Analysis of sequencing results of pfcrt showed only one type of haplotype
      SagtVMNT (AGTGTAATGAATACA) from codon 72-76 in all samples. CONCLUSION: The
      results show high prevalence of CQ resistance and AQ resistant genes. AQ is not
      recommended to be used as a partner drug in ACT in this locality, so as to ward
      off future catastrophes.

TI  - Haplotypes of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) gene are not associated
      with severe malaria in Tanzania.
PG  - 474
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1007-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was recently identified as a
      key receptor for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 mediating
      sequestration of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in patients suffering from
      severe malaria. Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) inhibits binding of P. falciparum to EPCR in
      vitro and increased levels of sEPCR have been associated with the H3 haplotype of
      the EPCR encoding PROCR gene. It has been hypothesized that elevated sEPCR
      levels, possibly linked to the PROCR H3 genetic variant, may confer protection
      against severe forms of malaria. This study determined the frequencies of PROCR
      haplotypes H1-4 and plasma levels of sEPCR in a Tanzanian study population to
      investigate a possible association with severe malaria. METHODS: Study
      participants were children under 5 years of age admitted at the Korogwe District 
      Hospital (N = 143), and diagnosed as having severe malaria (N = 52; including
      cerebral malaria N = 17), uncomplicated malaria (N = 24), or an infection other
      than malaria (N = 67). In addition, blood samples from 71 children living in
      nearby villages were included. The SNPs defining the haplotypes of PROCR gene
      were determined by post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere
      assay. RESULTS: Individuals carrying at least one H3 allele had significantly
      higher levels of sEPCR than individuals with no H3 alleles (P < 0.001). No
      difference in the frequency of H3 was found between the non-malaria patients,
      malaria patients or the village population (P > 0.1). Plasma levels of sEPCR
      differed between these three groups, with higher sEPCR levels in the village
      population compared to the hospitalized patients (P < 0.001) and higher levels in
      malaria patients compared to non-malaria patients (P = 0.001). However, no
      differences were found in the distribution of H3 (P = 0.2) or levels of sEPCR (P 
      = 0.8) between patients diagnosed with severe and uncomplicated malaria.
      CONCLUSION: Frequencies of SNPs determining PROCR haplotypes were in concordance 
      with other African studies. The PROCR H3 allele was associated with higher levels
      of sEPCR, confirming earlier findings, however, in this Tanzanian population;
      neither PROCR haplotype nor level of sEPCR was associated with severe malaria,
      however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indoor spraying of insecticides and the use of insecticide-treated
      bed nets are key strategies for national malaria vector control in the central
      highlands of Madagascar. During the year 2013, malaria outbreaks were reported by
      the National Malaria Control Programme in the highlands, including the district
      of Ankazobe. METHODS: Entomological trapping was carried out in April and May
      2013 and in March 2014, using human landing catches, collection of mosquitoes
      resting in stables and in houses by oral aspirators, and Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention light traps. Detection of Plasmodium in mosquitoes was
      carried out on head and thorax of anopheline females by ELISA, CSP and PCR
      (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, or Plasmodium
      ovale). Human biting rate (HBR), sporozoite index and entomological infection
      rate (EIR) were calculated for Anopheles funestus, Anopheles arabiensis,
      Anopheles mascarensis, and Anopheles coustani. RESULTS: In Ankazobe district, the
      presence of malaria vectors such as An. funestus, An. arabiensis and An.
      mascarensis was confirmed, and a new and abundant potential vector, An. coustani 
      was detected. Indeed, one individual of An. funestus and two An. coustani were
      detected positive with P. falciparum while one An. mascarensis and four An.
      coustani were positive with P. vivax. For An. coustani, in March 2014, the EIR
      varied from 0.01 infectious bites/person/month (ipm) outdoors to 0.11 ipm
      indoors. For An. funestus, in April 2013, the EIR was 0.13 ipm. The highest HBR
      value was observed for An. coustani, 86.13 ipm outdoors. The highest sporozoite
      rate was also for An. coustani, 9.5 % of An. coustani caught in stable was
      sporozoite positive. CONCLUSION: The implication of An. coustani in malaria
      transmission was not previously mentioned in Madagascar. Its very high abundance 
      and the detection of Plasmodium coupled with an opportunistic feeding behaviour
      in villages with malaria cases supports its role in malaria transmission in
      Madagascar.

      in a small group of Pakistani population.
PG  - 20-3

AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the role of S180L polymorphism in
      modulation of acquisition of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in a small
      group of Pakistani population. A total of 133 individuals including 60 controls
      and 73 patients of malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, were genotyped using
      allele-specific PCR. Ninety-two samples successfully demonstrated the PCR
      amplification results, while forty-one samples could not be genotyped due to
      failure in PCR amplification. The allele frequency for S180L polymorphism was
      deviant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the population under
      observation. Association was found between the observed polymorphism and the
      occurrence of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (p = 0.01). Chances of
      malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum were low in CC genotype carriers in
      comparison to other genotypes (Odds ratio: 0.3016; 95% CI: 0.124-0.729). The
      present findings suggest that S180L polymorphism is important in modulating the
      probability of acquisition of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in
      Pakistani population. The CC genotype plays a protective role in local population
      against this type of malaria.

      study.
PG  - 469
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0982-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin
      combination therapy (ACT) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria. The present study investigated the efficacy and safety of
      fixed dose combination (FDC) of arterolane maleate 37.5 mg and piperaquine
      phosphate (PQP) 187.5 mg dispersible tablets in paediatric patients aged 6 months
      to 12 years. METHODS: Male and female patients aged 6 months to 12 years who were
      confirmed cases of P. falciparum mono-infection with fever or documented history 
      of fever in the previous 24 h were included. The patients were administered FDC
      of arterolane maleate and PQP as single daily doses for three consecutive days
      based on their age. The primary efficacy outcome was proportion of patients with 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological
      response (ACPR) on day 28. Safety was analysed based on adverse events (AE),
      laboratory abnormalities and abnormalities on electrocardiograph. RESULTS: A
      total of 141 eligible paediatric patients received FDC of arterolane maleate and 
      PQP in a 42-day follow-up study. All the enrolled patients (141) were included in
      intention to treat (ITT) and safety analyses, and 126 patients were considered in
      per protocol (PP) population. The PCR-corrected ACPR on day 28 was achieved in
      all patients (100 %; 95 % CI 97.11-100) included in PP population. The median
      parasite clearance time (PCT) and fever clearance time (FCT) were 24 h (95 % CI
      18.0-24.0) and 10 h (95 % CI 4.0-18.0), respectively. The most frequently
      reported clinical AE was vomiting. Majority of the AEs were mild to moderate in
      severity and resolved without sequelae. No patient was discontinued for any QTc
      (corrected QT interval) prolongation. No deaths or serious AEs were reported
      during the study. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study showed that FDC of
      arterolane maleate and PQP effectively cures P. falciparum malaria and attains
      acceptable level of cure by day 28 in paediatric patients. The efficacy and
      safety results observed in children warrants further studies on FDC of arterolane
      maleate and PQP dispersible tablets. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry

TI  - Analysis of nucleosome positioning landscapes enables gene discovery in the human
      malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 1005
LID - 10.1186/s12864-015-2214-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria-causing parasite, has an
      extremely AT-rich (80.7 %) genome. Because of high AT-content, sequence-based
      annotation of genes and functional elements remains challenging. In order to
      better understand the regulatory network controlling gene expression in the
      parasite, a more complete genome annotation as well as analysis tools adapted for
      AT-rich genomes are needed. Recent studies on genome-wide nucleosome positioning 
      in eukaryotes have shown that nucleosome landscapes exhibit regular
      characteristic patterns at the 5'- and 3'-end of protein and non-protein coding
      genes. In addition, nucleosome depleted regions can be found near transcription
      start sites. These unique nucleosome landscape patterns may be exploited for the 
      identification of novel genes. In this paper, we propose a computational approach
      to discover novel putative genes based exclusively on nucleosome positioning data
      in the AT-rich genome of P. falciparum. RESULTS: Using binary classifiers trained
      on nucleosome landscapes at the gene boundaries from two independent nucleosome
      positioning data sets, we were able to detect a total of 231 regions containing
      putative genes in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, of which 67 highly
      confident genes were found in both data sets. Eighty-eight of these 231 newly
      predicted genes exhibited transcription signal in RNA-Seq data, indicative of
      active transcription. In addition, 20 out of 21 selected gene candidates were
      further validated by RT-PCR, and 28 out of the 231 genes showed significant
      matches using BLASTN against an expressed sequence tag (EST) database.
      Furthermore, 108 (47%) out of the 231 putative novel genes overlapped with
      previously identified but unannotated long non-coding RNAs. Collectively, these
      results provide experimental validation for 163 predicted genes (70.6%). Finally,
      73 out of 231 genes were found to be potentially translated based on their signal
      in polysome-associated RNA-Seq representing transcripts that are actively being
      translated. CONCLUSION: Our results clearly indicate that nucleosome positioning 
      data contains sufficient information for novel gene discovery. As distinct
      nucleosome landscapes around genes are found in many other eukaryotic organisms, 
      this methodology could be used to characterize the transcriptome of any organism,
      especially when coupled with other DNA-based gene finding and experimental
      methods (e.g., RNA-Seq).

AB  - The lack of rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostic tests represents the
      primary hurdle affecting malaria surveillance in resource- and expertise-limited 
      areas. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a sensitive, rapid, and
      cheap diagnostic method. Five species-specific LAMP assays were developed based
      on 18S rRNA gene. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP results were calculated as 
      compared with microscopic examination and nested polymerase chain reaction. LAMP 
      reactions were highly sensitive with the detection limit of one copy for
      Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium malariae and 10 copies
      for Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium ovale. LAMP positively detected all human 
      malaria species in all positive samples (N = 134; sensitivity = 100%) within 35
      minutes. All negative samples were not amplified by LAMP (N = 67; specificity =
      100%). LAMP successfully detected two samples with very low parasitemia. LAMP may
      offer a rapid, simple, and reliable test for the diagnosis of malaria in areas
      where malaria is prevalent.

TI  - Methods to Increase the Sensitivity of High Resolution Melting Single Nucleotide 
      Polymorphism Genotyping in Malaria.
PG  - e52839
LID - 10.3791/52839 [doi]
AB  - Despite decades of eradication efforts, malaria remains a global burden. Recent
      renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication has been
      accompanied by increased genomic information about Plasmodium parasite species
      responsible for malaria, including characteristics of geographical populations as
      well as variations associated with reduced susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs.
      One common genetic variation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), offers
      attractive targets for parasite genotyping. These markers are useful not only for
      tracking drug resistance markers but also for tracking parasite populations using
      markers not under drug or other selective pressures. SNP genotyping methods offer
      the ability to track drug resistance as well as to fingerprint individual
      parasites for population surveillance, particularly in response to malaria
      control efforts in regions nearing elimination status. While informative SNPs
      have been identified that are agnostic to specific genotyping technologies,
      high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is particularly suited to field-based
      studies. Compared to standard fluorescent-probe based methods that require
      individual SNPs in a single labeled probe and offer at best 10% sensitivity to
      detect SNPs in samples that contain multiple genomes (polygenomic), HRM offers
      2-5% sensitivity. Modifications to HRM, such as blocked probes and asymmetric
      primer concentrations as well as optimization of amplification annealing
      temperatures to bias PCR towards amplification of the minor allele, further
      increase the sensitivity of HRM. While the sensitivity improvement depends on the
      specific assay, we have increased detection sensitivities to less than 1% of the 
      minor allele. In regions approaching malaria eradication, early detection of
      emerging or imported drug resistance is essential for prompt response. Similarly,
      the ability to detect polygenomic infections and differentiate imported parasite 
      types from cryptic local reservoirs can inform control programs. This manuscript 
      describes modifications to high resolution melting technology that further
      increase its sensitivity to identify polygenomic infections in patient samples.

TI  - High efficacy of two artemisinin-based combinations: artesunate +
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemether-lumefantrine for falciparum malaria in
      Yemen.
PG  - 449
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0970-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) has been the
      first-line treatment and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) the second-line treatment
      for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Yemen since 2005. This paper reports the 
      results of studies conducted to monitor therapeutic efficacy of these two drugs
      in sentinel sites in Yemen. METHODS: Eight therapeutic efficacy studies were
      conducted in six sentinel sites during the period 2009-2013 in Yemen. Five
      studies were for the evaluation of AS + SP (total of 465 patients) and three
      studies (total of 268 patients) for the evaluation of AL. The studies were done
      according to standard WHO protocol 2009 with 28-day follow-up. RESULTS: In the
      evaluation of AS + SP, the PCR-corrected cure rate was 98 % (95 % CI 92.2-99.5 %)
      in one site and 100 % in all of the other four sites. In the sites where AL was
      evaluated, the PCR-corrected cure rate was 100 % in all the sites. All patients
      were negative for asexual parasitaemia on day 3 in both the AS + SP and the AL
      groups. There was a higher rate of clearance of gametocytaemia in the AL-treated 
      group when compared with the AS + SP groups from day 7 onwards. CONCLUSION: AS + 
      SP remains the effective drug for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Yemen. AL
      is also highly effective and can be an appropriate alternative to AS + SP for the
      treatment of falciparum malaria. AL demonstrated a higher efficacy in clearing
      microscopic gametocytaemia than AS + SP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration

TI  - Merozoite surface protein-1 genetic diversity in Plasmodium malariae and
      Plasmodium brasilianum from Brazil.
PG  - 529
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-1238-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) gene encodes the major surface
      antigen of invasive forms of the Plasmodium erythrocytic stages and is considered
      a candidate vaccine antigen against malaria. Due to its polymorphisms, MSP1 is
      also useful for strain discrimination and consists of a good genetic marker.
      Sequence diversity in MSP1 has been analyzed in field isolates of three human
      parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. However, the extent of
      variation in another human parasite, P. malariae, remains unknown. This parasite 
      shows widespread, uneven distribution in tropical and subtropical regions
      throughout South America, Asia, and Africa. Interestingly, it is genetically
      indistinguishable from P. brasilianum, a parasite known to infect New World
      monkeys in Central and South America. METHODS: Specific fragments (1 to 5)
      covering 60 % of the MSP1 gene (mainly the putatively polymorphic regions), were 
      amplified by PCR in isolates of P. malariae and P. brasilianum from different
      geographic origin and hosts. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified products or cloned
      PCR fragments was performed and the sequences were used to construct a
      phylogenetic tree by the maximum likelihood method. Data were computed to give
      insights into the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of these parasites.
      RESULTS: Except for fragment 4, sequences from all other fragments consisted of
      unpublished sequences. The most polymorphic gene region was fragment 2, and in
      samples where this region lacks polymorphism, all other regions are also
      identical. The low variability of the P. malariae msp1 sequences of these
      isolates and the identification of the same haplotype in those collected many
      years apart at different locations is compatible with a low transmission rate. We
      also found greater diversity among P. brasilianum isolates compared with P.
      malariae ones. Lastly, the sequences were segregated according to their
      geographic origins and hosts, showing a strong genetic and geographic structure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that there is a low level of sequence diversity and a 
      possible absence of allelic dimorphism of MSP1 in these parasites as opposed to
      other Plasmodium species. P. brasilianum strains apparently show greater
      divergence in comparison to P. malariae, thus P. malariae could derive from P.
      brasilianum, as it has been proposed.

TI  - Combination of Insecticide Treated Nets and Indoor Residual Spraying in Northern 
      Tanzania Provides Additional Reduction in Vector Population Density and Malaria
      Transmission Rates Compared to Insecticide Treated Nets Alone: A Randomised
      Control Trial.
PG  - e0142671
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0142671 [doi]
AB  - Indoor residual spraying (IRS) combined with insecticide treated nets (ITN) has
      been implemented together in several sub-Saharan countries with inconclusive
      evidence that the combined intervention provides added benefit. The impact on
      malaria transmission was evaluated in a cluster randomised trial comparing two
      rounds of IRS with bendiocarb plus universal coverage ITNs, with ITNs alone in
      northern Tanzania. From April 2011 to December 2012, eight houses in 20 clusters 
      per study arm were sampled monthly for one night with CDC light trap collections.
      Anopheles gambiae s.l. were identified to species using real time PCR Taq Man and
      tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein. ITN
      and IRS coverage was estimated from household surveys. IRS coverage was more than
      85% in two rounds of spraying in January and April 2012. Household coverage with 
      at least one ITN per house was 94.7% after the universal coverage net campaign in
      the baseline year and the proportion of household with all sleeping places
      covered by LLIN was 50.1% decreasing to 39.1% by the end of the intervention
      year. An.gambiae s.s. comprised 80% and An.arabiensis 18.3% of the anopheline
      collection in the baseline year. Mean An.gambiae s.l. density in the ITN+IRS arm 
      was reduced by 84% (95%CI: 56%-94%, p = 0.001) relative to the ITN arm. In the
      stratum of clusters categorised as high anopheline density at baseline EIR was
      lower in the ITN+IRS arm compared to the ITN arm (0.5 versus 5.4 per house per
      month, Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.10, 95%CI: 0.01-0.66, p-value for interaction
      <0.001). This trial provides conclusive evidence that combining carbamate IRS and
      ITNs produces major reduction in Anopheles density and entomological inoculation 
      rate compared to ITN alone in an area of moderate coverage of LLIN and high
      pyrethroid resistance in An.gambiae s.s.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of mixed Plasmodium falciparum-vivax infections in
      French Guiana between 2000 and 2008.
PG  - 446
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0971-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The two main plasmodial species in French Guiana are Plasmodium vivax
      and Plasmodium falciparum whose respective prevalence influences the frequency of
      mixed plasmodial infections. The accuracy of their diagnosis is influenced by the
      sensitivity of the method used, whereas neither microscopy nor rapid diagnostic
      tests allow a satisfactory evaluation of mixed plasmodial infections. METHODS: In
      the present study, the frequency of mixed infections in different part of French 
      Guiana was determined using real time PCR, a sensitive and specific technique.
      RESULTS: From 400 cases of malaria initially diagnosed by microscopy, real time
      PCR showed that 10.75 % of the cases were mixed infections. Their prevalence
      varied considerably between geographical areas. The presence, in equivalent
      proportions, of the two plasmodial species in eastern French Guiana was
      associated with a much higher prevalence of mixed plasmodial infections than in
      western French Guiana, where the majority of the population was Duffy negative
      and thus resistant to vivax malaria. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be more vigilant
      regarding mixed infections in co-endemic P. falciparum/P. vivax areas, in order
      to deliver optimal care for patients suffering from malaria. This may involve the
      use of rapid diagnostic tests capable of detecting mixed infections or low
      density single infections. This is important as French Guiana moves towards
      malaria elimination.

AB  - Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in
      Southeast Asia can have a devastating impact on chemotherapy and control
      measures. In this study, the evolution of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in 
      Thailand was assessed by exploring mutations in the K13 locus believed to confer 
      drug resistance phenotype. P. falciparum-infected blood samples were obtained
      from patients in eight provinces of Thailand over two decades (1991-2014; n =
      904). Analysis of the K13 gene was performed by either sequencing the complete
      coding region (n = 259) or mutation-specific PCR-restriction fragment length
      polymorphism method (n = 645). K13 mutations related to artesunate resistance
      were detected in isolates from Trat province bordering Cambodia in 1991, about 4 
      years preceding widespread deployment of ACT in Thailand and increased in
      frequency over time. Nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity exceeded synonymous
      nucleotide diversity in the propeller region of the K13 gene, supporting the
      hypothesis that this diversity was driven by natural selection. No single mutant 
      appeared to be favoured in every population, and propeller-region mutants were
      rarely observed in linkage with each other in the same haplotype. On the other
      hand, there was a highly significant association between the occurrence of a
      propeller mutant and the insertion of two or three asparagines after residue 139 
      of K13. Whether this insertion plays a compensatory role for deleterious effects 
      of propeller mutants on the function of the K13 protein requires further
      investigation. However, modification of duration of ACT from 2-day to 3-day
      regimens in 2008 throughout the country does not halt the increase in frequency
      of mutants conferring artemisinin resistance phenotype.

TI  - High-level Plasmodium falciparum sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance with the
      concomitant occurrence of septuple haplotype in Tanzania.
PG  - 439
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0977-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tanzania abandoned sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first-line
      treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006 due to high levels Plasmodium
      falciparum resistance. However, SP is still being used for intermittent
      preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP). This study aimed to assess the
      pattern of P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate
      synthetase (Pfdhps) mutations and associated haplotypes in areas with different
      malaria transmission intensities in mainland Tanzania, 6 years after withdrawal
      of SP as a first-line treatment regimen for uncomplicated malaria. METHODS: A
      total of 264 samples were collected during cross-sectional surveys in three
      districts of Muheza, Muleba and Nachingwea in Tanga, Kagera and Lindi regions,
      respectively. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from P. falciparum positive
      samples. The Pfdhfr, Pfdhps single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were amplified
      using nested polymerase chain reaction and detected by sequence specific
      oligonucleotide probe-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (SSOP-ELISA). RESULTS:
      The prevalence of the mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps haplotypes was heterogenous and
      transmission dependent. The triple Pfdhfr mutant haplotypes (CIRNI) were
      predominant in all sites with significantly higher frequencies at Muheza (93.3 %)
      compared to Muleba (75.0 %) and Nachingwea districts (70.6 %), (p < 0.001).
      Overall, the prevalence of the wild-type Pfdhps (SAKAA) haplotype was lowest at
      Muheza (1.3 %), (p = 0.002). Double Pfdhps haplotype SGEAA was significantly high
      at Muheza (27.2 %) and Muleba (20.8 %) while none (0 %) was detected at
      Nachingwea (p < 0.001). The prevalence of triple Pfdhps SGEGA haplotype was
      significantly higher at Muheza compared to Muleba and Nachingwea (p < 0.001). In 
      contrast, Nachingwea and Muleba had significantly higher prevalence of another
      triple Pfdhps AGEAA haplotype (chi(2) = 39.9, p < 0.001). Conversely,
      Pfdhfr-Pfdhps as quintuple and sextuple haplotypes were predominant including the
      emergence of a septuple mutant haplotype CIRNI-AGEGA (n = 11) observed at Muheza 
      and Muleba. CONCLUSION: These results ascertain the high prevalence and
      saturation of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps haplotypes conferring SP resistance in areas with
      changing malaria epidemiology; and this could undermine the use of IPTp-SP in
      improving pregnancy outcomes. In these settings where high level SP resistance is
      documented, additional control efforts are needed and evaluation of an
      alternative drug for IPTp is an urgent priority.

TI  - [Single-tube Single-run Multiplex PCR Detects Mixed Samples with Four Species of 
      Plasmodium].
PG  - 200-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a single-tube single-run multiplex PCR technique that can
      detect single or mixed samples with four species of Plasmodium. METHODS: Folding 
      primers were designed based on the fast nested PCR. The reaction component
      concentrations were optimized and the primers were selected based on the
      annealing temperature. The established single-tube single-run folding-primer
      multiplex PCR (FP-PCR) was tested for its sensitivity and specificity to detect
      single-species and mixed samples with P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale
      (including P. ovale wallikeri) and/or P. malariae. RESULTS: In all the seven
      experimental repeats, FP-PCR successfully detected single-species infection for
      all the four species, with the detection limit reaching or close to 1
      parasite/microl blood. For mixed infections with 2-4 species at different
      densities with the highest being 100 times of the lowest, FP-PCR identified all
      the species in each combination in 57 out of 84 tests. Further, in 10 dried blood
      samples on filter paper from healthy subjects, no FP-PCR amplification was found,
      except weak formation of dimers. CONCLUSION: FP-PCR is a simple and sensitive
      method for detecting both single-species and mixed infections with human
      Plasmodium, and can be applied for malaria diagnosis, screening and monitoring.

TI  - [Usefulness of Immunochromatography Method for Malaria and Dengue Fever
      Diagnosis].
PG  - 19-24
AB  - There are three major differential diagnosis of febrile patients with history of 
      travels to the tropical countries i.e., malaria, typhoid fever and dengue fever. 
      Diagnosis of malaria patients undergoes sometimes arduous process due to the
      variable skills of laboratory technician, and more convenient method is
      warranted. Immunochromatography (IC) method is simple method and recently used
      for diagnosis of several infectious diseases. Here, we reported usefulness of IC 
      method for malaria and dengue fever diagnosis. Forty-seven samples from 46
      patients were retrospectively analyzed by both malaria IC method and microscopic 
      examination. Furthermore, three patients were undergone dengue IC method followed
      by PCR and antibody examination (ELISA) if the results were positive. Several
      factors such as rheumatoid factor (RF) are known to affect the results of IC
      method. We also checked malaria and dengue IC method using serum known to be high
      RF results without malaria infection. Totally six patients were diagnosed as
      malaria i.e., 1 vivax malaria and 5 falciparum malaria. Sensitivity and
      specificity of the malaria IC method were excellent, 100% and 97.6%,
      respectively. Among three patients, one patient revealed false-negative results
      of dengue IC method, however, results of the other two patients revealed good
      correlation between IC method and PCR/ELISA results. Among four RF positive
      serums, 2 malaria IC method and 4 dengue IC method revealed false-positive
      results. In summary, IC method for malaria and dengue fever might be quick and
      convenient method and considered to be used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool.

TI  - Performance of four HRP-2/pLDH combination rapid diagnostic tests and field
      microscopy as screening tests for malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 420
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0943-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy poses a major public health problem in Indonesia
      with an estimated six million pregnancies at risk of Plasmodium falciparum or
      Plasmodium vivax malaria annually. In 2010, Indonesia introduced a screen and
      treat policy for the control of malaria in pregnancy at first antenatal visit
      using microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). A diagnostic study was
      conducted in Sumba, Indonesia to compare the performance of four different RDTs
      in predominately asymptomatic pregnant women under field condition. METHODS:
      Women were screened for malaria at antenatal visits using field microscopy and
      four HRP-2/pLDH combination RDTs (Carestart, First-Response((R)), Parascreen((R))
      and SD-Bioline((R))). The test results were compared with expert microscopy and
      nested PCR. End user experience of the RDTs in the field was assessed by
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall 950 were recruited and 98.7 % were asymptomatic. 
      The prevalence of malaria was 3.0-3.4 % by RDTs, and 3.6, 5.0 and 6.6 % by field 
      microscopy, expert microscopy and PCR, respectively. The geometric-mean parasite 
      density was low (P. falciparum = 418, P. vivax = 147 parasites/microL). Compared 
      with PCR, the overall sensitivity of the RDTs and field microscopy to detect any 
      species was 24.6-31.1 %; specificities were >98.4 %. Relative to PCR,
      First-Response((R)) had the best diagnostic accuracy (any species): sensitivity =
      31.1 %, specificity = 98.9 % and diagnostic odds ratio = 39.0 (DOR). The DOR
      values for Carestart, Parascreen((R)), SD-Bioline((R)), and field microscopy were
      23.4, 23.7, 23.5 and 29.2, respectively. The sensitivity of Pan-pLDH bands to
      detect PCR confirmed P. vivax mono-infection were 8.6-13.0 %. The sensitivity of 
      the HRP-2 band alone to detect PCR confirmed P. falciparum was 10.3-17.9 %.
      Pan-pLDH detected P. falciparum cases undetected by the HRP-2 band resulting in a
      better test performance when both bands were combined. First Response((R)) was
      preferred by end-users for the overall practicality. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic
      accuracy to detect malaria among mostly asymptomatic pregnant women and perceived
      ease of use was slightly better with First-Response((R)), but overall,
      differences between the four RDTs were small and performance comparable to field 
      microscopy. Combination RDTs are a suitable alternative to field microscopy to
      screen for malaria in pregnancy in rural Indonesia. The clinical relevance of low
      density malaria infections detected by PCR, but undetected by RDTs or microscopy 
      needs to be determined.

TI  - Artesunate-amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of acute 
      uncomplicated malaria in Congolese children under 10 years old living in a
      suburban area: a randomized study.
PG  - 423
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0918-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Republic of Congo adopted a new anti-malarial treatment policy in
      2006, with artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the 
      first- and second-line anti-malarial drugs, respectively. Only three clinical
      studies had been conducted before the policy change. A randomized study on these 
      two artemisinin-based combinations was conducted, and the effect that sickle cell
      trait may have on treatment outcomes was evaluated in children under 10 years old
      followed during 12 months in Brazzaville in 2010-2011. METHODS: A cohort of 330
      children under 10 years of age living in a suburban area in the south of
      Brazzaville were passively followed for registration of malaria episodes.
      Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum episodes were randomly treated with
      co-formulated ASAQ (Coarsucam((R))) or AL (Coartem((R))). Patients were followed 
      according to the 2009 World Health Organization protocol for the evaluation of
      anti-malarial drug efficacy. Plasmodium falciparum recrudescent isolates were
      compared to pre-treatment isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
      distinguish between re-infection and recrudescence. PCR-uncorrected and
      PCR-corrected responses to treatment were determined using per protocol analysis.
      Haemoglobin type (AA, AS, SS) was determined by PCR. RESULTS: Of 282 clinical
      malaria episodes registered during 1-year follow-up period, 262 children with
      uncomplicated malaria were treated with ASAQ (129 patients) or AL (133 patients).
      The PCR-corrected efficacy, expressed as the percentage of adequate clinical and 
      parasitological response, was 97.0 % for ASAQ and 96.4 % for AL. Among
      ASAQ-treated patients, 112 (86.8 %) carried AA genotype and 17 (13.2 %) were AS
      carriers. The PCR-corrected efficacy was 96.4 % for AA-carriers and 100 % for
      AS-carriers treated with ASAQ [relative risk (RR) = 0.96; 95 % confidence
      interval, 0.93-1.00, p = 0.5]. Among 133 AL-treated children, 109 (82 %) carried 
      AA, and 24 (18 %) AS genotypes. The PCR-corrected efficacy was 96.7 % among
      AA-carriers and 95.2 % among AS-carriers [RR = 1.01 (0.92-1.12), p = 0.6].
      Nausea, jaundice, headache, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, abdominal pain, and
      diarrhoea were registered as adverse events in both groups. ASAQ was associated
      with significantly more frequent adverse events (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This
      first randomized study in Brazzaville confirmed the excellent efficacy of these
      co-formulated anti-malarial drugs in children. Sickle cell genotype did not
      influence the treatment efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy.

TI  - Use of different transmission metrics to describe malaria epidemiology in the
      highlands of western Kenya.
PG  - 418
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0944-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring and evaluation of malaria programmes may require a
      combination of approaches to detect any effects of control. This is particularly 
      true at lower transmission levels where detecting both infection and exposure to 
      infection will provide additional evidence of any change. This paper describes
      use of three transmission metrics to explore the malaria epidemiology in the
      highlands of western Kenya. METHODS: A malariometric survey was conducted in June
      2009 in two highland districts, Kisii and Rachuonyo South, Nyanza Province, Kenya
      using a cluster design. Enumeration areas were used to sample 46 clusters from
      which 12 compounds were randomly sampled. Individuals provided a finger-blood
      sample to assess malaria infection (rapid diagnostic test, PCR) and exposure
      (anti-Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1 antibodies) and a questionnaire was
      administered to record household factors and assess use of vector control
      interventions. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence infection rates were 3.0 % (95 % CI
      2.2-4.2 %) by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and 8.5 % (95 % CI 7.0-10.4 %) by PCR
      and these ranged from 0-13.1 to 0-14.8 % between clusters for RDT and PCR,
      respectively. Seroprevalence was 36.8 % (95 % CI 33.9-39.8) ranging from 18.6 to 
      65.8 %. Both RDT and PCR prevalences were highest in children aged 5-10 years but
      the proportion of infections that were sub-patent was highest in those between 15
      and 20 years of age (78.1 %, 95 % CI 63.0-93.3 %) and those greater than 20 years
      (73.3 %, 95 % CI 64.5-81.9 %). Those reporting both indoor residual spraying
      (IRS) in their home and use of bed nets had lower exposure to malaria compared to
      those who reported using IRS or bed nets alone. CONCLUSIONS: In this highland
      site in western Kenya malaria transmission was low, but highly heterogeneous. To 
      accurately characterize the true extent of malaria transmission, more sensitive
      and complementary metrics such as PCR or serology are required in addition to the
      standard microscopy and/or RDTs that are routinely used. This is likely to be the
      case in other low endemicity settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of reinfection and resurgence is an integral component of 
      the goal to eradicate malaria. However, the adverse effects of malaria
      resurgences are not known. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection among 1819 Mozambican women who delivered infants between
      2003 and 2012. We used microscopic and histologic examination and a quantitative 
      polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay, as well as flow-cytometric analysis of
      IgG antibody responses against two parasite lines. RESULTS: Positive qPCR tests
      for P. falciparum decreased from 33% in 2003 to 2% in 2010 and increased to 6% in
      2012, with antimalarial IgG antibody responses mirroring these trends. Parasite
      densities in peripheral blood on qPCR assay were higher in 2010-2012 (geometric
      mean [+/-SD], 409+/-1569 genomes per microliter) than in 2003-2005 (44+/-169
      genomes per microliter, P=0.02), as were parasite densities in placental blood on
      histologic assessment (50+/-39% of infected erythrocytes vs. 4+/-6%, P<0.001).
      The malaria-associated reduction in maternal hemoglobin levels was larger in
      2010-2012 (10.1+/-1.8 g per deciliter in infected women vs. 10.9+/-1.7 g per
      deciliter in uninfected women; mean difference, -0.82 g per deciliter; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], -1.39 to -0.25) than in 2003-2005 (10.5+/-1.1 g per
      deciliter vs. 10.6+/-1.5 g per deciliter; difference, -0.12 g per deciliter; 95% 
      CI, -0.67 to 0.43), as was the reduction in birth weight (2863+/-440 g in women
      with past or chronic infections vs. 3070+/-482 g in uninfected women in
      2010-2012; mean difference, -164.5 g; 95% CI, -289.7 to -39.4; and 2994+/-487 g
      vs. 3117+/-455 g in 2003-2005; difference, -44.8 g; 95% CI, -139.1 to 49.5).
      CONCLUSIONS: Antimalarial antibodies were reduced and the adverse consequences of
      P. falciparum infections were increased in pregnant women after 5 years of a
      decline in the prevalence of malaria. (Funded by Malaria Eradication Scientific

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Protective Efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine.
PG  - 2025-2037
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1505819 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine targets the circumsporozoite protein of
      Plasmodium falciparum and has partial protective efficacy against clinical and
      severe malaria disease in infants and children. We investigated whether the
      vaccine efficacy was specific to certain parasite genotypes at the
      circumsporozoite protein locus. METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction-based 
      next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from samples from 4985 participants
      to survey circumsporozoite protein polymorphisms. We evaluated the effect that
      polymorphic positions and haplotypic regions within the circumsporozoite protein 
      had on vaccine efficacy against first episodes of clinical malaria within 1 year 
      after vaccination. RESULTS: In the per-protocol group of 4577
      RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated participants and 2335 control-vaccinated participants who
      were 5 to 17 months of age, the 1-year cumulative vaccine efficacy was 50.3% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 34.6 to 62.3) against clinical malaria in which
      parasites matched the vaccine in the entire circumsporozoite protein C-terminal
      (139 infections), as compared with 33.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 37.2) against
      mismatched malaria (1951 infections) (P=0.04 for differential vaccine efficacy). 
      The vaccine efficacy based on the hazard ratio was 62.7% (95% CI, 51.6 to 71.3)
      against matched infections versus 54.2% (95% CI, 49.9 to 58.1) against mismatched
      infections (P=0.06). In the group of infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, there was no
      evidence of differential allele-specific vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that among children 5 to 17 months of age, the RTS,S vaccine has 
      greater activity against malaria parasites with the matched circumsporozoite
      protein allele than against mismatched malaria. The overall vaccine efficacy in
      this age category will depend on the proportion of matched alleles in the local
      parasite population; in this trial, less than 10% of parasites had matched
      alleles. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

TI  - Impact of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine Resistance on Effectiveness of Intermittent
      Preventive Therapy for Malaria in Pregnancy at Clearing Infections and Preventing
      Low Birth Weight.
PG  - 323-333
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ881 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to increasing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in
      sub-Saharan Africa, monitoring the effectiveness of intermittent preventive
      therapy in pregnancy (IPTp) with SP is crucial. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013,
      both the efficacy of IPTp-SP at clearing existing peripheral malaria infections
      and the effectiveness of IPTp-SP at reducing low birth weight (LBW) were assessed
      among human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected participants in 8 sites in 6
      countries. Sites were classified as high, medium, or low resistance after
      measuring parasite mutations conferring SP resistance. An individual-level
      prospective pooled analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Among 1222 parasitemic
      pregnant women, overall polymerase chain reaction-uncorrected and -corrected
      failure rates by day 42 were 21.3% and 10.0%, respectively (39.7% and 21.1% in
      high-resistance areas; 4.9% and 1.1% in low-resistance areas). Median time to
      recurrence decreased with increasing prevalence of Pfdhps-K540E. Among 6099 women
      at delivery, IPTp-SP was associated with a 22% reduction in the risk of LBW
      (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], .69-.88; P < .001).
      This association was not modified by insecticide-treated net use or gravidity,
      and remained significant in areas with high SP resistance (PR, 0.81; 95% CI,
      .67-.97; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of SP to clear peripheral parasites 
      and prevent new infections during pregnancy is compromised in areas with >90%
      prevalence of Pfdhps-K540E. Nevertheless, in these high-resistance areas, IPTp-SP
      use remains associated with increases in birth weight and maternal hemoglobin.
      The effectiveness of IPTp in eastern and southern Africa is threatened by further
      increases in SP resistance and reinforces the need to evaluate alternative drugs 
      and strategies for the control of malaria in pregnancy.

TI  - Accuracy of an HRP-2/panLDH rapid diagnostic test to detect peripheral and
      placental Plasmodium falciparum infection in Papua New Guinean women with anaemia
      or suspected malaria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of malaria during pregnancy is complicated by placental
      sequestration, asymptomatic infection, and low-density peripheral parasitaemia.
      Where intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is
      threatened by drug resistance, or is inappropriate due to low transmission,
      intermittent screening and treatment (ISTp) with rapid diagnostic tests for
      malaria (RDT) could be a valuable alternative. Therefore, the accuracy of RDTs to
      detect peripheral and placental infection was assessed in a declining
      transmission setting in Papua New Guinea (PNG). METHODS: The performance of a
      combination RDT detecting histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2) and Plasmodium lactate
      dehydrogenase (pLDH), and light microscopy (LM), to diagnose peripheral
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections during pregnancy, were
      assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as the reference standard.
      Participants in a malaria prevention trial in PNG with a haemoglobin </=90 g/L,
      or symptoms suggestive of malaria, were tested. Ability of RDT and LM to detect
      active placental infection on histology was evaluated in some participants.
      RESULTS: Among 876 women, 1162 RDTs were undertaken (anaemia: 854 [73.5 %],
      suspected malaria: 308 [26.5 %]). qPCR detected peripheral infection during 190
      RDT episodes (165 P. falciparum, 19 P. vivax, 6 mixed infections). Overall, RDT
      detected peripheral P. falciparum infection with 45.6 % sensitivity (95 % CI
      38.0-53.4), a specificity of 96.4 % (95.0-97.4), a positive predictive value of
      68.4 % (59.1-76.8), and a negative predictive value of 91.1 % (89.2-92.8). RDT
      performance to detect P. falciparum was inferior to LM, more so amongst anaemic
      women (18.6 vs 45.3 % sensitivity, Liddell's exact test, P < 0.001) compared to
      symptomatic women (72.9 vs 82.4 % sensitivity, P = 0.077). RDT and LM missed 88.0
      % (22/25) and 76.0 % (19/25) of P. vivax infections, respectively. In a subset of
      women tested at delivery and who had placental histology (n = 158) active
      placental infection was present in 19.6 %: all three peripheral blood infection
      detection methods (RDT, LM, qPCR) missed >50 % of these infections. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In PNG, HRP-2/pLDH RDTs may be useful to diagnose peripheral P. falciparum
      infections in symptomatic pregnant women. However, they are not sufficiently
      sensitive for use in intermittent screening amongst asymptomatic (anaemic) women.
      These findings have implications for the management of malaria in pregnancy. The 
      adverse impact of infections undetected by RDT or LM on pregnancy outcomes needs 
      further evaluation.

AB  - Malaria in pregnancy remains a serious public health problem in the Republic of
      Congo despite the implementation of intermittent preventive treatment with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) in 2006. The aim of this cross-sectional
      study was to characterize Plasmodium falciparum infections and determine possible
      risk factors in pregnant Congolese women attending an antenatal clinic in a
      periurban area of southern Brazzaville. This study was conducted from March 2012 
      to December 2013 in a site where several years ago, high malaria resistance to SP
      was reported. Pregnant women were enrolled during antenatal visits and the number
      of received IPTp-SP doses was recorded as well as individual sociodemographic
      data. Peripheral blood was collected and P. falciparum infection was checked by
      microscopy and by PCR targeting P. falciparum merozoite surface protein gene
      (msp2). Haemoglobin concentration was measured and P. falciparum positive samples
      were typed for msp2 allelic diversity. A total of 363 pregnant women were
      recruited. The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection was 7% and 19% 
      by microscopy and by PCR, respectively. More than one half (51.5%) of the
      pregnant women were anaemic. Multivariate analysis indicated that P. falciparum
      infection was associated with anaemia. It was also observed that women who have
      received IPTp-SP have significantly lower prevalence of infection. The
      administration of IPTp-SP did not influence the multiplicity of infection (MOI). 
      This first study investigating asymptomatic malaria infection on pregnant women
      of the Republic of Congo shows that P. falciparum infections were clearly
      associated with maternal anaemia, and use of IPTp-SP reduced the risk of carrying
      asymptomatic infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria, the toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently emerged as
      major player of innate immunity. However, implication of TLR variants on clinical
      manifestations of malaria is conflicting. The present study aims to provide
      relevant information of growing interest in understanding the role of TLR4D299G, 
      TLR9T-1237C and TLR9T-1486C polymorphisms on clinical outcomes of malaria.
      METHODS: We genotyped TLR4D299G, TLR9T-1237C and TLR9T-1486C polymorphisms by
      PCR-RFLP methods and subsequently analyzed in 200 uncomplicated patients and 200 
      severe patients. Further, the severe malaria categorized into sub-clinical groups
      such as cerebral malaria (CM), non-cerebral severe malaria (NCSM), single organ
      dysfunction (SOD) and multi-organ dysfunctions (MODS) are analyzed. RESULT: The
      TLR9-1237CC genotype was observed at significantly low frequency in MODS
      (p=0.0008), while in heterozygous state (TC) it was proportionately more frequent
      in SOD (p=0.087) as compared to mild malaria. The TLR9T-1486C heterozygote was
      more common in all categories of severe malaria. However, pair wise LD analysis
      revealed significant linkage between T-1237C and T-1486C, whereas haplotype
      analysis showed significantly low frequency of C-T haplotype in CM (p=0.005,
      pc=0.02) and high frequency of T-C haplotype in NCSM as compared to mild malaria.
      CONCLUSION: Although TLR9-1237C could be a risk factor for severe malaria in
      heterozygous state, negative association of CC genotype with MODS warrants
      caution of segregating severe malaria into its sub-clinical groups while
      interpreting data. Further, clinical outcome in malaria was observed to be
      apparently modulated by LD between TLR9 promoter variants.

TI  - Significant geographical differences in prevalence of mutations associated with
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax drug resistance in two regions from
      Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 399
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0879-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria treatment and
      control. It can arise and spread rapidly, and vary substantially even at
      sub-national level. National malaria programmes require cost-effective and timely
      ways of characterizing drug-resistance at multiple sites within their countries. 
      METHODS: An improved multiplexed post-PCR ligase detection reaction-fluorescent
      microsphere assay (LDR-FMA) was used to simultaneously determine the presence of 
      mutations in chloroquine resistance transporter (crt), multidrug resistance 1
      (mdr1), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes 
      in Plasmodium falciparum (n = 727) and Plasmodium vivax (n = 574) isolates
      collected in 2006 from cross-sectional community population surveys in two
      geographically distinct regions (Madang and East Sepik) of Papua New Guinea (PNG)
      where strong regional differences in in vivo aminoquinoline and antifolate
      therapeutic efficacy had previously been observed. Data were compared to those of
      a follow-up survey conducted in 2010. RESULTS: Despite some very low parasite
      densities, the assay successfully amplified all P. falciparum and P. vivax loci
      in 77 and 69 % of samples, respectively. In 2006, prevalences of pfdhfr (59R-108 
      N) double mutation/wild type pfdhps haplotype, pfcrt SVMNT haplotype (72S-76T
      double mutation), and 86Y pfmdr1 mutation all exceeded 90 %. For P. vivax, 65 %
      carried at least two pvdhfr mutations, 97 % the 647P pvdhps mutation and 54 % the
      976F pvmdr1 mutation. Prevalence of mutant haplotypes was higher in Madang than
      East Sepik for pfcrt SVMNT (97.4 vs 83.3 %, p = 0.001), pfdhfr (59R-108 N) (100
      vs 90.6 %, p = 0.001), pvdhfr haplotypes (75.8 vs 47.6 %, p = 0.001) and pvmdr1
      976F (71.2 vs 26.2 %, p < 0.001). Data from a subsequent Madang survey in 2010
      showed that the prevalence of pfdhps mutations increased significantly from <5 % 
      to >30 % (p < 0.001) as did the prevalence of pvdhfr mutant haplotypes (from 75.8
      to 97.4 %, p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: This LDR-FMA multiplex platform shows
      feasibility for low-cost, high-throughput, rapid characterization of a broad
      range of drug-resistance markers in low parasitaemia infections. Significant
      geographical differences in mutation prevalence correlate with previous
      genotyping surveys and in vivo trials and may reflect variable drug pressure and 
      differences in health-care access in these two PNG populations.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
      assay targeting the apicoplast genome for malaria diagnosis in a field setting in
      sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - 396
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0926-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New diagnostic tools to detect reliably and rapidly asymptomatic and 
      low-density malaria infections are needed as their treatment could interrupt
      transmission. Isothermal amplification techniques are being explored for field
      diagnosis of malaria. In this study, a novel molecular tool (loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification-LAMP) targeting the apicoplast genome of Plasmodium
      falciparum was evaluated for the detection of asymptomatic malaria-infected
      individuals in a rural setting in The Gambia. METHODS: A blood was collected from
      341 subjects (median age 9 years, range 1-68 years) screened for malaria. On
      site, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT, SD Bioline Malaria Antigen P.f) was
      performed, thick blood films (TBF) slides for microscopy were prepared and dry
      blood spots (DBS) were collected on Whatman((R)) 903 Specimen collection paper.
      The TBF and DBS were transported to the field laboratory where microscopy and
      LAMP testing were performed. The latter was done on DNA extracted from the DBS
      using a crude (methanol/heating) extraction method. A laboratory-based PCR
      amplification was done on all the samples using DNA extracted with the Qiagen kit
      and its results were taken as reference for all the other tests. RESULTS:
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence was 37 % (127/341) as detected by LAMP, 
      30 % (104/341) by microscopy and 37 % (126/341) by RDT. Compared to the reference
      PCR method, sensitivity was 92 % for LAMP, 78 % for microscopy, and 76 % for RDT;
      specificity was 97 % for LAMP, 99 % for microscopy, and 88 % for RDT. Area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in comparison with the
      reference standard was 0.94 for LAMP, 0.88 for microscopy and 0.81 for RDT.
      Turn-around time for the entire LAMP assay was approximately 3 h and 30 min for
      an average of 27 +/- 9.5 samples collected per day, compared to a minimum of 10
      samples an hour per operator by RDT and over 8 h by microscopy. CONCLUSION: The
      LAMP assay could produce reliable results the same day of the screening. It could
      detect a higher proportion of low density malaria infections than the other
      methods tested and may be used for large campaigns of systematic screening and
      treatment.

      Region, Ghana.
PG  - 959427
LID - 10.1155/2015/959427 [doi]
AB  - Malaria infections undetectable by microscopy but detectable by Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) (submicroscopic malaria) are common in endemic areas like Ghana.
      Submicroscopic malaria has been linked with severe pregnancy outcomes as well as 
      contributing to malaria transmission. In this cross-sectional study 872
      consenting pregnant women (gestation >/= 20 weeks) were recruited from 8
      hospitals in Central Region, Ghana, between July and December 2009. Malaria
      infection was detected by microscopy and PCR. Haemoglobin was measured and
      anaemia was defined as haemoglobin lower than 11 g/dL. Majority of the women, 555
      (63.6%), were Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy with
      Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) users while 234 (36.4%) were nonusers. The
      prevalence of malaria by microscopy was 20.9% (182/872) and 9.7% (67/688) of
      microscopy negative women had submicroscopic malaria. IPTp-SP usage significantly
      (odds ratio = 0.13, 95% confidence interval = 0.07-0.23, p = 0.005) reduced the
      prevalence of submicroscopic malaria as more nonusers (51/234) than users
      (16/454) were PCR positive. After controlling for other variables the effect of
      IPTp-SP remained statistically significant (odds ratio = 0.11, 95% confidence
      interval = 0.02-0.22, p = 0.006). These results suggest that Intermittent
      Preventive Treatment with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine is useful in the reduction
      of submicroscopic malaria in pregnancy.

TI  - The epidemiology of subclinical malaria infections in South-East Asia: findings
      from cross-sectional surveys in Thailand-Myanmar border areas, Cambodia, and
      Vietnam.
PG  - 381
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0906-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of the submicroscopic reservoir of Plasmodium
      infections for malaria elimination depends on its size, which is generally
      considered small in low transmission settings. The precise estimation of this
      reservoir requires more sensitive parasite detection methods. The prevalence of
      asymptomatic, sub-microscopic malaria was assessed by a sensitive, high blood
      volume quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method in three countries
      of the Greater Mekong Sub-region. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted
      in three villages in western Cambodia, four villages along the Thailand-Myanmar
      border and four villages in southwest Vietnam. Malaria parasitaemia was assessed 
      by Plasmodium falciparum/pan malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy
      and a high volume ultra-sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction (HVUSqPCR: 
      limit of detection 22 parasites/mL). All villagers older than 6 months were
      invited to participate. RESULTS: A census before the surveys identified 7355
      residents in the study villages. Parasite prevalence was 224/5008 (4 %) by RDT,
      229/5111 (5 %) by microscopy, and 988/4975 (20 %) when assessed by HVUSqPCR. Of
      these 164 (3 %) were infected with P. falciparum, 357 (7 %) with Plasmodium
      vivax, 56 (1 %) with a mixed infection, and 411 (8 %) had parasite densities that
      were too low for species identification. A history of fever, male sex, and age of
      15 years or older were independently associated with parasitaemia in a
      multivariate regression model stratified by site. CONCLUSION: Light microscopy
      and RDTs identified only a quarter of all parasitaemic participants. The
      asymptomatic Plasmodium reservoir is considerable, even in low transmission
      settings. Novel strategies are needed to eliminate this previously under
      recognized reservoir of malaria transmission.

TI  - High burden of malaria infection in pregnant women in a rural district of Zambia:
      a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 380
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0866-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be a major health problem in low-income
      countries. Consequently, malaria control remains a public health priority in
      endemic countries such as Zambia. Pregnant women and children under 5 years of
      age are among groups at high risk of malaria infection. Malaria infection is
      associated with adverse birth outcomes that affect the mother, foetus, and
      infant. Infection with HIV has been shown to increase the risk of malaria
      infection in pregnancy. The prevalence and the predictors of malaria infection
      among pregnant women resident in the Nchelenge District of northern Zambia were
      investigated. METHODS: Between November 2013 and April 2014, pregnant women in
      the catchment areas of two health centres were recruited during their first
      antenatal care visit. HIV testing was conducted as part of routine care. In
      addition, blood samples were collected from 1086 participants and tested for
      malaria infection using standard microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      techniques specific for Plasmodium falciparum. Multivariate logistic regression
      were conducted to examine the predictors of malaria infection. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of malaria identified by microscopy was 31.8 % (95 % confidence
      intervals [CI], 29.0-34.5; N = 1079) and by PCR was 57.8 % (95 % CI, 54.9-60.8; N
      = 1074). HIV infection was 13.2 % among women on their first antenatal visit; the
      prevalence of malaria detected by PCR among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women
      was 56.7 % (531/936) and 65.2 % (90/138), respectively. In the final model, the
      risk of malaria infection was 81 % higher among pregnant women recruited from
      Nchelenge health centre compared to those attending the Kashikishi health centre 
      (adjusted odds ratio = 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.38-2.37, P < 0.001), and HIV-infected
      women across health centres had a 46 % greater risk of malaria infection compared
      to HIV-uninfected women (adjusted odds ratio = 1.46; 95 %, 1.00-2.13, P = 0.045).
      CONCLUSION: High burden of malaria detected by PCR in these pregnant women
      suggests that past prevention efforts have had limited effect. To reduce this
      burden of malaria sustainably, there is clear need to strengthen existing
      interventions and, possibly, to change approaches so as to improve targeting of
      groups most affected by malaria.

TI  - RDTs as a source of DNA to study Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in
      isolates from Senegal and the Comoros Islands.
PG  - 373
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0861-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has recommended rapid diagnostic tests 
      (RDTs) for use in the diagnosis of suspected malaria cases. In addition to
      providing quick and accurate detection of Plasmodium parasite proteins in the
      blood, these tests can be used as sources of DNA for further genetic studies. As 
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is used currently for intermittent presumptive
      treatment of pregnant women in both Senegal and in the Comoros Islands,
      resistance mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes were investigated using DNA
      extracted from RDTs. METHODS: The proximal portion of the nitrocellulose membrane
      of discarded RDTs was used for DNA extraction. This genomic DNA was amplified
      using HRM to genotype the molecular markers involved in resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine: dhfr (51, 59, 108, and 164) and dhps (436, 437, 540,
      581, and 613). Additionally, the msp1 and msp2 genes were amplified to determine 
      the average clonality between Grande-Comore (Comoros) and Thies (Senegal).
      RESULTS: A total of 201 samples were successfully genotyped at all codons by HRM;
      whereas, in 200 msp1 and msp2 genes were successfully amplified and genotyped by 
      nested PCR. A high prevalence of resistance mutations were observed in the dhfr
      gene at codons 51, 59, and 108 as well as in the dhps gene at codons 437 and 436.
      A novel mutant in dhps at codon positions 436Y/437A was observed. The dhfr I164L 
      codon and dhps K540 and dhps A581G codons had 100 % wild type alleles in all
      samples. CONCLUSION: The utility of field-collected RDTs was validated as a
      source of DNA for genetic studies interrogating frequencies of drug resistance
      mutations, using two different molecular methods (PCR and High Resolution
      Melting). RDTs should not be discarded after use as they can be a valuable source
      of DNA for genetic and epidemiological studies in sites where filter paper or
      venous blood collected samples are nonexistent.

TI  - Lack of effect of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy and 
      intense drug resistance in western Uganda.
PG  - 372
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0909-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is widely implemented in sub-Saharan Africa for
      the prevention of malaria in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. However, in
      areas of intense SP resistance, the efficacy of IPTp may be compromised. METHODS:
      A cross-sectional study among 915 delivering women (728 analysable live singleton
      deliveries) was conducted in Fort Portal, western Uganda, to assess associations 
      of reported IPTp use, Plasmodium falciparum infection, maternal anaemia, low
      birth weight, and preterm delivery, and to estimate the degree of SP resistance
      as reflected by pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum infection
      was detected by PCR in 8.9 % and by microscopy of placental blood samples in 4.0 
      %. Infection was significantly associated with stillbirth, early neonatal death, 
      anaemia, low birth weight, and pre-term delivery. Eighty percent of the women had
      taken at least one dose of IPTp, and more than half had taken two doses. As
      compared to women without chemoprophylaxis against malaria, IPTp had no
      significant influence on the presence of P. falciparum infection (13.8 vs. 9.6 %,
      P = 0.31). Nor was it associated with reductions in anaemia, low birth weight or 
      preterm delivery. P. falciparum with intense SP resistance (pfdhfr/pfdhps
      quintuple or sextuple mutations) were observed in 93 % (pfdhps 581G, 36 %), and
      the additional high resistance allele pfhdr 164L in 36 %. CONCLUSIONS: In Fort
      Portal, Uganda, reported use of IPTp with SP does not provide an observable
      benefit. The molecular markers of P. falciparum indicate high grade SP resistance
      reaching the threshold set by WHO for the discontinuation of IPTp with SP.
      Alternative approaches for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy are urgently
      needed.

TI  - Disagreement in genotyping results of drug resistance alleles of the Plasmodium
      falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) gene by allele-specific PCR (ASPCR)
      assays and Sanger sequencing.
PG  - 323-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4750-2 [doi]
AB  - The rapid spread of antimalarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum over
      the past few decades has necessitated intensive monitoring of such resistance for
      an effective malaria control strategy. P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase
      (Pfdhps) and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) genes act as
      molecular markers for resistance against the antimalarial drugs sulphadoxine and 
      pyrimethamine, respectively. Resistance to pyrimethamine which is used as a
      partner drug in artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is associated with several 
      mutations in the Pfdhfr gene, namely A16V, N51I, C59R, S108N/T and I164L.
      Therefore, routine monitoring of Pfdhfr-drug-resistant alleles in a population
      may help in effective drug resistance management. Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) is 
      one of the commonly used methods for molecular genotyping of these alleles. In
      this study, we genotyped 55 samples of P. falciparum for allele discrimination at
      four codons of Pfdhfr (N51, C59, S108 and I164) by ASPCR using published methods 
      and by Sanger's DNA sequencing method. We found that the ASPCR identified a
      significantly higher number of mutant alleles as compared to the DNA sequencing
      method. Such discrepancies arise due to the non-specificity of some of the
      allele-specific primer sets and due to the lack of sensitivity of Sanger's DNA
      sequencing method to detect minor alleles present in multiple clone infections.
      This study reveals the need of a highly specific and sensitive method for
      genotyping and detecting minor drug-resistant alleles present in multiple clonal 
      infections.

TI  - Influence of Sickle Cell Gene on the Allelic Diversity at the msp-1 locus of
      Plasmodium falciparum in Adult Patients with Severe Malaria.
PG  - e2015050
LID - 10.4084/MJHID.2015.050 [doi]
AB  - Although several studies have supported that sickle cell trait (HbAS) protects
      against falciparum malaria, the exact mechanism by which sickle gene confers
      protection is unclear. Further, there is no information on the influence of the
      sickle gene on the parasitic diversity of P. falciparum population in severe
      symptomatic malaria. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of the sickle
      gene on the parasite densities and diversities in hospitalized adult patients
      with severe falciparum malaria. The study was carried out in 166 adults
      hospitalized subjects with severe falciparum malaria at Sickle Cell Clinic and
      Molecular Biology Laboratory, Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and
      Research, Burla, Odisha, India. They were divided into three groups on the basis 
      of hemoglobin variants HbAA (n=104), HbAS (n=30) and HbSS (n=32). The msp-1 loci 
      were genotyped using a PCR-based methodology. The parasite densities were
      significantly high in HbAA compared to HbAS and HbSS. The multiplicity of
      infection (MOI) and multi-clonality for msp-1 were significantly low in HbSS and 
      HbAS compared to HbAA. The prevalence of K1 (p<0 .0001) and MAD20 (p=0.0003)
      alleles were significantly high in HbAA. The RO33 allele was detected at a higher
      frequency in HbSS and HbAS, compared to K1 and MAD20. Sickle gene was found to
      reduce both the parasite densities and diversity of P. falciparum in adults with 
      severe malaria.

TI  - Distribution of Plasmodium vivax pvdhfr and pvdhps alleles and their association 
      with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment outcomes in Indonesia.
PG  - 365
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0903-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sympatric existence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax,
      and the practice of malaria treatment without microscopic confirmation suggest
      that the accidental treatment of vivax malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP) is common. METHODS: In this study, the frequency distribution of alleles
      associated with SP resistance were analysed among the P. vivax infections from
      malariometric surveys and its association with SP treatment failure in clinical
      studies in Indonesia. The dhfr and dhps alleles were detected using PCR-RFLP
      method. RESULTS: Analysis of 159 P. vivax isolates from malariometric surveys and
      69 samples from in vivo SP efficacy study revealed various the existence of
      various alleles of the pvdhfr and pfdhps genes including 57L/I, 58R, 61M, and
      117N/T. Allele 13L of the dhfr gene and 553G of the dhps gene were not detected
      in any isolates examined in both studies. In the dhfr gene, tandem repeat type-A 
      was the major tandem repeat observed in any isolates analysed. In the dhps gene, 
      only the 383G allele was observed. Isolates carrying double, triple and quadruple
      mutants of dhfr gene were found in Lampung, Purworejo, Sumba, and Papua. Although
      this study revealed a wide distribution of dhfr and dhps alleles among the P.
      vivax isolates across a broad geographic regions in Indonesia, impact on SP
      efficacy was not observed in Sumba. CONCLUSION: With proper malaria diagnosis, SP
      may still be used as a rational anti-malarial drug either as a single
      prescription or in combination with artemisinin.

AB  - Malaria remains an important public health issue all over the world. Among 5
      Plasmodium species invasive to humans, Plasmodium knowlesi has been identified
      most recently. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate this species from P.
      malariae with the use of microscopic examination. However, P. knowlesi infection 
      may be associated with rapidly increasing parasitaemia and severe clinical course
      with the risk of death. Samples from Polish travellers returning from areas where
      simian malaria is endemic were examined with the use of polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR). The small subunit of ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes was subjected to
      analysis using nested PCR reaction. No positive results of P. knowlesi were
      obtained. Due to morphological similarities to P. malariae, potentially severe
      clinical course of infection and P. knowlesi endemic regions being a common
      tourist destination, diagnostic and clinical vigilance is necessary, including
      molecular methods use for precise parasite identification.

TI  - Baseline data of parasite clearance in patients with falciparum malaria treated
      with an artemisinin derivative: an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 359
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0874-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum manifests as slow
      parasite clearance but this measure is also influenced by host immunity, initial 
      parasite biomass and partner drug efficacy. This study collated data from
      clinical trials of artemisinin derivatives in falciparum malaria with frequent
      parasite counts to provide reference parasite clearance estimates stratified by
      location, treatment and time, to examine host factors affecting parasite
      clearance, and to assess the relationships between parasite clearance and risk of
      recrudescence during follow-up. METHODS: Data from 24 studies, conducted from
      1996 to 2013, with frequent parasite counts were pooled. Parasite clearance
      half-life (PC1/2) was estimated using the WWARN Parasite Clearance Estimator.
      Random effects regression models accounting for study and site heterogeneity were
      used to explore factors affecting PC1/2 and risk of recrudescence within areas
      with reported delayed parasite clearance (western Cambodia, western Thailand
      after 2000, southern Vietnam, southern Myanmar) and in all other areas where
      parasite populations are artemisinin sensitive. RESULTS: PC1/2 was estimated in
      6975 patients, 3288 of whom also had treatment outcomes evaluate d during 28-63
      days follow-up, with 93 (2.8 %) PCR-confirmed recrudescences. In areas with
      artemisinin-sensitive parasites, the median PC1/2 following three-day artesunate 
      treatment (4 mg/kg/day) ranged from 1.8 to 3.0 h and the proportion of patients
      with PC1/2 >5 h from 0 to 10 %. Artesunate doses of 4 mg/kg/day decreased PC1/2
      by 8.1 % (95 % CI 3.2-12.6) compared to 2 mg/kg/day, except in populations with
      delayed parasite clearance. PC1/2 was longer in children and in patients with
      fever or anaemia at enrolment. Long PC1/2 (HR = 2.91, 95 % CI 1.95-4.34 for
      twofold increase, p < 0.001) and high initial parasitaemia (HR = 2.23, 95 % CI
      1.44-3.45 for tenfold increase, p < 0.001) were associated independently with an 
      increased risk of recrudescence. In western Cambodia, the region with the highest
      prevalence of artemisinin resistance, there was no evidence for increasing PC1/2 
      since 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect PC1/2. As substantial
      heterogeneity in parasite clearance exists between locations, early detection of 
      artemisinin resistance requires reference PC1/2 data. Studies with frequent
      parasite count measurements to characterize PC1/2 should be encouraged. In
      western Cambodia, where PC1/2 values are longest, there is no evidence for recent
      emergence of higher levels of artemisinin resistance.

TI  - Quality of malaria diagnosis and molecular confirmation of Plasmodium ovale
      curtisi in a rural area of the southeastern region of Ethiopia.
PG  - 357

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 50 million people (60 %) live in malaria risk areas in 
      Ethiopia, at altitudes below 2000 m. According to official data, 60-70 % of
      malaria cases are due to Plasmodium falciparum, and 40-30 % by Plasmodium vivax. 
      The species Plasmodium ovale was detected in 2013 in the northwest of the
      country, being the first report of the presence of this species in Ethiopia since
      the 60 s. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnosis by microscopy and
      PCR, and demonstrate the presence of other Plasmodium species in the country.
      METHODS: The survey was conducted in Bulbula, situated in the Rift Valley (West
      Arsi Province, Oromia Region). From December 2010 to October 2011, 3060 samples
      were collected from patients with symptoms of malaria; the diagnosis of malaria
      was done by microscopy and confirmation by PCR. RESULTS: 736 samples were
      positive for malaria by microscopy. After removing the 260 samples (109 positives
      and 151 negatives) for which it was not possible to do PCR, there were a total of
      2800 samples, 1209 are used for its confirmation by PCR and quality control (627 
      are positives and 582 negatives by microscopy). From the 627 positive samples,
      604 were confirmed as positive by PCR, 23 false positives were detected, and the 
      group of 582 negative samples, 184 were positive by PCR (false negatives), which 
      added to the previous positive samples is a total of 788, positive samples for
      some species of Plasmodium sp. 13.3 % more positives were detected with the PCR
      than the microscopy. Importantly, 23 samples were detected by PCR as P. ovale,
      after the sequencing of these samples was determined as P. ovale curtisi.
      CONCLUSIONS: The PCR detected more positive samples than the microscopy; in
      addition, P. ovale and P. ovale/P. vivax were detected that had not been detected
      by microscopy, which can affect in the infection control.

TI  - Polymorphism in drug resistance genes dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate
      synthase in Plasmodium falciparum in some states of India.
PG  - 471
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-1080-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination drug is currently being
      used in India for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum as partner drug in
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Resistance to sulfadoxine and
      pyrimethamine in P. falciparum is linked with mutations in dihydropteroate
      synthase (pfdhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) genes respectively. This
      study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of such mutations in pfdhfr and
      pfdhps genes in four states of India. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates
      were collected from two states of India with high malaria incidence i.e.,
      Jharkhand and Odisha and two states with low malaria incidence i.e., Andhra
      Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh between years 2006 to 2012. Part of
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) drug resistance genes, pfdhfr and pfdhps were
      PCR-amplified, sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 217 confirmed P.
      falciparum isolates were sequenced for both Pfdhfr and pfdhps gene. Two pfdhfr
      mutations 59R and 108N were most common mutations prevalent in all localities in 
      77 % of isolates. Additionally, I164L was found in Odisha and Jharkhand only
      (4/70 and 8/84, respectively). Another mutation 51I was found in Odisha only
      (3/70). The pfdhps mutations 436A, 437G, 540E and 581G were found in Jharkhand
      and Odisha only in 13, 26, 14 and 13 % isolates respectively, and was absent in
      Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Combined together for pfdhps and pfdhfr locus, 
      triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple mutations were present in Jharkhand and
      Odisha while absent in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. CONCLUSION: While only
      double mutants of pfdhfr was present in low transmission area (Uttar Pradesh and 
      Andhra Pradesh) with total absence of pfdhps mutants, up to sextuple mutations
      were present in high transmission areas (Odisha and Jharkhand) for both the genes
      combined. Presence of multiple mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes linked to SP 
      resistance in high transmission area may lead to fixation of multiple mutations
      in presence of high drug pressure and high recombination rate.

PG  - 350
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0882-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and real-time PCR (qPCR) assays are
      sensitive for diagnosing malaria, but because they detect antigen and DNA,
      respectively, positivity may not reflect active infection. Performance
      characteristics of RDT and qPCR in Plasmodium falciparum positive specimens were 
      evaluated over time to elucidate duration of positivity following conversion to
      microscopy negative. METHODS: Specimens from patients with at least one specimen 
      that was positive for P. falciparum by microscopy, and at least one specimen that
      was negative for P. falciparum within a 1-month period were identified. Survival 
      distributions of the diagnostic tests over time were compared. Performance
      characteristics for each test were calculated. RESULTS: Ninety specimens were
      included, with 48 initially positive for P. falciparum, and 42 subsequently
      negative. Of 42 specimens that converted to microscopy-negative following an
      initial positive, 26 (61.9 %) and 41 (97.6 %) were positive by qPCR and RDT,
      respectively. Survival curves of microscopy versus qPCR, as well as microscopy vs
      RDT differed significantly (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Compared to
      microscopy, sensitivity of qPCR was 100.0 % (95 % CI 90.8-100.0 %), and that of
      RDT was 100.0 % (95 % CI 90.8-100.0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Due to slow clearance of
      circulating antigen and DNA from bloodstream, RDT and qPCR have low positive
      predictive value for clinically relevant asexual parasitaemia in post-treatment
      specimens. Thus, microscopy remains the only available malaria diagnostic that
      can reliably distinguish true asexual parasitaemia from prolonged clearance of
      antigen and nucleic acid in a convalescing patient.

TI  - Absence of association between Plasmodium falciparum small sub-unit ribosomal RNA
      gene mutations and in vitro decreased susceptibility to doxycycline.
PG  - 348
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0878-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Doxycycline is an antibiotic used in combination with quinine or
      artesunate for malaria treatment or alone for malaria chemoprophylaxis. Recently,
      one prophylactic failure has been reported, and several studies have highlighted 
      in vitro doxycycline decreased susceptibility in Plasmodium falciparum isolates
      from different areas. The genetic markers that contribute to detecting and
      monitoring the susceptibility of P. falciparum to doxycycline, the pfmdt and
      pftetQ genes, have recently been identified. However, these markers are not
      sufficient to explain in vitro decreased susceptibility of P. falciparum to
      doxycycline. In this paper, the association between polymorphism of the small
      sub-unit ribosomal RNA apicoplastic gene pfssrRNA (PFC10_API0057) and in vitro
      susceptibilities of P. falciparum isolates to doxycycline were investigated.
      METHODS: Doxycycline IC50 determinations using the hypoxanthine uptake inhibition
      assay were performed on 178 African and Thai P. falciparum isolates. The
      polymorphism of pfssrRNA was investigated in these samples by standard PCR
      followed by sequencing. RESULTS: No point mutations were found in pfssrRNA in the
      Thai or African isolates, regardless of the determined IC50 values. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The pfssrRNA gene is not associated with in vitro decreased susceptibility of P. 
      falciparum to doxycycline. Identifying new in vitro molecular markers associated 
      with reduced susceptibility is needed, to survey the emergence of doxycycline
      resistance.

TI  - Prevalence of the dhfr and dhps Mutations among Pregnant Women in Rural Burkina
      Faso Five Years after the Introduction of Intermittent Preventive Treatment with 
      Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of drug resistance represents one of the
      biggest challenges for malaria control in endemic regions.
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently deployed as intermittent preventive
      treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) to prevent the adverse effects of malaria on the
      mother and her offspring. Nevertheless, its efficacy is threatened by SP
      resistance which can be estimated by the prevalence of dihydropteroate synthase
      (dhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) mutations. This was measured among
      pregnant women in the health district of Nanoro, Burkina Faso. METHODS: From June
      to December 2010, two hundred and fifty six pregnant women in the second and
      third trimester, attending antenatal care with microscopically confirmed malaria 
      infection were invited to participate, regardless of malaria symptoms. A blood
      sample was collected on filter paper and analyzed by PCR-RFLP for the alleles 51,
      59, 108, 164 in the pfdhfr gene and 437, 540 in the pfdhps gene. RESULTS: The
      genes were successfully genotyped in all but one sample (99.6%; 255/256) for dhfr
      and in 90.2% (231/256) for dhps. The dhfr C59R and S108N mutations were the most 
      common, with a prevalence of 61.2% (156/255) and 55.7% (142/255), respectively;
      12.2% (31/255) samples had also the dhfr N51I mutation while the I164L mutation
      was absent. The dhps A437G mutation was found in 34.2% (79/231) isolates, but
      none of them carried the codon K540E. The prevalence of the dhfr double mutations
      NRNI and the triple mutations IRNI was 35.7% (91/255) and 11.4% (29/255),
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Though the mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes
      were relatively common, the prevalence of the triple pfdhfr mutation was very
      low, indicating that SP as IPTp is still efficacious in Burkina Faso.

TI  - Hotspots of Malaria Transmission in the Peruvian Amazon: Rapid Assessment through
      a Parasitological and Serological Survey.
PG  - e0137458
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With low and markedly seasonal malaria transmission, increasingly
      sensitive tools for better stratifying the risk of infection and targeting
      control interventions are needed. A cross-sectional survey to characterize the
      current malaria transmission patterns, identify hotspots, and detect recent
      changes using parasitological and serological measures was conducted in three
      sites of the Peruvian Amazon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After full census of the
      study population, 651 participants were interviewed, clinically examined and had 
      a blood sample taken for the detection of malaria parasites (microscopy and PCR) 
      and antibodies against P. vivax (PvMSP119, PvAMA1) and P. falciparum (PfGLURP,
      PfAMA1) antigens by ELISA. Risk factors for malaria infection (positive PCR) and 
      malaria exposure (seropositivity) were assessed by multivariate survey logistic
      regression models. Age-specific seroprevalence was analyzed using a reversible
      catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood for generating
      seroconversion rates (SCR, lambda). SaTScan was used to detect spatial clusters
      of serology-positive individuals within each site. RESULTS: The overall parasite 
      prevalence by PCR was low, i.e. 3.9% for P. vivax and 6.7% for P. falciparum,
      while the seroprevalence was substantially higher, 33.6% for P. vivax and 22.0%
      for P. falciparum, with major differences between study sites. Age and location
      (site) were significantly associated with P. vivax exposure; while location, age 
      and outdoor occupation were associated with P. falciparum exposure. P. falciparum
      seroprevalence curves showed a stable transmission throughout time, while for P. 
      vivax transmission was better described by a model with two SCRs. The spatial
      analysis identified well-defined clusters of P. falciparum seropositive
      individuals in two sites, while it detected only a very small cluster of P. vivax
      exposure. CONCLUSION: The use of a single parasitological and serological malaria
      survey has proven to be an efficient and accurate method to characterize the
      species specific heterogeneity in malaria transmission at micro-geographical
      level as well as to identify recent changes in transmission.

TI  - Molecular Testing for Plasmodium falciparum by Use of Serum or Plasma and
      Comparison with Microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Testing in Febrile Nigerian
      Patients.
PG  - 3596-600
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01876-15 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium nucleic acids have been detected in serum and plasma, but there is
      little published data describing the diagnostic performance of malaria nucleic
      acid amplification tests (NAATs) using these specimen types. Previously, our
      group described a multiplex NAAT for the detection of dengue virus, Leptospira,
      and Plasmodium species with a callout for P. falciparum (the DLM assay) that
      demonstrated sensitive detection of P. falciparum from plasma samples during
      initial evaluation. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity
      of P. falciparum detection in febrile Nigerian patients using the DLM assay,
      microscopy, and a rapid diagnostic test (BinaxNOW Malaria). Assay performances
      were compared using a composite reference, which was considered positive if
      malaria was detected by two or more methods. Serum (n = 182) or plasma (n = 148) 
      from 317 patients was tested; the average sample volume was 70 mul (range, 5 to
      300 mul). The sensitivity and specificity of the DLM assay were 97.1% and 93.5%, 
      respectively. The sensitivity of the malaria rapid diagnostic test (98.1%) was
      similar to that of the DLM assay, and both proved significantly more sensitive
      than microscopy (79%; P < 0.0001). When analysis was limited to samples with
      >/=75 mul of serum or plasma, the sensitivity of the DLM assay improved to 99%
      and specificity was 97.5%. For P. falciparum cases, cycle threshold values in the
      DLM assay correlated with the parasite density detected by microscopy (Spearman's
      rank correlation coefficient, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, malaria detection using
      the DLM assay on serum or plasma is more sensitive than and equal in specificity 
      to microscopy in patients with P. falciparum malaria.

TI  - Novel Cross-Border Approaches to Optimise Identification of Asymptomatic and
      Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium Infection in Mobile Populations Crossing
      Cambodian Borders.
PG  - e0124300
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0124300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human population movement across country borders presents a real
      challenge for malaria control and elimination efforts in Cambodia and its
      neighbouring countries. To quantify Plasmodium infection among the
      border-crossing population, including asymptomatic and artemisinin resistant (AR)
      parasites, three official border crossing points, one from each of Cambodia's
      borders with Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, were selected for sampling. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: A total of 3206 participants (of 4110 approached) were recruited as
      they crossed the border, tested for malaria and interviewed. By real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 5.4% of all screened individuals were found
      to harbour Plasmodium parasites. The proportion was highest at the Laos border
      (11.5%). Overall there were 97 P. vivax (55.7%), 55 P. falciparum (31.6%), two P.
      malariae (1.1%) and 20 mixed infections (11.5%). Of identified infections, only
      20% were febrile at the time of screening. Of the 24 P. falciparum samples where 
      a further PCR was possible to assess AR, 15 (62.5%) had mutations in the K13
      propeller domain gene, all from participants at the Laos border point. Malaria
      rapid diagnostic test (RDT) pLDH/HRP-2 identified a positivity rate of 3.2%
      overall and sensitivity compared to RT-PCR was very low (43.1%). Main individual 
      risk factors for infection included sex, fever, being a forest-goer, poor
      knowledge of malaria prevention methods and previous malaria infection.
      Occupation, day of the week and time of crossing (morning vs. afternoon) also
      appeared to play an important role in predicting positive cases. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study offers a novel approach to identify asymptomatic infections and
      monitor AR parasite flow among mobile and migrant populations crossing the
      borders. Similar screening activities are recommended to identify other hot
      borders and characterise potential hot spots of AR. Targeted "customised"
      interventions and surveillance activities should be implemented in these sites to
      accelerate elimination efforts in the region.

AB  - Two years after the introduction of free Artesunate-Amodiaquine (ASAQ) and
      Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in public
      health facilities in Cote d'Ivoire, we carried out this study to compare their
      efficacy and tolerability in three surveillance sites. It was a multicentre open 
      randomised clinical trial of 3-day ASAQ treatment against AL for the treatment of
      2 parallel groups of patients aged 2 years and above. The endpoints were (1)
      Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) at day 28 and (2) the
      clinical and biological tolerability. Of the 300 patients who were enrolled 289, 
      with 143 (49.5%) and 146 (50.5%) in the ASAQ and AL groups, respectively,
      correctly followed the WHO 2003 protocol we used. The PCR-corrected ACPR was
      99.3% for each group. More than 94% of patients no longer showed signs of fever, 
      48 hours after treatment. Approximately 78% of the people in the ASAQ group had a
      parasite clearance time of 48 hours or less compared to 81% in the AL group (p = 
      0.496). Both drugs were found to be well tolerated by the patients. This study
      demonstrates the effectiveness and tolerability of ASAQ and AL supporting their
      continuous use for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infection
      in Cote d'Ivoire.

TI  - Ferroquine and artesunate in African adults and children with Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind,
      dose-ranging, non-inferiority study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended
      first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Ferroquine 
      is a new combination partner for fast-acting ACTs such as artesunate. We aimed to
      assess different doses of ferroquine in combination with artesunate against
      uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in a heterogeneous population in Africa.
      METHODS: We did a phase 2, multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised,
      dose-ranging non-inferiority trial at eight African hospitals (two in Gabon,
      three in Burkina Faso, one in Benin, and two in Kenya). We recruited patients
      presenting with acute P falciparum monoinfection (1000-200,000 parasites per
      muL), and a central body temperature of at least 37.5 degrees C or history of
      fever in the past 24 h. We assessed patients in two sequential cohorts: cohort 1 
      contained adults (bodyweight >50 kg) and adolescents (aged >/=14 years, >30 kg), 
      and cohort 2 contained children (aged 2-13 years, 15-30 kg). We randomly assigned
      patients (1:1:1:1) to receive artesunate 4 mg/kg per day plus ferroquine 2 mg/kg,
      4 mg/kg, or 6 mg/kg, given double-blind once per day for 3 days, or ferroquine
      monotherapy 4 mg/kg per day given single-blind (ie, allocation was only masked
      from the patient) once per day for 3 days. We did 14 patient visits (screening, 3
      treatment days and 48 h post-treatment surveillance, a visit on day 7, then one
      follow-up visit per week until day 63). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority 
      of treatment in terms of PCR-corrected cure rate against a reference value of
      90%, with a 10% non-inferiority margin, assessed in patients treated without
      major protocol deviations for parasitologically confirmed malaria. We assessed
      safety in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
      number NCT00988507, and is closed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 16, 2009, and Sept 22,
      2010, we randomly assigned 326 eligible patients to treatment groups, with last
      follow-up visit on Dec 1, 2010. 284 patients (87%) were available for
      per-protocol analyses. At day 28, PCR-confirmed cure was noted in 68 (97%, 95% CI
      90-100) of 70 patients treated with ferroquine 2 mg/kg plus artesunate, 73 (99%, 
      93-100) of 74 with ferroquine 4 mg/kg plus artesunate, 71 (99%, 93-100) of 72
      with ferroquine 6 mg/kg plus artesunate, and 54 (79%, 68-88) of 68 with
      ferroquine 4 mg/kg monotherapy. The three dose groups of ferroquine plus
      artesunate met the non-inferiority hypothesis. The most common adverse events
      were headache in cohort 1 (30 [19%] of 162 patients) and worsening malaria in
      cohort 2 (23 [14%] of 164 patients); occurrences were similar between treatment
      groups. INTERPRETATION: Ferroquine combined with artesunate was associated with
      high cure rates and was safe at all doses tested, and could be a promising new
      drug combination for the treatment of P falciparum malaria. Ferroquine could also
      partner other drugs to establish a new generation of antimalarial combinations,
      especially in regions that have developed resistance to ACTs. FUNDING: Sanofi.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimalarial drug resistance is a primary public health problem.
      Haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1 gene have been implicated to be molecular markers 
      of chloroquine (CQ) resistance. This study aims to explore mutation distribution 
      of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG). METHODS: Blood
      samples were collected from different districts of Bioko. The single nucleotide
      polymorphisms in Pfcrt (codons 72 to 76) and Pfmdr1 (codons 86, 130, 184, 1034,
      1042, 1109 and 1246) were assessed by nested PCR with DNA sequencing and
      haplotype prevalences were also determined. RESULTS: Analysis of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1
      mutations was successful in 151 and 157 samples respectively out of the 172
      samples taken for this study. The mutations of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 were found in
      98.67% and 89.81% isolates, respectively. The Pfcrt 74-76, Pfmdr1 86, and Pfmdr1 
      184 were 92.05%, 50.32%, and 87.26% found mostly of mutation type, respectively. 
      Three haplotypes coding 72-76 of Pfcrt were found including CVMNK, CVIET, and
      CVM/I N/E K/T, which accounted for 1.33%, 92.05%, and 6.62%, respectively. No
      mutation in Pfmdr1-N1 codon at 130 and Pfmdr1-N2 (S1034C, N1042D, V1109I, and
      D1246Y) was detected. The types coding 86 and 184 in Pfmdr1 were found including 
      NY, YY, NF, YF, NY/F and YY/F, which accounted for 10.19%, 2.55%, 33.76%, 45.22%,
      5.73% and 2.55%, respectively. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of Pfcrt CVIET and
      Pfmdr1 86Y, 184F double mutations confirm high-level CQ resistance (CQR) and
      might suggest reduced susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum isolates to AQ in
      Bioko, EG. It establishes fundamental data for detection of P. falciparum CQR
      with molecular markers and will promotes the surveillance level of drug
      resistance in Bioko, EG.

      acid plus ferrous ion against malaria.

LID - 10.1128/AAC.01910-15 [doi]
AB  - 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring amino acid present in
      diverse organisms and a precursor of heme biosynthesis. ALA is commercially
      available as a component of cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals
      for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Recent reports demonstrated that the
      combination of ALA and ferrous ion (Fe(2+)) inhibits the in vitro growth of the
      human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To further explore the potential
      application of ALA and ferrous ion as a combined antimalarial drug for treatment 
      of human malaria, we conducted an in vivo efficacy evaluation. Female C57BL/6J
      mice were infected with the lethal strain of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium
      yoelii 17XL and orally administered ALA plus sodium ferrous citrate (ALA/SFC) as 
      a once-daily treatment. Parasitemia was monitored in the infected mice, and
      elimination of the parasites was confirmed using diagnostic PCR. Treatment of P. 
      yoelii 17XL-infected mice with ALA/SFC provided curative efficacy in 60% of the
      mice treated with ALA/SFC at 600/300 mg/kg of body weight; no mice survived when 
      treated with vehicle alone. Interestingly, the cured mice were protected from
      homologous rechallenge, even when reinfection was attempted more than 230 days
      after the initial recovery, indicating long-lasting resistance to reinfection
      with the same parasite. Moreover, parasite-specific antibodies against reported
      vaccine candidate antigens were found and persisted in the sera of the cured
      mice. These findings provide clear evidence that ALA/SFC is effective in an
      experimental animal model of malaria and may facilitate the development of a new 
      class of antimalarial drug.

AB  - The present study determined and compared the genetic diversity of Plasmodium
      falciparum strains infecting children living in 2 areas from Gabon with different
      malaria endemicity. Blood samples were collected from febrile children from 2008 
      to 2009 in 2 health centres from rural (Oyem) and urban (Owendo) areas. Genetic
      diversity was determined in P. falciparum isolates by analyzing the merozoite
      surface protein-1 (msp1) gene polymorphism using nested-PCR. Overall, 168
      children with mild falciparum malaria were included. K1, Ro33, and Mad20 alleles 
      were found in 110 (65.5%), 94 (55.9%), and 35 (20.8%) isolates, respectively,
      without difference according to the site (P>0.05). Allelic families' frequencies 
      were comparable between children less than 5 years old from the 2 sites; while
      among the older children the proportions of Ro33 and Mad20 alleles were 1.7 to
      2.0 fold higher at Oyem. Thirty-three different alleles were detected, 16 (48.5%)
      were common to both sites, and 10 out of the 17 specific alleles were found at
      Oyem. Furthermore, multiple infection carriers were frequent at Oyem (57.7% vs
      42.2% at Owendo; P=0.04) where the complexity of infection was of 1.88 (+/-0.95) 
      higher compared to that found at Owendo (1.55+/-0.75). Extended genetic diversity
      of P. falciparum strains infecting Gabonese symptomatic children and high
      multiplicity of infections were observed in rural area. Alleles common to the 2
      sites were frequent; the site-specific alleles predominated in the rural area.
      Such distribution of the alleles should be taken into accounts when designing
      MSP1 or MSP2 malaria vaccine.

      report.
PG  - 910-3
LID - 10.3855/jidc.6813 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is associated with numerous complications and high
      mortality, whereas Plasmodium vivax (Pv) infection is generally considered to be 
      benign. However, severe complications, such as acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) in Pv infection, are emerging. This case report highlights the
      complication of ARDS during the course of Pv infection in a 60-year-old woman.
      The diagnosis of the patient was made using microscopy, immunochromatography, and
      polymerase chain reaction assays for Pf and Pv species. The data indicated the
      presence of mono-Pv infection in the patient's blood, and Pf infection was
      specifically ruled out. The patient was discharged after intensive supportive
      care and antimalarial treatment. Pv infection is associated with ARDS and other
      complications such as sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; this enhanced 
      severity of Pv infection, if unrecognized, can lead to more deaths in
      malaria-endemic areas.

AB  - Current diagnosis of malaria is based on the combined and sequential use of rapid
      antigen detection tests (RDT) of Plasmodium and subsequent visualization of the
      parasite stained with Giemsa solution in a thin and thick blood smears. If an
      expert microscopist is not available, should always be a sensitive RDT to rule
      out infection by Plasmodium falciparum, output the result immediately and prepare
      thick smears (air dried) and thin extensions (fixed with methanol) for subsequent
      staining and review by an expert microscopist. The RDT should be used as an
      initial screening test, but should not replace microscopy techniques, which
      should be done in parallel. The diagnosis of malaria should be performed
      immediately after clinical suspicion. The delay in laboratory diagnosis (greater 
      than 3 hours) should not prevent the initiation of empirical antimalarial
      treatment if the probability of malaria is high. If the first microscopic
      examination and RDT are negative, they must be repeated daily in patients with
      high suspicion. If suspicion remains after three negative results must be sought 
      the opinion of an tropical diseases expert. Genomic amplification methods (PCR)
      are useful as confirmation of microscopic diagnosis, to characterize mixed
      infections undetectable by other methods, and to diagnose asymptomatic infections
      with submicroscopic parasitaemia.

TI  - A simple, high-throughput, colourimetric, field applicable loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (HtLAMP) assay for malaria elimination.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0848-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To detect all malaria infections in elimination settings sensitive,
      high throughput and field deployable diagnostic tools are required. Loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (LAMP) represents a possible field-applicable molecular 
      diagnostic tool. However, current LAMP platforms are limited by their capacity
      for high throughput. METHODS: A high-throughput LAMP (HtLAMP) platform amplifying
      mitochondrial targets using a 96-well microtitre plate platform, processing 85
      samples and 11 controls, using hydroxynaphtholblue as a colourimetric indicator
      was optimized for the detection of malaria parasites. Objective confirmation of
      visually detectable colour change results was made using a spectrophotometer. A
      dilution series of laboratory-cultured 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum parasites was
      used to determine the limit of detection of the HtLAMP assay, using P. falciparum
      (HtLAMP-Pf) and Plasmodium genus (HtLAMP-Pg) primers, on whole blood and filter
      paper, and using different DNA extraction protocols. The diagnostic accuracy of
      HtLAMP was validated using clinical samples from Papua New Guinea, Malaysia,
      Ghana and The Gambia and its field applicability was evaluated in Kota Marudu
      district hospital, Sabah, Malaysia. RESULTS: The HtLAMP assay proved to be a
      simple method generating a visually-detectable blue and purple colour change that
      could be objectively confirmed in a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm. 
      When compared with PCR, overall HtLAMP-Pg had a sensitivity of 98 % (n = 260/266,
      95 % CI 95-99) and specificity 83 % (n = 15/18, 95 % CI 59-96). HtLAMP-Pf had a
      sensitivity of 97 % (n = 124/128, 95 % CI 92-99) and specificity of 96 % (n =
      151/157, 95 % CI 92-99). A validation study in a regional hospital laboratory
      demonstrated ease of performance and interpretation of the HtLAMP assay.
      HtLAMP-Pf performed in this field setting had a sensitivity of 100 % (n = 17/17, 
      95 % CI 80-100) and specificity of 95 % (n = 123/128, 95 % CI 90-98) compared
      with multiplex PCR. HtLAMP-Pf also performed well on filter paper samples from
      asymptomatic Ghanaian children with a sensitivity of 88 % (n = 23/25, 95 % CI
      69-97). CONCLUSION: This colourimetric HtLAMP assay holds much promise as a field
      applicable molecular diagnostic tool for the purpose of malaria elimination.

AB  - Deletion of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene may 
      affect the performance of PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Here we
      investigated the genetic diversity of the pfhrp2 gene in clinical parasite
      isolates collected in recent years from the China-Myanmar border area. Deletion
      of pfhrp2 has been identified in 4 out of 97 parasite isolates. Sequencing of the
      pfhrp2 exon2 from 67 isolates revealed a high level of genetic diversity in
      pfhrp2, which is reflected in the presence of many repeat types and their
      variants, as well as variable copy numbers and different arrangements of these
      repeats in parasite isolates. In addition, we observed pfhrp3 deletion in three
      of the four parasites harboring pfhrp2 deletion, suggesting of double deletions
      of both genes in these three isolates. Analysis of two cases, which were P.
      falciparum-positive by microscopy and PCR but failed by two PfHRP2-based RDTs,
      did not find pfhrp2 deletion. Further correlational studies of pfhrp2
      polymorphisms with detection sensitivity are needed to identify factors
      influencing the performance of RDTs in malaria-endemic areas.

TI  - Chloroquine sensitivity: diminished prevalence of chloroquine-resistant gene
      marker pfcrt-76 13 years after cessation of chloroquine use in Msambweni, Kenya.
PG  - 328
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0850-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine (CQ) denied
      healthcare providers access to a cheap and effective anti-malarial drug.
      Resistance has been proven to be due to point mutations on the parasite's pfcrt
      gene, particularly on codon 76, resulting in an amino acid change from lysine to 
      threonine. This study sought to determine the prevalence of the pfcrt K76T
      mutation 13 years after CQ cessation in Msambweni, Kenya. METHODS: Finger-prick
      whole blood was collected on 3MM Whatman((R)) filter paper from 99 falciparum
      malaria patients. Parasite DNA was extracted via the Chelex method from
      individual blood spots and used as template in nested PCR amplification of pfcrt.
      Apo1 restriction enzyme was used to digest the amplified DNA to identify the
      samples as wild type or sensitive at codon 76. Prevalence figures of the mutant
      pfcrt 76T gene were calculated by dividing the number of samples bearing the
      mutant gene with the total number of samples multiplied by 100 %. Chi square
      tests were used to test the significance of the findings against previous
      prevalence figures. RESULTS: Out of 99 clinical samples collected in 2013,
      prevalence of the mutant pfcrt 76T gene stood at 41 %. CONCLUSION: The results
      indicate a significant [chi(2) test, P </= 0.05 (2006 vs 2013)] reversal to
      sensitivity by the P. falciparum population in the study site compared to the
      situation reported in 2006 at the same study site. This could primarily be driven
      by diminished use of CQ in the study area in line with the official policy.
      Studies to establish prevalence of the pfcrt 76T gene could be expanded
      countrywide to establish the CQ sensitivity status and predict a date when CQ may
      be re-introduced as part of malaria chemotherapy.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin has emerged in the Greater Mekong
      Subregion and now poses a threat to malaria control and prevention. Recent work
      has identified mutations in the kelch propeller domain of the P. falciparum K13
      gene to be associated artemisinin resistance as defined by delayed parasite
      clearance and ex vivo ring stage survival assays. Species specific primers for
      the two most prevalent human malaria species, P. falciparum and P. vivax, were
      designed and tested on multiple parasite isolates including human, rodent, and
      non- humans primate Plasmodium species. The new protocol described here using the
      species specific primers only amplified their respective species, P. falciparum
      and P. vivax, and did not cross react with any of the other human malaria
      Plasmodium species. We provide an improved species specific PCR and sequencing
      protocol that could be effectively used in areas where both P. falciparum and P. 
      vivax are circulating. To design this improved protocol, the kelch gene was
      analyzed and compared among different species of Plasmodium. The kelch propeller 
      domain was found to be highly conserved across the mammalian Plasmodium species.

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of artemether-lumefantrine versus artesunate-amodiaquine
      for unsupervised treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in patients of all
      age groups in Nanoro, Burkina Faso: a randomized open label trial.
PG  - 325
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0843-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported high efficacy and safety of
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) mostly under strict supervision of
      drug intake and limited to children less than 5 years of age. Patients over 5
      years of age are usually not involved in such studies. Thus, the findings do not 
      fully reflect the reality in the field. This study aimed to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of ACT in routine treatment of uncomplicated malaria
      among patients of all age groups in Nanoro, Burkina Faso. METHODS: A randomized
      open label trial comparing artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was carried out from September 2010 to October 2012 
      at two primary health centres (Nanoro and Nazoanga) of Nanoro health district. A 
      total of 680 patients were randomized to receive either ASAQ or AL without any
      distinction by age. Drug intake was not supervised as pertains in routine
      practice in the field. Patients or their parents/guardians were advised on the
      time and mode of administration for the 3 days treatment unobserved at home.
      Follow-up visits were performed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to evaluate clinical
      and parasitological resolution of their malaria episode as well as adverse
      events. PCR genotyping of merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp-1, msp-2) was
      used to differentiate recrudescence and new infection. RESULTS: By day 28, the
      PCR corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response was 84.1 and 77.8 % 
      respectively for ASAQ and AL. The cure rate was higher in older patients than in 
      children under 5 years old. The risk of re-infection by day 28 was higher in AL
      treated patients compared with those receiving ASAQ (p < 0.00001). Both AL and
      ASAQ treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study shows a lowering of
      the efficacy when drug intake is not directly supervised. This is worrying as
      both rates are lower than the critical threshold of 90 % required by the WHO to
      recommend the use of an anti-malarial drug in a treatment policy. TRIAL

TI  - Anopheles stephensi p38 MAPK signaling regulates innate immunity and
      bioenergetics during Plasmodium falciparum infection.
PG  - 424

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit flies and mammals protect themselves against infection by
      mounting immune and metabolic responses that must be balanced against the
      metabolic needs of the pathogens. In this context, p38 mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling is critical to regulating both innate immunity 
      and metabolism during infection. Accordingly, we asked to what extent the Asian
      malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi utilizes p38 MAPK signaling during infection
      with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: A. stephensi p38 
      MAPK (AsP38 MAPK) was identified and patterns of signaling in vitro and in vivo
      (midgut) were analyzed using phospho-specific antibodies and small molecule
      inhibitors. Functional effects of AsP38 MAPK inhibition were assessed using P.
      falciparum infection, quantitative real-time PCR, assays for reactive oxygen
      species and survivorship under oxidative stress, proteomics, and biochemical
      analyses. RESULTS: The genome of A. stephensi encodes a single p38 MAPK that is
      activated in the midgut in response to parasite infection. Inhibition of AsP38
      MAPK signaling significantly reduced P. falciparum sporogonic development. This
      phenotype was associated with AsP38 MAPK regulation of mitochondrial physiology
      and stress responses in the midgut epithelium, a tissue critical for parasite
      development. Specifically, inhibition of AsP38 MAPK resulted in reduction in
      mosquito protein synthesis machinery, a shift in glucose metabolism, reduced
      mitochondrial metabolism, enhanced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
      species, induction of an array of anti-parasite effector genes, and decreased
      resistance to oxidative stress-mediated damage. Hence, P. falciparum-induced
      activation of AsP38 MAPK in the midgut facilitates parasite infection through a
      combination of reduced anti-parasite immune defenses and enhanced host protein
      synthesis and bioenergetics to minimize the impact of infection on the host and
      to maximize parasite survival, and ultimately, transmission. CONCLUSIONS: These
      observations suggest that, as in mammals, innate immunity and mitochondrial
      responses are integrated in mosquitoes and that AsP38 MAPK-dependent signaling
      facilitates mosquito survival during parasite infection, a fact that may attest
      to the relatively longer evolutionary relationship of these parasites with their 
      invertebrate compared to their vertebrate hosts. On a practical level, improved
      understanding of the balances and trade-offs between resistance and metabolism
      could be leveraged to generate fit, resistant mosquitoes for malaria control.

TI  - Sleeping on the floor decreases insecticide treated bed net use and increases
      risk of malaria in children under 5 years of age in Mbita District, Kenya.
PG  - 1516-22
LID - 10.1017/S0031182015000955 [doi]
AB  - Children who sleep on the floor are less likely to use long-lasting insecticidal 
      nets (LLINs); however, the relationship between sleeping location and Plasmodium 
      falciparum infection has not been investigated sufficiently. This study revealed 
      whether sleeping location (bed vs floor) is associated with P. falciparum
      infection among children 7-59 months old. More than 60% of children slept on the 
      floor. Younger children were significantly more likely to sleep in beds [odds
      ratio, OR 2.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02-2.67)]. Nearly 70% of children 
      slept under LLINs the previous night. LLIN use among children who slept on the
      floor was significantly less than ones sleeping in beds [OR 0.49 (95% CI
      0.35-0.68)]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based P. falciparum infection
      rate and slide based infection rate were 65.2 and 29.7%, respectively. Both
      infections were significantly higher among children slept on the floor [OR1.51
      (95% CI 1.08-2.10) for PCR base, OR 1.62 (95% CI 1.14-2.30) for slide base] while
      net availability was not significant. Sleeping location was also significant for 
      slide based infection with fever ( 37.5 degrees C) [2.03 (95% CI 1.14-3.84)] and 
      high parasitemia cases (parasite 2500 microL(-1)) [2.07 (95% CI 1.03-4.50)]. The 
      results suggest that sleeping location has a direct bearing on the effectiveness 
      of LLINs.

TI  - Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Southwestern Ethiopia.
PG  - 317
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0826-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development and spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium
      falciparum threatens the health of millions of people and poses a major challenge
      to the control of malaria. Monitoring drug efficacy in 2-year intervals is an
      important tool for establishing rational anti-malarial drug policies. This study 
      addresses the therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the
      treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: A 28-day in
      vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from September to December, 2011,
      in southwestern Ethiopia. Participants were selected for the study if they were
      older than 6 months, weighed more than 5 kg, symptomatic, and had microscopically
      confirmed, uncomplicated P. falciparum. All 93 eligible patients were treated
      with AL and followed for 28 days. For each patient, recurrence of parasitaemia,
      the clinical condition, and the presence of gametoytes were assessed on each
      visit during the follow-up period. PCR was conducted to differentiate
      re-infection from recrudescence. RESULTS: Seventy-four (83.1 %) of the study
      subjects cleared fever by day 1, but five (5.6 %) had fever at day 2. All study
      subjects cleared fever by day 3. Seventy-nine (88.8 %) of the study subjects
      cleared the parasite by day 1, seven (7.9 %) were blood-smear positive by day 1, 
      and three (3.4 %) were positive by day 2. In five patients (5.6 %), parasitaemia 
      reappeared during the 28-day follow-up period. From these five, one (1.1 %) was a
      late clinical failure, and four (4.5 %) were a late parasitological failure. On
      the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine
      (CQ-DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (>100 ng/ml) in one
      patient. There were 84 (94.4 %) adequate clinical and parasitological responses. 
      The 28-day, PCR-uncorrected (unadjusted by genotyping) cure rate was 84 (94.4 %),
      whereas the 28-day, PCR-corrected cure rate was 87 (97.8 %). Of the three
      re-infections, two (2.2 %) were due to P. falciparum and one (1.1 %) was due to
      P. vivax. From 89 study subjects, 12 (13.5 %) carried P. falciparum gametocytes
      at day 0, whereas the 28-day gametocyte carriage rate was 2 (2.2 %). CONCLUSIONS:
      Years after the introduction of AL in Ethiopia, the finding of this study is that
      AL has been highly effective in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria and reducing gametocyte carriage in southwestern Ethiopia.

TI  - On-going malaria transmission in The Gambia despite high coverage of control
      interventions: a nationwide cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0829-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As indicators of burden of malaria have substantially decreased in
      The Gambia, reaching a pre-elimination status may be attainable. Achieving this
      goal requires in-depth understanding of the current burden of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted 
      in 2012 to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infection, and to describe
      its heterogeneity and associated risk factors. Finger-prick blood samples were
      collected for microscopy, species-specific PCR and haemoglobin measurement.
      RESULTS: A total of 9,094 participants were included and median age was 11.9
      years (IQR 5, 28). Overall prevalence of P. falciparum was 16.01 % with marked
      heterogeneity between sites (4.32-36.75 %) and within villages in each site
      (1.63-49.13 %). Across all sites, 51.17 % (745/1,456) of infections were
      asymptomatic and 35.61 % (448/1,258) were sub-microscopic. The odds of P.
      falciparum infection were higher in older children; 5-15 years (OR = 1.90; 95 %
      CI 1.60-2.26), adults (OR = 1.48; 95 % CI 1.24-1.78) and participants with
      moderate anaemia (OR = 1.62; 95 % CI 1.32-1.99). CONCLUSIONS: The current malaria
      control interventions are not sufficient to interrupt transmission in The Gambia 
      as malaria prevalence is still relatively high in the eastern part of the
      country. New interventions aiming at interrupting transmission are needed and
      should be urgently evaluated.

AB  - Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) and pregnancy malaria (PM) have been individually
      reported to cause severe negative outcomes in pregnancies but the diagnostic
      method is still debatable. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of PM and
      CT single and co-infections in pregnant women by using various specimens
      including plasma and placental tissues. Genomic DNA extracted from the placenta, 
      cord blood or blood of mothers was tested by PCR. Conventional method of
      immunodiagnosis was done for CT. We tested 79 pregnant women aged 18-42 years
      (mean: 28+/-1.06). Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection determined by
      PCR on mother's peripheral blood specimen was 6.3% whiles 57.3% was recorded for 
      placental tissues (p<0.01). PCR testing for placental tissues showed 29.2%
      positive for Toxoplasma gondii, whiles 76.0% of mothers had serum IgG against T. 
      gondii. It should be noted that 6.3% of the placental tissues showed PCR positive
      for SAG 3, a marker of active infection in T. gondii. Although there were no
      enhanced foetal disorders at birth in our study, there is a possibility of active
      transmission of T. gondii from mothers to foetuses even in immune mothers. Our
      study suggests that foetuses were exposed to P. falciparum and T. gondii in
      utero, and placenta is a better specimen for PCR in detecting such episodes. In
      cases of PCR-positive samples, clinical follow-up after birth may be important.

TI  - Therapeutic assessment of chloroquine-primaquine combined regimen in adult cohort
      of Plasmodium vivax malaria from a tertiary care hospital in southwestern India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and
      chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast
      Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy
      of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated
      P. vivax mono-infection. METHODS: A tertiary care hospital-based prospective
      study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as
      per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of
      anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg
      body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks. 
      RESULTS: Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28
      follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients
      (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum
      infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects
      (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day
      3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one
      therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever
      and parasitaemia. CONCLUSIONS: CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly
      effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment 
      of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible
      resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.

AB  - Most febrile patients are often misdiagnosed with malaria due to similar
      symptoms, such as fever shared by malaria and certain arboviral infections. This 
      study surveyed the incidence of malaria, chikungunya and dengue infections among 
      a number of suspected febrile patients visiting Simawa Health Centre, Ogun State,
      Nigeria. Venous blood samples were obtained from 60 febrile patients (age 3-70
      years) visiting the centre between April and May 2014. The rapid diagnostic test 
      (RDT) was used to detect the presence of chikungunya (CHK) antibodies (IgM),
      dengue (DEN) virus and antibodies (NS1, IgM and IgG) and malaria parasites
      (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax). Malarial confirmatory tests were by
      microscopy and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the polymorphic
      region of Glutamate-Rich Protein (GLURP) gene. The complexity of P. falciparum
      infection in the community also determined by the use of nested PCR. These three 
      mosquito-borne infections were observed in 63% (38) of the patients. The
      prevalence of CHK, DEN and malarial infections singularly were 11%, 0% and 63%,
      respectively, whereas malaria with either CHK or DEN infections were 24% (9) and 
      3% (1), respectively. No subjects were positive for CHK and DEN co-infection.
      Malarial microscopic confirmation was in 94% (32) of the malaria RDT-positive
      samples, 50% (17) were successfully analysed by nested PCR and the mean
      multiplicity of infection was 1.6 (1-3 clones). One patient sample harboured both
      P. falciparum and P. vivax. The study reports the presence of some arboviral
      infections having similar symptoms with malaria at Simawa, Ogun State. The proper
      diagnosis of infectious diseases is important for controlling them.

TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency among malaria patients of Honduras: 
      a descriptive study of archival blood samples.
PG  - 308
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0823-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of deficient variants of glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PDd) is particularly high in areas where malaria is endemic. The
      administration of antirelapse drugs, such as primaquine, has the potential to
      trigger an oxidative event in G6PD-deficient individuals. According to Honduras
      national scheme, malaria treatment requires the administration of chloroquine and
      primaquine for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections. The
      present study aimed at investigating for the first time in Honduras the frequency
      of the two most common G6PDd variants. METHODS: This was a descriptive study
      utilizing 398 archival DNA samples of patients that had been diagnosed with
      malaria due to P. vivax, P. falciparum, or both. The most common allelic variants
      of G6PD: G6PD A+(376G) and G6PD A-(376G/202A) were assessed by two molecular
      methods (PCR-RFLP and a commercial kit). RESULTS: The overall frequency of G6PD
      deficient genotypes was 16.08%. The frequency of the "African" genotype A- (Class
      III) was 11.9% (4.1% A- hemizygous males; 1.5% homozygous A- females; and 6.3%
      heterozygous A- females). A high frequency of G6PDd alleles was observed in
      samples from malaria patients residing in endemic regions of Northern Honduras.
      One case of Santamaria mutation (376G/542T) was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared
      to other studies in the Americas, as well as to data from predictive models, the 
      present study identified a higher-than expected frequency of genotype A- in
      Honduras. Considering that the national standard of malaria treatment in the
      country includes primaquine, further research is necessary to ascertain the risk 
      of PQ-triggered haemolytic reactions in sectors of the population more likely to 
      carry G6PD mutations. Additionally, consideration should be given to utilizing
      point of care technologies to detect this genetic disorder prior administration
      of 8-aminoquinoline drugs, either primaquine or any new drug available in the
      near future.

TI  - [Establishment and Application of Multiplex PCR System for Detecting Four Human
      Plasmodium Species].
PG  - 91-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a multiplex PCR detection system for identifying 4 human 
      Plasmodium species and evaluate its applicability. METHODS: The sequences of 18S 
      rDNA gene of the 4 human Plasmodium species were compared using DNAman software, 
      and 4 downstream primers were designed using Oligo 6.0 software, which targeted
      the region of variability between conserved regions 5 and 6 of the sequences.
      Using these primers, the specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR system 
      were evaluated, with plasmids containing the 18S rDNA gene sequence as a
      template. Further, a new nest PCR system (M-Nest) was established by combining
      the multiplex PCR system with the first-cycle genus-specific primer of the
      NP-1993 system. The sensitivities of the multiplex PCR system and the M-nest
      system were evaluated in serial dilutions of blood DNA samples from patients
      infected by P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, the NP-1993 and M-Nest
      systems were applied to screen the Plasmodium species in 307 blood samples from
      people returning to Guangxi from Ghana, a malaria epidemic area. And the NP-2002 
      and M-Nest systems were applied to re-check Plasmodium species in 66 blood
      samples collected in Guangxi from 2014 January to May, which were identified by
      microscopy to be infected mainly by P. ovale. RESULTS: The sizes of multiplex PCR
      products for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae were 268 bp, 323 
      bp, 394 bp, and 446 bp, respectively, located in-between 50-bp DNA ladders.
      However, their melting curves had similar Tm values, thus could not be used to
      identify the 4 species. The minimum detection limits of P. falciparum, P.
      malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax 18S rDNA gene by the multiplex PCR system were
      5.58x102, 1.56x103, 1.66x103, and 1.80 x 10(2) copies/[A. The minimum detection
      limit of blood DNA from falciparum malaria patients by the multiplex PCR system
      was 1.43 x 10(2)-8.84 x 10(3) copies/p.1 or 5.10 x 10-4.92 x 10(2)
      parasites/microl, higher than that of P. vivax (17.4-69.1 copies/L or 13.5-83.2
      parasites/p). Compared with this multiples PCR system, The M-Nest system further 
      reduced the minimum detection limit of Plasmodium by 10-100 folds. Further, the
      M-Nest and NP-1993 systems reached inconsistent detection results in 307 blood
      samples from people returned to from Ghana; the former detected 2 cases of P.
      ovale infection while the latter failed. In addition, the NP-2002 and M-Nest
      systems came to the same results in re-checking Plasmodium species in the 66
      blood samples. CONCLUSION: The established multiplex PCR system can identify 4
      human Plasmodium species simultaneously and has good applicability in practice.

TI  - Microscopic and molecular evidence of the presence of asymptomatic Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections in an area with low, seasonal and
      unstable malaria transmission in Ethiopia.
PG  - 310
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-1070-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of asymptomatic infections has serious implications for 
      malaria elimination campaigns. Since asymptomatic carriers do not seek treatment 
      for their infection and may become gametocyte carriers, they undoubtedly
      contribute to the persistence of malaria transmission in a population. The
      presence of asymptomatic parasitemias was noted in areas with seasonal malaria
      transmission. In Ethiopia there is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of 
      asymptomatic malaria carriage. This study was undertaken to assess the presence
      and prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      infections in south-central Oromia, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 1094 apparently
      healthy individuals >/= 2 years of age in south-central Oromia, Ethiopia, an area
      with seasonal and unstable malaria transmission, were screened for the presence
      of asymptomatic plasmodial infections. Finger-prick blood samples were taken from
      each participant for blood film preparation for microscopy and the rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT). Blood samples were also spotted on Whatman 3MM filter
      paper for parasite DNA extraction. RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic
      Plasmodium carriage (P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed species) was 5.0 %
      (55/1,094) as determined by microscopy, while the prevalence as determined using 
      RDT was 8.2 % (90/1,094). PCR was done on 47 of 55 microscopy-confirmed and on 79
      of 90 RDT-confirmed samples. PCR detected parasite DNA in 89.4 % (42/47) of the
      microscopy-positive samples and in 77.2 % (61/79) of the RDT-positive samples. No
      significant difference was observed in the prevalence of asymptomatic P.
      falciparum or P. vivax infections in the study area (P > 0.1). However, the
      prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia was significantly associated with gender 
      (OR = 0.47, P = 0.015; being higher in males than females) and age (X(2) = 25, P 
      < 0.001; being higher in younger than in older individuals). Age and parasite
      densities had an inverse relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the
      presence of asymptomatic P. falciparum and P. vivax infections in south-central
      Oromia, an area with low, seasonal and unstable malaria transmission in Ethiopia.
      Of 55 microscopically confirmed asymptomatic infections, P. falciparum
      monoinfection accounted for 45.5 % and of 90 RDT positive asymptomatic
      infections, 66.7 % were P. falciparum. Although not statistically significant, P.
      falciparum accounted for a relatively large number of the asymptomatic infections
      as determined by both tests. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia was
      highest in the younger age group. HRP-2-based RDTs specific for P. falciparum
      showed high false positivity rate compared to Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase
      (pLDH) specific to P. vivax. Although microscopy and RDT detected substantial
      numbers of asymptomatic infections in apparently healthy inhabitants, the use of 
      a highly sensitive molecular diagnostics offers a more accurate assessment of the
      magnitude of asymptomatic infections.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 block 2 gene polymorphism in
      field isolates along the slope of mount Cameroon: a cross - sectional study.
PG  - 309
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-1066-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major global health burden despite the
      intensification of control efforts, due partly to the lack of an effective
      vaccine. Information on genetic diversity in natural parasite populations
      constitutes a major impediment to vaccine development efforts and is limited in
      some endemic settings. The present study characterized diversity by investigating
      msp1 block 2 polymorphisms and the relationship between the allele families with 
      ethnodemographic indices and clinical phenotype. METHOD: Individuals with
      asymptomatic parasitaemia (AP) or uncomplicated malaria (UM) were enrolled from
      rural, semi-rural and semi-urban localities at varying altitudes along the slope 
      of mount Cameroon. P. falciparum malaria parasitaemic blood screened by light
      microscopy was depleted of leucocytes using CF11 cellulose columns and the
      parasite DNA genotyped by nested PCR. RESULTS: Length polymorphism was assessed
      in 151 field isolates revealing 64 (5) and 274 (22) distinct recombinant and
      major msp1 allelic fragments (genotypes) respectively. All family specific
      allelic types (K1, MAD20 and RO33) as well as MR were observed in the different
      locations, with K1 being most abundant. Eighty seven (60 %) of individuals
      harbored more than one parasite clone, with a significant proportion (p = 0.009) 
      in rural compared to other settings. AP individuals had higher (p = 0.007) K1
      allele frequencies but lower (p = 0.003) mean multiplicity of genotypes per
      infection (2.00 +/- 0.98 vs. 2.56 +/- 1.17) compared to UM patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results indicate enormous diversity of P. falciparum in the area and
      suggests that allele specificity and complexity may be relevant for the
      progression to symptomatic disease.

TI  - Submicroscopic carriage of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in a low
      endemic area in Ethiopia where no parasitaemia was detected by microscopy or
      rapid diagnostic test.
PG  - 303
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0821-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motivated by the success in malaria control that was documented over 
      the last decade Ethiopia is aiming at malaria elimination by 2020 in selected
      districts. It is currently unknown if asymptomatic, submicroscopic malaria
      parasite carriage may form a hurdle to achieve elimination. The elimination
      effort may further be complicated by possible glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase
      (G6PD) deficiency which would hinder the use of 8-aminoquinolines in the
      elimination efforts. METHOD: In February 2014 a community-based cross-sectional
      survey was conducted in Malo, southwest Ethiopia. Finger-prick blood samples (n =
      555) were tested for presence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax with 
      microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and nested polymerase chain reaction
      (nPCR). Multiplicity of P. falciparum infections was determined based on
      genotyping the polymorphic merozoite surface protein-2 (MSP-2) gene. Individuals 
      were also genotyped for mutations in the gene that produces G6PD. RESULTS: All
      study participants were malaria infection negative by microscopy and RDT. Nested 
      PCR revealed P. falciparum mono-infection in 5.2% (29/555), P. vivax
      mono-infection in 4.3% (24/555) and mixed infection in 0.2% (1/555) of
      individuals. All parasitemic individuals were afebrile (axillary temperature
      <37.5 degrees C). None of the study participants carried mutations for the G6PD
      African A-(202GA) and Mediterranean (563CT) variants. All infections, except one,
      were single-clone infection by MSP-2 genotyping. CONCLUSION: The detection of a
      substantial number of subpatent malaria infections in an apparently asymptomatic 
      population without evidence for malaria transmission by conventional diagnostics 
      raises questions about the path to malaria elimination. It is currently unknown
      how important these infections are for sustaining malaria transmission in the
      study sites. The absence of G6PD deficiency indicates that 8-aminoquinolines may 
      be safely deployed to accelerate elimination initiatives.

TI  - Temporal trends in prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum molecular markers selected
      for by artemether-lumefantrine treatment in pre-ACT and post-ACT parasites in
      western Kenya.
PG  - 92-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpddr.2015.05.005 [doi]
AB  - Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) became the first-line treatment for uncomplicated
      malaria in Kenya in 2006. Studies have shown AL selects for SNPs in pfcrt and
      pfmdr1 genes in recurring parasites compared to the baseline infections. The
      genotypes associated with AL selection are K76 in pfcrt and N86, 184F and D1246
      in pfmdr1. To assess the temporal change of these genotypes in western Kenya, 47 
      parasite isolates collected before (pre-ACT; 1995-2003) and 745 after (post-ACT; 
      2008-2014) introduction of AL were analyzed. In addition, the associations of
      parasite haplotype against the IC50 of artemether and lumefantrine, and clearance
      rates were determined. Parasite genomic DNA collected between 1995 and 2014 was
      analyzed by sequencing or PCR-based single-base extension on Sequenom MassARRAY. 
      IC50s were determined for a subset of the samples. One hundred eighteen samples
      from 2013 to 2014 were from an efficacy trial of which 68 had clearance
      half-lives. Data revealed there were significant differences between pre-ACT and 
      post-ACT genotypes at the four codons (chi-square analysis; p < 0.0001). The
      prevalence of pfcrt K76 and N86 increased from 6.4% in 1995-1996 to 93.2% in 2014
      and 0.0% in 2002-2003 to 92.4% in 2014 respectively. Analysis of parasites
      carrying pure alleles of K + NFD or T + YYY haplotypes revealed that 100.0% of
      the pre-ACT parasites carried T + YYY and 99.3% of post-ACT parasites carried K +
      NFD. There was significant correlation (p = 0.04) between lumefantrine IC50 and
      polymorphism at pfmdr1 codon 184. There was no difference in parasite clearance
      half-lives based on genetic haplotype profiles. This study shows there is a
      significant change in parasite genotype, with key molecular determinants of AL
      selection almost reaching saturation. The implications of these findings are not 
      clear since AL remains highly efficacious. However, there is need to closely
      monitor parasite genotypic, phenotypic and clinical dynamics in response to
      continued use of AL in western Kenya.

TI  - Malaria in Poland in 2013.
PG  - 273-5, 385-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the epidemiological situation of imported malaria in
      Poland in 2013 compared to the data from previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      The assessment was performed based on the results of the analysis of individual
      reports sent to the NIPH-NIH by sanitary-epidemiological stations and aggregated 
      data published in the annual bulletins "Infectious diseases and poisonings in
      Poland". Cases were registered according to the case definition criteria
      applicable in the EU countries. RESULTS: In 2013, a total of 36 imported malaria 
      cases were registered in Poland, 15 more than in 2012. No deaths were recorded.
      As much as 80% of all cases were imported from African countries, of whom the
      majority came from Nigeria, 14% from Asia and 6% from South America. Concurrent
      infection with dengue virus was confirmed in one person coming back from
      Philippines. Plasmodium species was determined in 35 of 36 cases by blood film or
      PCR test. Invasion with P. falciparum and P. vivax was found in 23 (66%) and 9
      (26%) cases, respectively. There was also one case of each of the following: P.
      ovale, P. malariae and mixed invasion. As in previous years, in most cases, the
      invasion was associated with tourist trips (47%) or work-related travels (36%).
      Immigrants or students visiting the country of origin accounted for 11% of
      patients, in two cases (6%) purpose of the journey was not determined. As many as
      7 patients used chemoprophylaxis, including two persons who took drugs in
      compliance with the recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant increase 
      in the number of cases compared to previous years, the total number of imported
      malaria remains low. Persistent large number of delays in the diagnosis and a
      high percentage of severe malaria cases indicate the need to raise doctors
      awareness of the possibility of malaria incidence. Travelers should be also
      constantly reminded of the need to inform their GPs about the stay in the malaria
      endemic areas in the event of fever after returning.

TI  - Genetic evidence for contribution of human dispersal to the genetic diversity of 
      EBA-175 in Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 293
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0820-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 175-kDa erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175) of Plasmodium
      falciparum plays a crucial role in merozoite invasion into human erythrocytes.
      EBA-175 is believed to have been under diversifying selection; however, there
      have been no studies investigating the effect of dispersal of humans out of
      Africa on the genetic variation of EBA-175 in P. falciparum. METHODS: The
      PCR-direct sequencing was performed for a part of the eba-175 gene (regions II
      and III) using DNA samples obtained from Thai patients infected with P.
      falciparum. The divergence times for the P. falciparum eba-175 alleles were
      estimated assuming that P. falciparum/Plasmodium reichenowi divergence occurred 6
      million years ago (MYA). To examine the possibility of diversifying selection,
      nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates for Plasmodium species were also 
      estimated. RESULTS: A total of 32 eba-175 alleles were identified from 131 Thai
      P. falciparum isolates. Their estimated divergence time was 0.13-0.14 MYA, before
      the exodus of humans from Africa. A phylogenetic tree for a large sequence
      dataset of P. falciparum eba-175 alleles from across the world showed the
      presence of a basal Asian-specific cluster for all P. falciparum sequences. A
      markedly more nonsynonymous substitutions than synonymous substitutions in region
      II in P. falciparum was also detected, but not within Plasmodium species
      parasitizing African apes, suggesting that diversifying selection has acted
      specifically on P. falciparum eba-175. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum eba-175
      genetic diversity appeared to increase following the exodus of Asian ancestors
      from Africa. Diversifying selection may have played an important role in the
      diversification of eba-175 allelic lineages. The present results suggest that the
      dispersals of humans out of Africa influenced significantly the molecular
      evolution of P. falciparum EBA-175.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of RDTs against nested polymerase chain
      reaction (nPCR) for the diagnosis of malaria in public health facilities in
      north-western Ethiopia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study at public health
      facilities in North Gondar, Ethiopia, of 359 febrile patients with signs and
      symptoms consistent with malaria. Finger prick blood samples were collected for
      testing in a P. falciparum/pan-malaria RDTs and for molecular analysis.
      Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined for the RDTs using
      nPCR as reference diagnostic method. Kappa value was determined to demonstrate
      the consistency of the results between the diagnostic tools. RESULTS: By RDTs,
      22.28% (80/359) of patients tested positive for malaria, and by nPCR, 27.02%
      (97/359) did. In nPCR, 1.67% (6/359) and 0.28% (1/359) samples were positive for 
      P. ovale and P. malariae, which had almost all tested negative in the RDTs. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of RDTs for the
      diagnosis of malaria were 62.9%, 92.7%, 76.3% and 87.1%, respectively, with 0.589
      measurement agreement between RDTs and nPCR. The sensitivity and specificity of
      RDTs for P. falciparum identification only were 70.8% and 95.2%, and 65.2% and
      93.1% for P. vivax. CONCLUSION: Although RDTs are commonly used at health posts
      in resource-limited environments, their sensitivity and specificity for the
      detection and species identification of Plasmodium parasites were poor compared
      to nPCR, suggesting caution in interpreting RDTs results. Particularly, in the
      light of expanded efforts to eliminate malaria in the country, more sensitive
      diagnostic procedures will be needed.

AB  - Long term use of insecticides in malaria vector control has been shown to alter
      the behavior of vectors. Such behavioral shifts have the potential of undermining
      the effectiveness of insecticide-based control interventions. The effects of
      insecticide treated nets (ITNs) use on the composition, biting/feeding and
      sporozoite rates of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in Musilongo village,
      Vihiga County of western Kenya highlands were investigated. Adult mosquitoes were
      collected in selected sleeping spaces inside six randomly selected houses using
      miniature Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps. Mosquito
      sampling in each house was conducted twice every week for 16 consecutive months
      (May 2010-August 2012). At each sampling a single trap was set in the selected
      space inside each house such that it collected mosquitoes alternatively from
      18:00 to 21:00h and 21:00 to 06:00h every week. All collected mosquitoes were
      morphologically identified. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were classified according
      to their physiological status as unfed, fed, partially gravid and gravid, sorted 
      and counted. Members of the A. gambiae complex were identified using a Polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) method. Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used
      to determine blood meal sources and Plasmodium infection rates in A. gambiae s.l.
      mosquitoes. Blood meal tests were conducted on DNA extracted from gut contents of
      blood fed A. gambiae s.l. The head and thorax section of dried samples of A.
      gambiae s.l. were used in testing for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) 
      sporozoites. Overall, 735 adult female Anopheles comprising 708 [96.3%] A.
      gambiae s.l. and 27 [3.7%] Anopheles funestus mosquitoes were collected. A.
      gambiae s.l. population collected comprised, 615 [86.9%] unfed and 38 [5.4%] fed 
      adult mosquitoes. The rest were either partially or fully gravid. The proportion 
      of A. gambiae s.l. biting indoors within 18:00-21:00h was 15.8% (103/653) at a
      rate of 3.2bites per person per hour compared to 84.2% biting from 21:00-06:00h
      at a rate of 3.8 bites/per/h. An estimated 97.7% A. gambiae ss and 2.3% A.
      arabiensis constituted the indoor biting A. gambiae s.l. The population of An.
      gambiae s.l. biting from 18:00 to 21:00h had a Plasmodium faciparum (pf)
      sporozoite rate of 3.8% compared to 3.5% observed in populations biting within
      21:00-06:00h. Human blood constituted 89% of An. gambiae s.l. blood meal sources.
      The risk of malaria transmission from 21:00 to 06:00h was approximately 5 fold
      the risk within 18:00-21:00h. Majority of the infective female A. gambiae s.l.
      adults were biting deep into the night than in the early hours of the night.
      Humans remain the preferred source of blood meal for A. gambiae s.s. the dominant
      malaria vector in the highlands. ITNs remain a fundamental control intervention
      against malaria transmission since female blood seekers were more during bed time
      than pre-bed time. Advocacy on enhanced net availability, integrity and usage in 
      Kenyan highlands can reduce Pf transmission. Additional complementary
      interventions are required to control the biting and parasite transmission
      encountered before bed-time.

TI  - School-Age Children Are a Reservoir of Malaria Infection in Malawi.
PG  - e0134061
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134061 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Malaria surveillance and interventions in endemic countries often
      target young children at highest risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. We
      aimed to determine whether school-age children and adults not captured in
      surveillance serve as a reservoir for malaria infection and may contribute to
      malaria transmission. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in one rainy and one
      dry season in southern Malawi. Demographic and health information was collected
      for all household members. Blood samples were obtained for microscopic and PCR
      identification of Plasmodium falciparum. Among 5796 individuals aged greater than
      six months, PCR prevalence of malaria infection was 5%, 10%, and 20% in dry, and 
      9%, 15%, and 32% in rainy seasons in Blantyre, Thyolo, and Chikhwawa,
      respectively. Over 88% of those infected were asymptomatic. Participants aged
      6-15 years were at higher risk of infection (OR=4.8; 95%CI, 4.0-5.8) and
      asymptomatic infection (OR=4.2; 95%CI, 2.7-6.6) than younger children in all
      settings. School-age children used bednets less frequently than other age groups.
      Compared to young children, school-age children were brought less often for
      treatment and more often to unreliable treatment sources. CONCLUSION: School-age 
      children represent an underappreciated reservoir of malaria infection and have
      less exposure to antimalarial interventions. Malaria control and elimination
      strategies may need to expand to include this age group.

TI  - Absence of correlation between ex vivo susceptibility to doxycycline and
      pfteQ-pfmdt gene polymorphism in French Guiana.
PG  - 286
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0788-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In French Guiana, doxycycline is used for both chemoprophylaxis and
      the treatment of malaria. The presence of isolates with reduced ex vivo
      susceptibility to doxycycline in French Guiana makes it critical to identify any 
      genetic determinants contributing to the chemosusceptibility level of Plasmodium 
      falciparum to doxycycline, such as pfmdt and pftetQ, which were recently
      identified as potential molecular markers in African isolates. METHODS: A
      Bayesian statistical approach was used to define different ex vivo doxycycline
      phenotypes. The pfmdt and pftetQ gene copy numbers were quantified by
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 129 P. falciparum isolates
      collected between 2000 and 2010, and pftetQ, pfrps7, pfssurRNA, and pflsurRNA
      sequences were analysed after amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: PftetQ and pfmdt copy numbers were not associated with reduced
      susceptibility to doxycycline in P. falciparum within French Guiana. Sequence
      analysis of the genes revealed five known single nucleotide polymorphisms. Three 
      new SNPs were identified in the apicoplast ribosomal RNA long sub-unit
      (pflsurRNA): C740T, A1875C and A1875T. These polymorphisms were not associated
      with reduced chemosusceptibility to doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      does not validate pfmdt and pftetQ genes as molecular markers of decreased
      susceptibility to doxycycline in P. falciparum isolates in French Guiana.

      submicroscopic gametocyte carriage in Gabonese pregnant women following IPTp-SP
      implementation.

AB  - This study analyzed the relationship between intermittent preventive treatment
      with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (IPTp-SP), the rate of multiple resistant
      parasites and of submicroscopic gametocyte carriage among pregnant women at the
      beginning of IPTp implementation in Gabon (2005) and six years after (2011). The 
      detection of pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutations was performed by PCR-RFLP in
      Plasmodium (P.) falciparum positive samples collected from pregnant women in 2005
      and 2011. Gametocytes carriage was detected by Pfs25mRNA amplification using
      QT-NASBA. Data were analyzed according to the time of collection (study period)
      and IPTp-SP doses. The proportion of isolates with at least a triple Pfdhfr
      mutation (n = 39/42, 92.9% versus 100%, n = 78/78)) and of those isolates with
      the S108N/C59R/N51I/S436A/A437G multiple mutation (17.9% versus 75.6%)
      significantly increased between 2005 and 2011 (p<0.01). Mutations I164L and A581G
      were not found, while higher proportions of 436 and 437 mutations were detected
      in 2011.A trend toward a higher frequency of isolates with five mutations was
      observed in women who received two SP doses (p<0.01). Pfs25mRNA was found in 6.8 
      % (n = 3/44) and 34.6% (n = 27/78) of the samples collected in 2005 and 2011
      respectively (p<0.01). In 2011, 74.0% (n = 20/27) of women with detected
      submicroscopic gametocytes carried parasites with the S108N/C59R/N51/S436A/A437G 
      multiple mutation. All the ten delivering women who received three IPTp-SP doses 
      had a submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infection, but none had detected
      gametocytes. Following IPTp-SP implementation, an increase in the frequency of
      multiple mutant parasites and of submicroscopic gametocyte carriage was observed 
      among pregnant women living in Gabon.

      Asymptomatic Infection in Lagos, Nigeria.
PG  - 436-43
LID - 10.1159/000430987 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess N51I, C59R and S108N polymorphisms of dihydrofolate
      reductase (dhfr) and A437G and K540E of dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes of 
      P. falciparum isolates recovered from pregnant women with asymptomatic malaria in
      a coastal setting in Nigeria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 consenting and
      consecutively enrolled pregnant women (mean age +/- standard deviation, 26.6 +/- 
      4.5 years) attending antenatal care at the Iru/Victoria Island Primary Health
      Centre, Lagos, were screened for peripheral malaria by microscopy, by a
      histidine-rich protein-2-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) using finger-pricked and dot blood samples. DNA was
      extracted from the blood and used for dhfr and dhps gene polymorphism analyses by
      PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The sociodemographic and
      parasite data obtained were analysed. RESULTS: Of the 107 patients, 34 (31.8%),
      46 (43%) and 40 (37.4%) were found to be P. falciparum infected using microscopy,
      RDT and corrected RDT-PCR, respectively (p < 0.05). The prevalence of P.
      falciparum isolates with mutant and mixed genotypes of dhfr at codons 51, 59 and 
      108 was 70, 75 and 80%, respectively, and the triple mutation in the homozygous
      form was 35%. The prevalence of the homozygous quintuple dhfr plus dhps mutant
      was 5%, while that of the P. falciparum isolates with mutant or mixed genotypes
      of dhps at codons 437 and 540 was 37.5 and 22.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This 
      study revealed the emergence of the K540E mutation among the parasite population 
      in Lagos. However, it supports the implementation of the intermittent preventive 
      treatment of malaria during pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine with
      continuous effectiveness monitoring in the study area.

TI  - A molecular survey of acute febrile illnesses reveals Plasmodium vivax infections
      in Kedougou, southeastern Senegal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Control efforts towards malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum
      significantly decreased the incidence of the disease in many endemic countries
      including Senegal. Surprisingly, in Kedougou (southeastern Senegal) P. falciparum
      malaria remains highly prevalent and the relative contribution of other
      Plasmodium species to the global malaria burden is very poorly documented, partly
      due to the low sensitivity of routine diagnostic tools. Molecular methods offer
      better estimate of circulating Plasmodium species in a given area. A molecular
      survey was carried out to document circulating malaria parasites in Kedougou
      region. METHODS: A total of 263 long-term stored sera obtained from patients
      presenting with acute febrile illness in Kedougou between July 2009 and July 2013
      were used for malaria parasite determination. Sera were withdrawn from a
      collection established as part of a surveillance programme of arboviruses
      infections in the region. Plasmodium species were characterized by a nested
      PCR-based approach targeting the 18S small sub-unit ribosomal RNA genes of
      Plasmodium spp. RESULTS: Of the 263 sera screened in this study, Plasmodium
      genomic DNA was amplifiable by nested PCR from 62.35% (164/263) of samples. P.
      falciparum accounted for the majority of infections either as single in 85.97%
      (141/164) of Plasmodium-positive samples or mixed with Plasmodium ovale (11.58%, 
      19/164) or Plasmodium vivax (1.21%, 2/164). All 19 (11.58%) P. ovale-infected
      patients were mixed with P. falciparum, while no Plasmodium malariae was detected
      in this survey. Four patients (2.43%) were found to be infected by P. vivax, two 
      of whom were mixed with P. falciparum. P. vivax infections originated from
      Bandafassi and Ninefesha villages and concerned patients aged 4, 9, 10, and 15
      years old, respectively. DNA sequences alignment and phylogenetic analysis
      demonstrated that sequences from Kedougou corresponded to P. vivax, therefore
      confirming the presence of P. vivax infections in Senegal. CONCLUSION: The
      results confirm the high prevalence of P. falciparum in Kedougou and provide the 
      first molecular evidence of P. vivax infections in Senegal. These findings pave
      the ways for further investigations of P. vivax infections in Senegal and its
      contribution to the global burden of malaria disease before targeted strategies
      can be deployed.

      from hemolytic blood samples - Short communication.
PG  - 159-63
LID - 10.1556/1886.2015.00006 [doi]
AB  - We compared the performance of an in-house and a commercial malaria polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) assay using freeze-thawed hemolytic blood samples. A total
      of 116 freeze-thawed ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples of
      patients with suspicion of malaria were analyzed by an in-house as well as by a
      commercially available real-time PCR. Concordant malaria negative PCR results
      were reported for 39 samples and malaria-positive PCR results for 67 samples. The
      in-house assay further detected one case of Plasmodium falciparum infection,
      which was negative in the commercial assay as well as five cases of P. falciparum
      malaria and three cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria, which showed sample
      inhibition in the commercial assay. The commercial malaria assay was positive in 
      spite of a negative in-house PCR result in one case. In all concordant results,
      cycle threshold values of P. falciparum-positive samples were lower in the
      commercial PCR than in the in-house assay. Although Ct values of the commercial
      PCR kit suggest higher sensitivity in case of concordant results, it is prone to 
      inhibition if it is applied to hemolytic freeze-thawed blood samples. The number 
      of misidentifications was, however, identical for both real-time PCR assays.

TI  - Humans frequently exposed to a range of non-human primate malaria parasite
      species through the bites of Anopheles dirus mosquitoes in South-central Vietnam.
PG  - 376
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-0995-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have described natural human infections of the
      non-human primate parasites Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium cynomolgi. In
      Southeast Asia, mosquitoes of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group bite both humans
      and monkeys in the forest and thus offer a possible route for Plasmodium species 
      to bridge the species barrier. In this study we analysed the species composition 
      of malarial sporozoites infecting the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus in order
      to determine their potential role as bridge vectors of Plasmodium parasites from 
      monkeys to humans. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected in the forest and forest
      fringe area of Khanh Phu commune by human-baited landing collection. Anopheles
      species were determined on the basis of morphologic features. Sporozoite-infected
      salivary glands were applied to filter paper and dried in an ambient atmosphere, 
      before storage in closed vials at 4-6 degrees C. Detection and identification of 
      Plasmodium species in salivary glands were carried out by nested-PCR of the small
      subunit ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: Six species of Plasmodium parasites were
      detected by PCR, of which P. vivax was the most common, followed by P. knowlesi, 
      P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi and P. falciparum. Twenty-six of the 79
      sporozoite infected mosquitoes showed multiple infections, most of which were a
      combination of P. vivax with one or more of the non-human primate Plasmodium
      species. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that humans overnighting in this
      forest are frequently inoculated with both human and non-human primate malaria
      parasites, leading to a situation conducive for the emergence of novel zoonotic
      malaria.

PG  - 265-70
LID - 10.3347/kjp.2015.53.3.265 [doi]
AB  - Hemoglobinopathy and malaria are commonly found worldwide particularly in malaria
      endemic areas. Thalassemia, the alteration of globin chain synthesis, has been
      reported to confer resistance against malaria. The prevalence of thalassemia was 
      investigated in 101 malaria patients with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax along the Thai-Myanmar border to examine protective effect of thalassemia
      against severe malaria. Hemoglobin typing was performed using low pressure liquid
      chromatography (LPLC) and alpha-thalassemia was confirmed by multiplex PCR. Five 
      types of thalassemia were observed in malaria patients. The 2 major types of
      thalassemia were Hb E (18.8%) and alpha-thalassemia-2 (11.9%). There was no
      association between thalassemia hemoglobinopathy and malaria parasitemia, an
      indicator of malaria disease severity. Thalassemia had no significant association
      with P. vivax infection, but the parasitemia in patients with coexistence of P.
      vivax and thalassemia was about 2-3 times lower than those with coexistence of P.
      falciparum and thalassemia and malaria without thalassemia. Furthermore, the
      parasitemia of P. vivax in patients with coexistence of Hb E showed lower value
      than coexistence with other types of thalassemia and malaria without coexistence.
      Parasitemia, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values in patients with coexistence of
      thalassemia other than Hb E were significantly lower than those without
      coexistence of thalassemia. Furthermore, parasitemia with coexistence of Hb E
      were 2 times lower than those with coexistence of thalassemia other than Hb E. In
      conclusion, the results may, at least in part, support the protective effect of
      thalassemia on the development of hyperparasitemia and severe anemia in malaria
      patients.

TI  - Identification of large variation in pfcrt, pfmdr-1 and pfubp-1 markers in
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Ethiopia and Tanzania.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0783-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to anti-malarials is a major
      drawback in effective malaria control and elimination globally.
      Artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is currently the key first-line treatment
      for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Plasmodium falciparum genetic signatures at
      pfmdr-1, pfcrt, and pfubp-1 loci are known to modulate in vivo and in vitro
      parasite response to ACT. The objective of this study was to assess the
      distribution of these resistance gene markers in isolates collected from
      different malaria transmission intensity in Ethiopia and Tanzania. METHODS:
      Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates were collected from different regions of 
      Ethiopia and Tanzania. Genetic polymorphisms in the genes pfcrt, pfmdr-1 and
      pfubp-1 were analysed by PCR and sequencing. Frequencies of the different alleles
      in the three genes were compared within and between regions, and between the two 
      countries. RESULTS: The majority of the isolates from Ethiopia were mutant for
      the pfcrt 76 and wild-type for pfmdr-1 86. In contrast, the majority of the
      Tanzanian samples were wild-type for both pfcrt and pfmdr-1 loci. Analysis of a
      variable linker region in pfmdr-1 showed substantial variation in isolates from
      Tanzania as compared to Ethiopian isolates that had minimal variation. Direct
      sequencing of the pfubp-1 region showed that 92.8% (26/28) of the Ethiopian
      isolates had identical genome sequence with the wild type reference P. falciparum
      strain 3D7. Of 42 isolates from Tanzania, only 13 (30.9%) had identical genome
      sequences with 3D7. In the Tanzanian samples, 10 variant haplotypes were
      identified. CONCLUSION: The majority of Ethiopian isolates carried the main
      marker for chloroquine (CQ) resistance, while the majority of the samples from
      Tanzania carried markers for CQ susceptibility. Polymorphic genes showed
      substantially more variation in Tanzanian isolates. The low variability in the
      polymorphic region of pfmdr-1 in Ethiopia may be a consequence of low
      transmission intensity as compared to high transmission intensity and large
      variations in Tanzania.

TI  - Deletion of Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (pfhrp2) and
      Histidine-Rich Protein 3 (pfhrp3) Genes in Colombian Parasites.
PG  - e0131576
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0131576 [doi]
AB  - A number of studies have analyzed the performance of malaria rapid diagnostic
      tests (RDTs) in Colombia with discrepancies in performance being attributed to a 
      combination of factors such as parasite levels, interpretation of RDT results
      and/or the handling and storage of RDT kits. However, some of the inconsistencies
      observed with results from Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2
      (PfHRP2)-based RDTs could also be explained by the deletion of the gene that
      encodes the protein, pfhrp2, and its structural homolog, pfhrp3, in some parasite
      isolates. Given that pfhrp2- and pfhrp3-negative P. falciparum isolates have been
      detected in the neighboring Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon regions, we
      hypothesized that parasites with deletions of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 may also be
      present in Colombia. In this study we tested 100 historical samples collected
      between 1999 and 2009 from six Departments in Colombia for the presence of
      pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and their flanking genes. Seven neutral microsatellites were also 
      used to determine the genetic background of these parasites. In total 18 of 100
      parasite isolates were found to have deleted pfhrp2, a majority of which (14 of
      18) were collected from Amazonas Department, which borders Peru and Brazil.
      pfhrp3 deletions were found in 52 of the 100 samples collected from all regions
      of the country. pfhrp2 flanking genes PF3D7_0831900 and PF3D7_0831700 were
      deleted in 22 of 100 and in 1 of 100 samples, respectively. pfhrp3 flanking genes
      PF3D7_1372100 and PF3D7_1372400 were missing in 55 of 100 and in 57 of 100
      samples. Structure analysis of microsatellite data indicated that Colombian
      samples tested in this study belonged to four clusters and they segregated mostly
      based on their geographic region. Most of the pfhrp2-deleted parasites were
      assigned to a single cluster and originated from Amazonas Department although a
      few pfhrp2-negative parasites originated from the other three clusters. The
      presence of a high proportion of pfhrp2-negative isolates in the Colombian Amazon
      may have implications for the use of PfHRP2-based RDTs in the region and may
      explain inconsistencies observed when PfHRP2-based tests and assays are
      performed.

TI  - Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance markers to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine among pregnant women receiving intermittent preventive 
      treatment for malaria in Uganda.
PG  - 5475-82
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00507-15 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of mutations in Plasmodium
      falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps)
      genes among pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as an
      intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp). A molecular epidemiological study of P.
      falciparum parasite resistance markers to SP was conducted from August 2010 to
      February 2012 in Mukono district in central Uganda. DNA was extracted from 413 P.
      falciparum-positive samples. Real-time PCR, followed by melting curve analysis,
      was used to characterize point mutations in the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes that are 
      associated with SP resistance. The prevalence of the single-nucleotide mutations 
      in Pfdhfr at codons 51I, 59R, and 108N and in Pfdhps at codons 437G and 540E was 
      high (>98%), reaching 100% fixation after one dose of SP, while the prevalence of
      581G was 3.3% at baseline, reaching 12.5% after one dose of SP. At baseline, the 
      prevalence of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps quintuple mutations was 89%, whereas the sextuple
      mutations (including 581G) were not prevalent (3.9%), reaching 16.7% after one
      dose of SP. However, the numbers of infections at follow-up visits were small,
      and hence there was insufficient statistical power to test whether there was a
      true rise in the prevalence of this allele. The overall high frequency of Pfdhfr 
      and Pfdhps quintuple mutations throughout pregnancy excluded further analyses of 
      possible associations between certain haplotypes and the risk of lower birth
      weight and anemia. However, women infected with P. falciparum had 1.3-g/dl-lower 
      hemoglobin levels (P = 0.001) and delivered babies with a 400-g-lower birth
      weight (P = 0.001) compared to nonparasitemic women. Despite this, 44 women who
      were P. falciparum positive at baseline became negative after one or two doses of
      SP (i.e., 50.5%), implying that SP-IPTp still has some efficacy. P. falciparum
      resistance markers to SP are high in this population, whereas P. falciparum
      infection was associated with poor birth outcomes.

TI  - Molecular determination of antifolate resistance associated point mutations in
      Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
      synthetase (dhps) genes among the field samples in Arunachal Pradesh.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antimalarial resistance in P. falciparum malaria
      parasite creates a serious obstacle in malaria control programme. Keeping this in
      mind, in the present study antifolate resistance associated point mutations in P.
      falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase
      (Pfdhps) genes among the field samples in Arunachal Pradesh were determined.
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 145 suspected malaria patients/healthy
      control subjects in malarious areas of Lohit and Changlang districts of Arunachal
      Pradesh, India during January 2012 to December 2013. RESULTS: In microscopic
      slide examination, 51.03% (74/145) were found malaria positive. Plasmodium
      falciparum mono-infection was observed in 62.16% (46/74) of total malaria
      positive cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed in all the P.
      falciparum positive samples for detection of 648 bp of Pfdhfr and 710 bp of
      Pfdhps genes. All the amplified products were analysed for detection of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms in dhfr and dhps genes. A total of four different
      genotypes of Pfdhfr gene were observed, of which double mutant allele ANRNI was
      mostly prevalent and it was found in 65.22% (30/46) cases. Likewise, four
      different haplotypes of Pfdhps gene were detected, of which triple mutant allele 
      AGEAA shares 69.57% (32/46) followed by other haplotypes. In Pfdhfr-Pfdhps two
      locus mutations analysis, two isolates in Changlang district had shown quintuple 
      mutant haplotype AIRNL-AGEAA, likely to be associated with treatment failure. The
      P. falciparum two locus dhfr-dhps haplotype (ANRNI-AGEAA) was observed in 56.52% 
      (26/46) cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Overall, high grade of
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance associated genetic polymorphisms were
      observed among the P. falciparum parasite population in Arunachal Pradesh during 
      the study period.

AB  - Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly is a rare and severe form of chronic
      malaria. This condition is a common cause of splenomegaly in endemic areas. The
      pathophysiology of hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly involves an intense
      immune reaction (predominantly B cell-driven) to repeated/chronic infections with
      Plasmodium sp. The diagnosis may be difficult, due to a poorly specific clinical 
      presentation (splenomegaly, fatigue, cytopenias), a long delay between residence 
      in a malaria-endemic area and onset of symptoms, and a frequent absence of
      parasites on conventional thin and thick blood smears. A strongly contributive
      laboratory parameter is the presence of high levels of total immunoglobulin M.
      When the diagnostic of hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly is considered, search
      for anti-Plasmodium antibodies and Plasmodium nucleic acids (genus and species)
      by PCR is useful. Diagnosis of hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly relies on the
      simultaneous presence of epidemiological, clinical, biological and follow-up
      findings. Regression of both splenomegaly and hypersplenism following
      antimalarial therapy allows the differential diagnosis with splenic lymphoma, a
      common complication of hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly. Although rare in
      Western countries, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly deserves increased
      medical awareness to reduce the incidence of incorrect diagnosis, to prevent
      progression to splenic lymphoma and to avoid splenectomy.

TI  - Distribution of Anopheles culicifacies and Detection of its Sibling Species E
      from Madhya Pradesh: Central India.
PG  - 186-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies is an important vector of malaria in Southeast
      Asia, contributing to almost 70% of malaria cases in India. It exists as a
      complex of five morphologically indistinguishable species A, B, C, D and E with
      varied geographical distribution patterns. In India, 8% of the total population
      of Madhya Pradesh (Central India) contributes about 30% of total malaria cases,
      60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths. An. culicifacies is the 
      major malaria vector in this state. Vector control mainly relies on the proper
      identification and distribution of vector species exists in a particular area.
      The present study was carried out to identify the distribution of An.
      culicifacies sibling species in certain endemic district of Central India, Madhya
      Pradesh. METHODS: The An. culicifacies mosquitoes collected from the study
      districts were identified morphologically. The genomic DNA was isolated from the 
      mosquitoes and subjected to Allele specific PCR targeting D3 domain of 28S
      ribosomal DNA. RESULTS: The mean prevalence of An. culicifacies during the study 
      period was in the range of 8-120 per man per hour (PMH). From the study areas
      species B was identified from Jabalpur, Chindwara and Hoshangabad, Species C from
      Hoshangabad only, Species D from Narsinghpur and Khandwa and sibling species E
      from Mandla, Chindwara and Hoshangabad respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the
      first report to detect species E from Madhya Pradesh region which necessitate for
      reconsideration of species distribution of each An. culicifacies sibling species 
      that would enable to develop required vector control strategies.

TI  - Monitoring artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum: comparison of
      parasite clearance time by microscopy and real-time PCR and evaluation of
      mutations in Pfatpase6 gene in Odisha state of India.
PG  - 3487-96
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4577-x [doi]
AB  - Antimalarial drug resistance including artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria is a major concern in combating malaria throughout the world. 
      Delayed parasite clearance time (PCT) is indicative of emergence of artemisinin
      resistance. Herein, PCT has been monitored with the help of gold standard
      technique microscopy accompanied by a more sensitive real-time assay for academic
      purpose. After the administration of artemisinin based combination therapy,
      artesunate + sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (AS + SP), all the subjects were followed 
      up to day 42 for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of AS + SP in Bisra
      Community Health Centre (CHC), Sundergarh district in the state of Odisha in
      India. Further, representative samples were analyzed for L263E, E431K, A623E and 
      S769N SNPs in Pfatpase6 gene and copy number polymorphisms in Pfmdr1 gene. Though
      all the samples were found parasite negative according to microscopy by the end
      of day 3 and attained adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at
      the end of day 42, real-time PCR showed day 3 positivity in 12 of the total
      analyzed samples (n = 43). This was further validated by end-point diagnostic PCR
      and correlated with high initial parasite load. E431K mutation was observed in 2 
      of the 12 samples (16.7 %) while the controls (n = 18) were all wild. L263E,
      A623E and S769N were wild in all the analyzed samples (n = 30). Pfmdr1 copy
      number analysis showed no change in the said trait. Conclusively, real-time PCR
      could support microscopy for better monitoring of PCT and may provide as an
      additional but useful research tool for artemisinin resistance studies.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Enfranze, north-west Ethiopia.
PG  - 258
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0775-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum accounts for approximately 60% of malaria cases
      in Ethiopia and artemether-lumefantrine has been used as a first-line treatment
      for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria since 2004. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment
      of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in north-western Ethiopia. METHODS: A
      28-day one-arm, prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological
      response to the first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria was 
      conducted in Enfranze Health Centre in accordance with the 2009 WHO efficacy
      study guidelines. Patients were treated with a 3-day course of AL and clinical
      and parasitological parameters were monitored over a 28-day follow-up. All data
      from recruited patients were imported into an electronic data base and
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for analysing primary [early treatment
      failures (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF), late parasitological failures (LPF),
      and adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR)] and secondary (PCT,
      GCT and FCT) outcomes. RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled and all of them
      completed the 28-day follow-up period. The PCR-corrected cure rate was 95.0% (95%
      CI 87.0-98.4%) and there were two ETF, one LCF and three LPF. Two of the LPF were
      classified as re infections by PCR. Seventy three point seven five percent, 91.25
      and 95% of patients had cleared their parasitaemia by days 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively, and 75, 91.25 and 96.25% of patients had cleared their fever by
      days 1, 2, and 3. All patients completely cleared their gametocytes by day 7.
      CONCLUSION: The relatively high cure rate, low proportion of patients still
      positive on day 3 as well as parasite clearance times in this study would
      indicate no imminent threat of artemisinin resistance development in the region. 
      However, the threat of spreading or de novo development of artemisinin resistance
      warrants regular monitoring of drug efficacy throughout the region.

      falciparum Infection.
PG  - e0129825
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129825 [doi]
AB  - Immunodeficient mouse-human chimeras provide a powerful approach to study host
      specific pathogens like Plasmodium (P.) falciparum that causes human malaria.
      Existing mouse models of P. falciparum infection require repeated injections of
      human red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, clodronate lipsomes and
      anti-neutrophil antibodies are injected to suppress the clearance of human RBCs
      by the residual immune system of the immunodeficient mice. Engraftment of
      NOD-scid Il2rg-/- mice with human hematopoietic stem cells leads to
      reconstitution of human immune cells. Although human B cell reconstitution is
      robust and T cell reconstitution is reasonable in the recipient mice, human RBC
      reconstitution is generally poor or undetectable. The poor reconstitution is
      mainly the result of a deficiency of appropriate human cytokines that are
      necessary for the development and maintenance of these cell lineages. Delivery of
      plasmid DNA encoding human erythropoietin and interleukin-3 into humanized mice
      by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection resulted in significantly enhanced
      reconstitution of erythrocytes. With this improved humanized mouse, here we show 
      that P. falciparum infects de novo generated human RBCs, develops into schizonts 
      and causes successive reinvasion. We also show that different parasite strains
      exhibit variation in their ability to infect these humanized mice. Parasites
      could be detected by nested PCR in the blood samples of humanized mice infected
      with P. falciparum K1 and HB3 strains for 3 cycles, whereas in other strains such
      as 3D7, DD2, 7G8, FCR3 and W2mef parasites could only be detected for 1 cycle. In
      vivo adaptation of K1 strain further improves the infection efficiency and
      parasites can be detected by microscopy for 3 cycles. The parasitemia ranges
      between 0.13 and 0.25% at the first cycle of infection, falls between 0.08 and
      0.15% at the second cycle, and drops to barely detectable levels at the third
      cycle of infection. Compared to existing mouse models, our model generates human 
      RBCs de novo and does not require the treatment of mice with immunomodulators.

TI  - [Monkey malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi infection) after travelling to Thailand].
PG  - 815-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-101378 [doi]
AB  - A case of malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is described in a 52-year-old
      female German traveler after returning from Thailand. P. knowlesi is a parasite
      of macaques in Southeast Asia and has been recognized in recent years as an
      important and probably increasing cause of human malaria in some areas. At least 
      16 cases in international travelers have been published so far. This includes
      four cases imported to Germany. All German patients visited forested areas in
      Southern Thailand inhabited by the natural monkey host prior to their illness.
      Most cases diagnosed in endemic areas present as mild disease. However in some
      patients P. knowlesi may take a severe and life-threatening course. Diagnosis is 
      usually is based on microscopy whereas rapid tests are not reliable. However,
      microscopic differentiation of P. knowlesi from other plasmodium species (eg, P. 
      malariae, P. falciparum) is difficult, especially when parasitemia is low. Thus
      PCR methods are required for definite species determination. Changing endemicity 
      as well as changing tourism patterns such as the trend towards eco-tourism might 
      increase the risk of infection for travelers even in areas which are considered
      as low endemic for malaria. Malaria has to be considered in all febrile patients 
      returning from endemic areas. In Southeast Asia this has to include Plasmodium
      knowlesi infection. Especially if microscopy suggests P. falciparum/P. malariae
      double infection, or when results indicate P. malariae but the clinical
      presentation differs from that of quartan malaria (eg, daily fever), diagnostic
      procedures for P. knowlesi should be initiated. Currently available rapid
      diagnostic tests are not reliable for the detection of P. knowlesi. The definite 
      diagnosis of P. knowlesi infection usually requires PCR techniques Changing
      tourism patterns such as the trend towards eco-tourism might increase the risk of
      infection for travelers even in low prevalence areas.

AB  - We screened 52 children adopted from Ethiopia for malaria because they had
      previously lived in a disease-endemic region or had past or current hepatomegaly 
      or splenomegaly. Seven (13.5%) children had asymptomatic malaria parasitemia by
      microscopy (n = 2) or PCR (n = 5). Our findings suggest that adoptees at risk for
      asymptomatic malaria should be screened, preferably by PCR.

TI  - Population genetic study of Plasmodium falciparum parasites pertaining to dhps
      gene sequence in malaria endemic areas of Assam.
PG  - 401-5
LID - 10.4103/0255-0857.158565 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite had developed resistance to almost all the
      currently used antimalarial drugs. The purpose of the study was to come across
      the genetic distances in P. falciparum dhps gene sequences circulating in Assam. 
      A partial fragment of P. falciparum dhps gene containing major single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms associated with sulphadoxine resistance were amplified and
      sequenced. Thereafter specific bioinformatics tools like BioEdit v7.0.9, ClustalW
      in Mega 5, DnaSP version v.5.10.01 etc were used for the analysis. A total of 100
      P. falciparum positive cases in different malaria endemic areas of Assam were
      included for the study. Based upon the mutation analysis, a total of seven
      different P. falciparum dhps genotypes were observed with five variable sites.
      Maximum five haplotypes were found in the P. falciparum isolates from Jorhat
      district of Assam. Four polymorphic sites were observed in the P. falciparum dhps
      gene sequences in Karbi Anglong, NC Hills, Chirang and Jorhat whereas the
      isolates from other study areas had three polymorphic sites. A statistically
      significant positive value of Tajima's D were observed among the P. falciparum
      field isolates in Assam indicating that there is an excess of intermediate
      frequency alleles and can result from population bottlenecks, structure and/or
      balancing selection. Extensive gene flow took place among the P. falciparum
      population of Jorhat with Sivasagar, Chirang with Sivasagar and Chirang with
      Karbi Anglong. However, large genetic differentiation was observed among the P.
      falciparum isolates of NC Hills with Lakhimpur, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Golaghat 
      and also the parasite population of Karbi Anglong with Lakhimpur and Tinsukia
      signifying little gene flow among the population. This finding has shown that
      mutant Pfdhps gene associated with sulphadoxine resistance is circulating in
      Assam. It is believed that, the parasite population may have undergone high level
      of breeding.

TI  - A multi-center, open-label trial to compare the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
      Artemether-Lumefantrine in children with severe acute malnutrition versus
      children without severe acute malnutrition: study protocol for the MAL-NUT study.
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-0963-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and malaria frequently coexist in sub-Saharan African
      countries. Studies on efficacy of antimalarial treatments usually follow the WHO 
      standardized protocol in which severely malnourished children are systematically 
      excluded. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of chloroquine,
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and quinine in severe acute malnourished children.
      Overall, efficacy of these treatments appeared to be reduced, attributed to lower
      immunity and for some antimalarials altered pharmacokinetic profiles and lower
      drug concentrations. However, similar research on the efficacy and
      pharmacokinetic profiles of artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) and
      especially artemether-lumefantrine in malnourished children is currently lacking.
      The main objective of this study is to assess whether artemether-lumefantrine is 
      less efficacious in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM)
      compared to non-SAM children, and if so, to what extent this can be attributed to
      a sub-optimal pharmacokinetic profile. METHODS/DESIGN: In two sites,
      Ouelessebougou, Mali and Maradi, Niger, children with uncomplicated
      microscopically-confirmed P. falciparum malaria aged between 6 and 59 months will
      be enrolled. Two non-SAM children will be enrolled after the enrolment of each
      SAM case. Children with severe manifestations of malaria or complications of
      acute malnutrition needing intensive treatment will be excluded. Treatment
      intakes will be supervised and children will be followed-up for 42 days,
      according to WHO guidance for surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy.
      Polymerase Chain Reaction genotyping will be used to distinguish recrudescence
      from re-infection. SAM children will also benefit from the national nutritional
      rehabilitation program. Outcomes will be compared between the SAM and non-SAM
      populations. The primary outcome will be adequate clinical and parasitological
      response at day 28 after PCR correction, estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. To
      assess the pharmacokinetic profile of lumefantrine, a sparse sampling approach
      will be used with randomized allocation of sampling times (5 per child). A total 
      of 180 SAM children and 360 non-SAM children will be recruited during the 2013
      and 2014 malaria seasons. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important
      information that is currently lacking on the effect of SAM on therapeutic
      efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of artemether-lumefantrine. If it shows
      lower therapeutic efficacy and decreased lumefantrine concentrations, it would
      inform dose optimization studies in SAM children. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - In the erythrocytes, malaria parasite entry and infection is mediated through
      complex membrane sorting and signaling processes. We investigated the effects of 
      single-locus and multilocus interactions to test the hypothesis that the members 
      of the GPCR family genes, adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and G-protein coupled 
      receptor kinase5 (GRK5), may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria caused by 
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) independently or through complex interactions. In a
      case-control study of adults, individuals affected by Pf malaria (complicated
      n=168; uncomplicated n=282) and healthy controls (n=450) were tested for their
      association to four known SNPs in GRK5 (rs2230345, rs2275036, rs4752307 and
      rs11198918) and two in ADORA2A (rs9624472 and rs5751876) genes with malaria
      susceptibility, using techniques of polymerase chain reaction-restriction
      fragment length polymorphisms and direct DNA sequencing. Single-locus analysis
      showed significant association of 2 SNPs; rs5751876 (OR=3.2(2.0-5.2); p=0.0006)
      of ADORA2A and rs2230345 (OR=0.3(0.2-0.5); p=0.0006) of GRK5 with malaria. The
      mean of the serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with
      variant GG (p=0.006) of rs9624472 in ADORA2A gene compared to AA and AG genotypes
      in complicated Pf malaria cases, with the G allele also showing increased risk
      for malaria (OR=1.3(1.1-1.6); p=0.017). Analyses of predicted haplotypes of the
      two ADORA2A and the four GRK5 SNPs have identified the haplotypes that conferred 
      risk as well as resistance to malaria with statistical significance. Molecular
      docking analysis of evolutionary rs2230345 SNP indicated a stable activity of
      GRK5 for the mutant allele compared to the wild type. Further, generalized
      multifactor dimensionality reduction to test the contribution of individual
      effects of the six polymorphisms and higher-order interactions to risk of
      symptoms/clinical complications of malaria suggested a best six-locus model
      showing statistical significance. The study provides evidence for the role of
      ADORA2A and GRK5 that might influence the etiology of malaria infection.

AB  - We describe a simple method for detection of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium
      falciparum infection in anophelines using a triplex TaqMan real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) assay (18S rRNA). We tested the assay on Anopheles darlingi 
      and Anopheles stephensi colony mosquitoes fed with Plasmodium-infected blood
      meals and in duplicate on field collected An. darlingi. We compared the real-time
      PCR results of colony-infected and field collected An. darlingi, separately, to a
      conventional PCR method. We determined that a cytochrome b-PCR method was only
      3.33% as sensitive and 93.38% as specific as our real-time PCR assay with
      field-collected samples. We demonstrate that this assay is sensitive, specific
      and reproducible.

TI  - TpUB05, a Homologue of the Immunodominant Plasmodium falciparum Protein UB05, Is 
      a Marker of Protective Immune Responses in Cattle Experimentally Vaccinated
      against East Coast Fever.
PG  - e0128040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0128040 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: East Coast fever, a devastating disease of cattle, can be
      controlled partially by vaccination with live T. parva sporozoites. The antigens 
      responsible for conferring immunity are not fully characterized. Recently it was 
      shown that the P. falciparum immunodominant protein UB05 is highly conserved in
      T. parva, the causative agent of East Coast fever. The aim of the present
      investigation was to determine the role of the homologue TpUB05 in protective
      immunity to East Coast fever. METHODS: The cloning, sequencing and expression of 
      TpUB05 were done according to standard protocols. Bioinformatics analysis of
      TpUB05 gene was carried out using algorithms found in the public domain.
      Polyclonal antiserum against recombinant TpUB05 were raised in rabbits and used
      for further analysis by Western blotting, ELISA, immunolocalization and in vitro 
      infection neutralization assay. The ability of recombinant TpUB05 (r-TpUB05) to
      stimulate bovine PBMCs ex-vivo to produce IFN-gamma or to proliferate was tested 
      using ELISpot and [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays, respectively. RESULTS: All
      the 20 cattle immunised by the infection and treatment method (ITM) developed
      significantly higher levels of TpUB05 specific antibodies (p<0.0001) compared to 
      the non-vaccinated ones. Similarly, r-TpUB05 highly stimulated bovine PMBCs from 
      8/12 (67%) of ITM-immunized cattle tested to produce IFN-gamma and proliferate
      (p< 0.029) as compared to the 04 nasmall yi, Ukrainianve cattle included as
      controls. Polyclonal TpUB05 antiserum raised against r-TpUB05 also marginally
      inhibited infection (p < 0.046) of bovine PBMCs by T. parva sporozoites. In
      further experiments RT-PCR showed that the TpUB05 gene is expressed by the
      parasite. This was confirmed by immunolocalization studies which revealed TpUB05 
      expression by schizonts and piroplasms. Bioinformatics analysis also revealed
      that this antigen possesses two transmembrane domains, a N-glycosylation site and
      several O-glycosylation sites. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that TpUB05 is a
      potential marker of protective immunity in ECF worth investigating further.

TI  - Presence of Plasmodium falciparum DNA in Plasma Does Not Predict Clinical Malaria
      in an HIV-1 Infected Population.
PG  - e0129519
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-1 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria cause substantial morbidity
      in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as co-infecting pathogens. We examined the
      relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical
      malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on
      P. falciparum PCR positivity. METHODS: ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based 
      regimens and one PI-based anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy
      naive participants. We performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P.
      falciparum 18s rRNA gene to detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 
      participants enrolled in Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the
      closest sample preceding the first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with
      clinical malaria and randomly selected follow up samples from 88 persons without 
      clinical malaria. RESULTS: PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline
      samples and was not significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell
      count, baseline HIV-1 RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks.
      Neither baseline PCR positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of
      antiretroviral therapy (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent
      clinical malaria. Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not
      significantly associated with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria
      (p = 0.609). Clinical malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 
      0.006) and a lower BMI (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: P. falciparum DNA was detected in
      8% of participants at baseline, but was not significantly associated with
      subsequent development of clinical malaria. HIV PI therapy did not decrease the
      prevalence of PCR positivity or incidence of clinical disease.

TI  - Intervals to Plasmodium falciparum recurrence after anti-malarial treatment in
      pregnancy: a longitudinal prospective cohort.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0745-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infections adversely affect pregnancy.
      Anti-malarial treatment failure is common. The objective of this study was to
      examine the duration of persistent parasite carriage following anti-malarial
      treatment in pregnancy. METHODS: The data presented here are a collation from
      previous studies carried out since 1994 in the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit
      (SMRU) on the Thailand-Myanmar border and performed using the same unique
      methodology detailed in the Materials and Methods section. Screening for malaria 
      by microscopy is a routine part of weekly antenatal care (ANC) visits and
      therapeutic responses to anti-malarials were assessed in P. falciparum malaria
      cases. Women with microscopy confirmed P. falciparum malaria had a PCR blood spot
      from a finger-prick sample collected. Parasite DNA was extracted from the
      blood-spot samples using saponin lysis/Chelex extraction method and genotyped
      using polymorphic segments of MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP. Recurrent infections were
      classified by genotyping as novel, recrudescent or indeterminate. Factors
      associated with time to microscopy-detected recrudescence were analysed using
      multivariable regression techniques. RESULTS: From December 1994 to November
      2009, 700 women were treated for P. falciparum and there were 909 recurrent
      episodes (481 novel and 428 recrudescent) confirmed by PCR genotyping. Most of
      the recurrences, 85% (770/909), occurred after treatment with quinine
      monotherapy, artesunate monotherapy or artesunate-clindamycin. The geometric mean
      number of days to recurrence was significantly shorter in women with recrudescent
      infection, 24.5 (95%: 23.4-25.8), compared to re-infection, 49.7 (95%:
      46.9-52.7), P<0.001. The proportion of recrudescent P. falciparum infections that
      occurred after days 28, 42 and 63 from the start of treatment was 29.1%
      (124/428), 13.3% (57/428) and 5.6% (24/428). Recrudescent infections>/=100 days
      after treatment occurred with quinine and mefloquine monotherapy, and
      quinine+clindamycin and artesunate+atovaquone-proguanil combination therapy.
      Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative or an intercalated Plasmodium
      vivax infection increased the geometric mean interval to recrudescence by
      1.28-fold (95% CI: 1.09-1.51) and 2.19-fold (1.77-2.72), respectively. Intervals 
      to recrudescence were decreased 0.83-fold (0.73-0.95) if treatment was not fully 
      supervised (suggesting incomplete adherence) and 0.98-fold (0.96-0.99) for each
      doubling in baseline parasitaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged time to recrudescence
      may occur in pregnancy, regardless of anti-malarial treatment. Long intervals to 
      recrudescence are more likely with the use of artemisinin-containing treatments
      and also observed with intercalated P. vivax infections treated with chloroquine.
      Accurate determination of drug efficacy in pregnancy requires longer duration of 
      follow-up, preferably until delivery or day 63, whichever occurs last.

TI  - Tailoring a Pediatric Formulation of Artemether-Lumefantrine for Treatment of
      Plasmodium falciparum Malaria.
PG  - 4366-74
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00014-15 [doi]
AB  - Specially created pediatric formulations have the potential to improve the
      acceptability, effectiveness, and accuracy of dosing of artemisinin-based
      combination therapy (ACT) in young children, a patient group that is inherently
      vulnerable to malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) Dispersible is a pediatric
      formulation of AL that is specifically tailored for the treatment of children
      with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, offering benefits relating to
      efficacy, convenience and acceptance, accuracy of dosing, safety, sterility,
      stability, and a pharmacokinetic profile and bioequivalence similar to those of
      crushed and intact AL tablets. However, despite being the first pediatric
      antimalarial to meet World Health Organization (WHO) specifications for use in
      infants and children who are >/=5 kg in body weight and its inclusion in WHO
      Guidelines, there are few publications that focus on AL Dispersible. Based on a
      systematic review of the recent literature, this paper provides a comprehensive
      overview of the clinical experience with AL Dispersible to date. A randomized,
      phase 3 study that compared the efficacy and safety of AL Dispersible to those of
      crushed AL tablets in 899 African children reported high PCR-corrected cure rates
      at day 28 (97.8% and 98.5% for AL Dispersible and crushed tablets, respectively),
      and the results of several subanalyses of these data indicate that this activity 
      is observed regardless of patient weight, food intake, and maximum plasma
      concentrations of artemether or its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin. These 
      and other clinical data support the continued use of pediatric antimalarial
      formulations in all children <5 years of age with uncomplicated malaria when
      accompanied by continued monitoring for the emergence of resistance.

TI  - Genetic diversity in the msp-1 and msp-2 alleles among Plasmodium falciparum
      field isolates from Jazan, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum infections in human is associated 
      with the pathogenesis of malaria. It is commonly determined through amplification
      of the polymorphic regions of the merozoite surface proteins -1 (msp-1) and -2
      (msp-2) genes. This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence of the msp-1 and 
      msp-2 allelic familiesand (2) identify the multiplicity of infection (MOI) in P. 
      falciparum field isolates from the Jazan region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
      (KSA). Blood samples from patients with microscopically confirmed malaria
      infections (N = 48), collected in 2010, were analysed for msp-1 and msp-2
      polymorphisms.K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic types of the msp-1 gene and 3D7 and FC27
      alleles of the msp-2 gene were analysed via nested polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) according to band size. The MOI was then calculated. In msp-1, 16 different
      alleles were identified by examining size differences in the agarose gels. These 
      alleles-representing 5, 5 & 6 alleles-belong to K1 (120bp-420bp), RO22
      (180bp-420bp) and MAD 20 (150 bp-410bp), respectively. For msp-2, a larger range 
      of amplicon sizes was detected. A total of 13 different alleles were identified: 
      the FC27 family had 6 alleles (380- bp1280bp), while the 3D7 family had 7 alleles
      (110 bp-1200bp.MOI was 1.81 for MSP-1 & 2.17 for MSP-2, with overall mean MOI of 
      1.99). Considerable genetic diversity was evident in the P. falciparum field
      isolates from the Jazan region of KSA. This diversity represents an essential
      step in developing effective measures to prevent malaria in KSA, as well as in
      assessing vaccines derived from these genes.

TI  - Survey of chloroquine-resistant mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum pfcrt and 
      pfmdr-1 genes in Hadhramout, Yemen.
PG  - 59-63

LID - S0001-706X(15)30006-1 [pii]
AB  - Malaria is still a major public health problem in Yemen. More than 95% of the
      malaria cases are due to Plasmodium falciparum. Recently in Yemen, the
      antimalarial treatment policy was changed from chloroquine (CQ) to artemisinin
      combination therapy (ACTs). However, CQ is still available and prescribed in the 
      Yemeni market. The persistence of CQ resistance will be prolonged if the shift to
      ACT and the simultaneous withdrawal of CQ are not rigorously implemented. The aim
      of the current survey is to detect chloroquine-resistant mutations in P.
      falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum
      multi-drug resistance-1 (pfmdr1) genes. These data will be important for future
      monitoring and assessment of antimalarial drug policy in Yemen. Blood specimens
      were collected from 735 individuals from different districts of the Hadhramout
      province, Yemen by house-to-house visit. Mutation-specific nested polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
      methods were used to investigate the mutations in the pfmdr1(codons 86 and 1246) 
      and pfcrt (codons 76, 271, 326, 356 and 371) genes. The overall prevalence of
      pfcrt mutations at codons 76, 271, 326 and 371 were 50.4%, 58.7%, 54.3% and
      44.9%, respectively. All isolates had wild-type pfcrt 356 allele. The majority of
      pfmdr1 86 alleles (83.3%) and all pfmdr1 1246 alleles were wild type. There was
      no association between pfcrt mutations and symptomatology, gender and age groups.
      In conclusion, point mutations in codons 76, 271, 326 and 371 of pfcrt of P.
      falciparum are high suggesting a sustained high CQ resistance even after 4 years 
      of shifting to ACTs. These findings warrant complete withdrawal of CQ use from
      the Yemeni market for P. falciparum and careful usage of CQ for treating
      Plasmodium vivax.

TI  - bla CTX-M-I group extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing Salmonella typhi
      from hospitalized patients in Lagos, Nigeria.
PG  - 99-106
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S78876 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The global spread of bla CTX-M-I extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
      (ESBL)-producing Salmonella spp. remains a major threat to treatment and control.
      Evidence of emergence and spread of this marker are lacking in Nigeria. This
      study investigated bla CTX-M-I ESBL production among Salmonella isolates from
      hospitalized patients. METHODS: Patients (158 total) made up of two groups were
      evaluated. Group A was composed of 135 patients with persistent pyrexia and group
      B was composed of 23 gastroenteritis patients and their stool samples. Samples
      were cultured, and isolates were identified and were subjected to antibiotic
      susceptibility testing by standard methods. Isolates were further screened for
      ESBL production, bla CTX-M-I genes and transferability by double disk synergy
      test, plasmid extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and conjugation experiment. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-five (25.9%) Salmonella isolates were identified from group A, of
      which 74.3% were S. typhi, 22.9% were S. paratyphi and two (5.7%) were invasive
      non-typhoidal S. enteritidis. Nine Plasmodium falciparum infections were
      recorded, four of which were identified as co-infections with typhoidal
      Salmonella. Only two (8.7%) S. enteritidis samples were obtained from group B
      (P>0.05). A total of 24 isolates were ESBL-positive, eliciting resistance to five
      to seven antibiotics, and were multiple-drug resistant. ESBL production due to
      the bla CTX-M-I gene cluster was detected in eleven (45.8%) Salmonella isolates. 
      Nine (81.8%) of the eleven bla CTX-M-I ESBL producers were S. typhi and two
      (18.2%) isolates were S. enteritidis. Four of nine S. typhi bla CTX-M-I
      ESBL-producing strains harbored 23 kb self-transmissible plasmid that was
      co-transferred with cefotaxime and augmentin resistance to Escherichia coli j53-2
      transconjugants. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the emergence of bla CTX-M-I S. 
      typhi as an agent of persistent pyrexia with potential to spread to other
      Enterobacteriaceae in Lagos, Nigeria. Cautionary prescription and judicious use
      of third-generation cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime, for the treatment of
      typhoid fever and routine screening for P. falciparum co-infection with
      ESBL-producing Salmonella in the laboratories during diagnosis of persistent
      pyrexia conditions in patients are recommended.

TI  - Blood-Stage Parasitaemia and Age Determine Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax
      Gametocytaemia in Papua New Guinea.
PG  - e0126747
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126747 [doi]
AB  - A better understanding of human-to-mosquito transmission is crucial to control
      malaria. In order to assess factors associated with gametocyte carriage, 2083
      samples were collected in a cross-sectional survey in Papua New Guinea.
      Plasmodium species were detected by light microscopy and qPCR and gametocytes by 
      detection of pfs25 and pvs25 mRNA transcripts by reverse-transcriptase PCR
      (qRT-PCR). The parasite prevalence by PCR was 18.5% for Plasmodium falciparum and
      13.0% for P. vivax. 52.5% of all infections were submicroscopic. Gametocytes were
      detected in 60% of P. falciparum-positive and 51% of P. vivax-positive samples.
      Each 10-fold increase in parasite density led to a 1.8-fold and 3.3-fold increase
      in the odds of carrying P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocytes. Thus the
      proportion of gametocyte positive and gametocyte densities was highest in young
      children carrying high asexual parasite densities and in symptomatic individuals.
      Dilution series of gametocytes allowed absolute quantification of gametocyte
      densities by qRT-PCR and showed that pvs25 expression is 10-20 fold lower than
      pfs25 expression. Between 2006 and 2010 parasite prevalence in the study site has
      decreased by half. 90% of the remaining infections were asymptomatic and likely
      constitute an important reservoir of transmission. However, mean gametocyte
      densities were low (approx. 1-2 gametocyte/muL) and it remains to be determined
      to what extent low-density gametocyte positive individuals are infective to
      mosquitos.

TI  - High Rates of Asymptomatic, Sub-microscopic Plasmodium vivax Infection and
      Disappearing Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in an Area of Low Transmission in
      Solomon Islands.
PG  - e0003758
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003758 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Solomon Islands is intensifying national efforts to achieve malaria
      elimination. A long history of indoor spraying with residual insecticides,
      combined recently with distribution of long lasting insecticidal nets and
      artemether-lumefantrine therapy, has been implemented in Solomon Islands. The
      impact of these interventions on local endemicity of Plasmodium spp. is unknown. 
      METHODS: In 2012, a cross-sectional survey of 3501 residents of all ages was
      conducted in Ngella, Central Islands Province, Solomon Islands. Prevalence of
      Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae was assessed by
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) and light microscopy (LM). Presence of gametocytes was
      determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: By qPCR,
      468 Plasmodium spp. infections were detected (prevalence = 13.4%; 463 P. vivax,
      five mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax, no P. ovale or P. malariae) versus 130 by LM
      (prevalence = 3.7%; 126 P. vivax, three P. falciparum and one P. falciparum/P.
      vivax). The prevalence of P. vivax infection varied significantly among villages 
      (range 3.0-38.5%, p<0.001) and across age groups (5.3-25.9%, p<0.001). Of 468 P. 
      vivax infections, 72.9% were sub-microscopic, 84.5% afebrile and 60.0% were both 
      sub-microscopic and afebrile. Local residency, low education level of the
      household head and living in a household with at least one other P. vivax
      infected individual increased the risk of P. vivax infection. Overall, 23.5% of
      P. vivax infections had concurrent gametocytaemia. Of all P. vivax positive
      samples, 29.2% were polyclonal by MS16 and msp1F3 genotyping. All five P.
      falciparum infections were detected in residents of the same village, carried the
      same msp2 allele and four were positive for P. falciparum gametocytes.
      CONCLUSION: P. vivax infection remains endemic in Ngella, with the majority of
      cases afebrile and below the detection limit of LM. P. falciparum has nearly
      disappeared, but the risk of re-introductions and outbreaks due to travel to
      nearby islands with higher malaria endemicity remains.

TI  - Molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance in southwest Ethiopia over
      time: regional surveillance from 2006 to 2013.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0723-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is one of the main reasons of anti-malarial treatment
      failures and impedes malaria containment strategies. As single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to correlate with anti-malarial drug
      resistance, the surveillance strategy includes continuous monitoring of known
      molecular markers and detection of new mutation patterns. With the introduction
      of artemisinin-based combination therapy, selection of specific patterns has been
      observed worldwide. METHODS: From March to June 2013, whole blood was collected
      on filter paper from microscopically malaria positive patients in Jimma zone
      (District), southwestern Ethiopia. Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and
      mixed infections were included. SNPs were investigated by conventional or
      real-time PCR, restriction fragment length pattern analysis or sequencing.
      Results were compared to molecular patterns from Ethiopian isolates in 2004, 2006
      and 2008/9. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed infections were
      molecularly confirmed in 177, 80, and 14 samples, respectively. In P. falciparum,
      mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr 1and pfATP 6 (SERCA) gene were investigated.
      Whereas the mutation in the pfcrt gene at codon 76 K was still found in 95.6% of 
      all samples, the pfmdr 1 86 T mutation fell to 1.2% (2/163) in 2013 compared to
      9% in 2008/9 and 86% in 2006 (P<0.001). The pfmdr 1 184 F mutation dominated with
      100.0% (172/172) in 2013. Sequencing of the recently reported PF3D7_1343700 kelch
      propeller domain showed no mutation at codon 476. First sequencing data of the
      pvmdr 1 gene from Jimma region revealed a prevalence of the mutations 976 F and
      1076 L in 72.7% (16/23) and 100.0% (19/19) of the isolates, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Since the introduction of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in Jimma,
      Ethiopia, in 2006, the prevalence of certain SNPs associated with AL use has
      increased. Markers for chloroquine resistance in P. vivax were highly frequent.
      Continuous molecular and clinical surveillance are of paramount importance.

AB  - Malaria is the leading identifiable cause of fever in returning travelers.
      Accurate Plasmodium species identification has therapy implications for P. vivax 
      and P. ovale, which have dormant liver stages requiring primaquine. Compared to
      microscopy, nucleic acid tests have improved specificity for species
      identification and higher sensitivity for mixed infections. Here, we describe a
      SYBR green-based real-time PCR assay for Plasmodium species identification from
      whole blood, which uses a panel of reactions to detect species-specific non-18S
      rRNA gene targets. A pan-Plasmodium 18S rRNA target is also amplified to allow
      species identification or confirmation by sequencing if necessary. An evaluation 
      of assay accuracy, performed on 76 clinical samples (56 positives using thin
      smear microscopy as the reference method and 20 negatives), demonstrated clinical
      sensitivities of 95.2% for P. falciparum (20/21 positives detected) and 100% for 
      the Plasmodium genus (52/52), P. vivax (20/20), P. ovale (9/9), and P. malariae
      (6/6). The sensitivity of the P. knowlesi-specific PCR was evaluated using spiked
      whole blood samples (100% [10/10 detected]). The specificities of the real-time
      PCR primers were 94.2% for P. vivax (49/52) and 100% for P. falciparum (51/51),
      P. ovale (62/62), P. malariae (69/69), and P. knowlesi (52/52). Thirty-three
      specimens were used to test species identification by sequencing the
      pan-Plasmodium 18S rRNA PCR product, with correct identification in all cases.
      The real-time PCR assay also identified two samples with mixed P. falciparum and 
      P. ovale infection, which was confirmed by sequencing. The assay described here
      can be integrated into a malaria testing algorithm in low-prevalence areas,
      allowing definitive Plasmodium species identification shortly after malaria
      diagnosis by microscopy.

TI  - High prevalence of sub-microscopic infections in Colombia.
PG  - 201
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0711-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission in Latin America is typically characterized as
      hypo-endemic and unstable with ~170 million inhabitants at risk of malaria
      infection. Although Colombia has witnessed an important decrease in malaria
      transmission, the disease remains a public health problem with an estimated ~10
      million people currently living in areas with malaria risk and ~61,000 cases
      reported in 2012. This study aimed to establish the malaria prevalence in three
      endemic regions of Colombia to aid in designing new interventions for malaria
      elimination. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three regions of 
      Colombia with different malaria epidemiological profiles: Tierralta (Ta), Tumaco 
      (Tu) and Buenaventura (Bv). The Annual Parasite Index (API) was 10.7, 6.9 and
      3.1, respectively. Participants were asked to respond to a sociodemographic
      questionnaire and then were bled to determine the Duffy genotype and the
      prevalence of malaria infection by microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR
      (qPCR). RESULTS: The study was conducted between October 2011 and January 2012.
      Eight sentinel sites with 1,169 subjects from 267 households were included. The
      overall prevalence of sub-microscopic infections measured by thick blood smear
      (TBS) was 0.3% (n=4) whereas by qPCR it was 9.7% (n=113), with a greater
      proportion (13%) in 40-50 years old individuals. Furthermore, different regions
      displayed different prevalence of sub-microscopic infections: Bv 12%, Ta 15%, and
      Tu 4%. From these 113 samples (qPCR), 74% were positive for P. vivax and 22% for 
      P. falciparum, and 4% were mixed infections, which correlates to the overall
      parasite prevalence in Colombia. This study showed that in the southern Pacific
      coast of Colombia (Bv and Tu), around 56% of the population have a Duffy-negative
      genotype, compared to the northern region (Ta) where the percentage of
      Duffy-negative genotype is around 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-microscopic infections are
      prevalent across different regions in Colombia, particularly in areas with
      relatively low transmission intensity. The poor microscopy results suggest the
      need for more sensitive diagnostic tools for detection of sub-microscopic
      infections. This study underscores the importance of conducting active case
      surveillance to more accurately determine malaria incidence, and highlights the
      need for updating the malaria guidelines to track and treat sub-microscopic
      malaria infections.

TI  - Capture and Ligation Probe-PCR (CLIP-PCR) for Molecular Screening, with
      Application to Active Malaria Surveillance for Elimination.
PG  - 821-8
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2014.237115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria control programs have achieved remarkable success during the 
      past decade. Nonetheless, sensitive and affordable methods for active screening
      of malaria parasites in low-transmission settings remain urgently needed.
      METHODS: We developed a molecular screening method, capture and ligation
      probe-PCR (CLIP-PCR), which achieved the sensitivity of reverse-transcription PCR
      but eliminated the reliance on RNA purification and reverse transcription. In
      this method, 18S rRNA of genus Plasmodium is released from blood, captured onto
      96-well plates, and quantified by the amount of ligated probes that bind
      continuously to it. We first used laboratory-prepared samples to test the method 
      across a range of parasite densities and pool sizes, then applied the method to
      an active screening of 3358 dried blood spot samples collected from 3 low-endemic
      areas in China. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum diluted in whole blood lysate
      could be detected at a concentration as low as 0.01 parasites/muL, and a pool
      size of </=36 did not significantly affect assay performance. When coupled with a
      matrix pooling strategy, the assay drastically increased throughput to thousands 
      of samples per run while reducing the assay cost to cents per sample. In the
      active screening, CLIP-PCR identified 14 infections, including 4 asymptomatic
      ones, with <500 tests, costing <US$0.60 for each sample. All positive results
      were confirmed by standard quantitative PCR. CONCLUSIONS: CLIP-PCR, by use of
      dried blood spots with a pooling strategy, efficiently offers a highly sensitive 
      and high-throughput approach to detect asymptomatic submicroscopic infections
      with reduced cost and labor, making it an ideal tool for large-scale malaria
      surveillance in elimination settings.

TI  - Detection of mixed-species infections of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax by nested PCR and rapid diagnostic tests in southeastern Iran.
PG  - 181-5
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0650 [doi]
AB  - Coexistence of two species of Plasmodium in a single host has disrupted the
      diagnosis and treatment of malaria. This study was designed to evaluate the
      ability of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits for the diagnosis of mixed-species
      malaria infections in southeastern Iran. A total of 100 malaria patients were
      included in the study out of 164 randomly suspected symptomatic malaria patients 
      from May to November 2012. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also used
      to judge the ability of microscopy versus RDT kits for detecting mixed species.
      The sensitivity of light microscopy for the detection of mixed-species malaria
      infections was 16.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3-49.1). Nested PCR revealed
      12 patients with mixed-species infection. The CareStart Pv/Pf Combo kit detected 
      58% of the mixed-species infections, which were determined by nested PCR
      (sensitivity = 58.3%; 95% CI = 28.5-83.5). For identifying P. falciparum, P.
      vivax, and mixed-species infections, the concordance rates (kappa statistics) of 
      microscopy and CareStart Pv/Pf Combo kit with nested PCR were 0.76 and 0.79,
      respectively (P = 0.001). This study underlines the effectiveness of RDT kits to 
      improve the differentiation of mixed-species malaria infections in endemic areas 
      where the prevalence of chloroquine resistance is high.

TI  - Microgeography and molecular epidemiology of malaria at the Thailand-Myanmar
      border in the malaria pre-elimination phase.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0712-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endemic malaria in Thailand continues to only exist along
      international borders. This pattern is frequently attributed to importation of
      malaria from surrounding nations. A microgeographical approach was used to
      investigate malaria cases in a study village along the Thailand-Myanmar border.
      METHODS: Three mass blood surveys were conducted during the study period (July
      and December 2011, and May 2012) and were matched to a cohort-based demographic
      surveillance system. Blood slides and filter papers were taken from each
      participant. Slides were cross-verified by an expert microscopist and filter
      papers were analysed using nested PCR. Cases were then mapped to households and
      analysed using spatial statistics. A risk factor analysis was done using mixed
      effects logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 55 Plasmodium vivax and 20
      Plasmodium falciparum cases (out of 547 participants) were detected through PCR, 
      compared to six and two (respectively) cases detected by field microscopy. The
      single largest risk factor for infection was citizenship. Many study participants
      were ethnic Karen people with no citizenship in either Thailand or Myanmar. This 
      subpopulation had over eight times the odds of malaria infection when compared to
      Thai citizens. Cases also appeared to cluster near a major drainage system and
      year-round water source within the study village. CONCLUSION: This research
      indicates that many cases of malaria remain undiagnosed in the region. The
      spatial and demographic clustering of cases in a sub-group of the population
      indicates either transmission within the Thai village or shared exposure to
      malaria vectors outside of the village. While it is possible that malaria is
      imported to Thailand from Myanmar, the existence of undetected infections,
      coupled with an ecological setting that is conducive to malaria transmission,
      means that indigenous transmission could also occur on the Thai side of the
      border. Improved, timely, and active case detection is warranted.

TI  - In vivo efficacy of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for the treatment of asymptomatic 
      parasitaemia in pregnant women in Machinga District, Malawi.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0710-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) intermittent
      preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) might be compromised by high 
      prevalence of resistance-associated Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
      (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) mutations. As a proxy for IPTp-SP
      effectiveness, the in vivo efficacy of SP to clear parasitaemia and prevent
      reinfection in asymptomatic parasitaemic pregnant women in an area with high SP
      resistance prevalence was assessed. METHODS: Pregnant women 16-26 weeks'
      gestation with asymptomatic parasitaemia presenting for antenatal care were given
      IPTp-SP and followed for 42 days. The primary outcome was polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) uncorrected 42-day survival rate; the per cent of patients without
      recrudescence or reinfection by day 42. PCR was used to distinguish recrudescence
      from reinfection. DNA was sequenced to detect resistance-associated dhfr and dhps
      mutations. RESULTS: Of 245 pregnant women included in the intention-to-treat
      analysis, 93.9% cleared their parasitaemia by day 7. The day 42 PCR-uncorrected
      survival rate was 58.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51.5-65.7) and day 42
      PCR-corrected survival was 68.7% (CI 61.4-76.0). Recrudescence was more common
      among primi- than among multigravid women; recrudescence rate 33.3% (CI
      25.1-42.4%) versus 21.4% (CI 15.0-29.0%) (log rank test p-value 0.006). The
      quintuple mutant was present in nearly all samples (95%), while 2% were sextuple 
      mutants with an additional mutation at dhps A581G. CONCLUSIONS: SP efficacy for
      acute malaria treatment has been compromised by resistance, but SP retains
      partial activity among pregnant women with asymptomatic parasitaemia, and thus
      might be useful for IPTp. Nonetheless, research on non-SP IPTp regimens should
      continue. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01120145 .

TI  - Modelling the potential of focal screening and treatment as elimination strategy 
      for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Peruvian Amazon Region.
PG  - 261

AB  - BACKGROUND: Focal screening and treatment (FSAT) of malaria infections has
      recently been introduced in Peru to overcome the inherent limitations of passive 
      case detection (PCD) and further decrease the malaria burden. Here, we used a
      relatively straightforward mathematical model to assess the potential of FSAT as 
      elimination strategy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Peruvian Amazon
      Region. METHODS: A baseline model was developed to simulate a scenario with
      seasonal malaria transmission and the effect of PCD and treatment of symptomatic 
      infections on the P. falciparum malaria transmission in a low endemic area of the
      Peruvian Amazon. The model was then adjusted to simulate intervention scenarios
      for predicting the long term additional impact of FSAT on P. falciparum malaria
      prevalence and incidence. Model parameterization was done using data from a
      cohort study in a rural Amazonian community as well as published transmission
      parameters from previous studies in similar areas. The effect of FSAT timing and 
      frequency, using either microscopy or a supposed field PCR, was assessed on both 
      predicted incidence and prevalence rates. RESULTS: The intervention model
      indicated that the addition of FSAT to PCD significantly reduced the predicted P.
      falciparum incidence and prevalence. The strongest reduction was observed when
      three consecutive FSAT were implemented at the beginning of the low transmission 
      season, and if malaria diagnosis was done with PCR. Repeated interventions for
      consecutive years (10 years with microscopy or 5 years with PCR), would allow
      reaching near to zero incidence and prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: The addition
      of FSAT interventions to PCD may enable to reach P. falciparum elimination levels
      in low endemic areas of the Amazon Region, yet the progression rates to those
      levels may vary substantially according to the operational criteria used for the 
      intervention.

AB  - Protective immunity to the liver stage of the malaria parasite can be conferred
      by vaccine-induced T cells, but no subunit vaccination approach based on cellular
      immunity has shown efficacy in field studies. We randomly allocated 121 healthy
      adult male volunteers in Kilifi, Kenya, to vaccination with the recombinant viral
      vectors chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA),
      both encoding the malaria peptide sequence ME-TRAP (the multiple epitope string
      and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein), or to vaccination with rabies
      vaccine as a control. We gave antimalarials to clear parasitemia and conducted
      PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis on blood samples three times a week to
      identify infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. On Cox
      regression, vaccination reduced the risk of infection by 67% [95% confidence
      interval (CI), 33 to 83%; P = 0.002] during 8 weeks of monitoring. T cell
      responses to TRAP peptides 21 to 30 were significantly associated with protection
      (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.75; P = 0.016).

TI  - High prevalence of dhfr and dhps molecular markers in Plasmodium falciparum in
      pregnant women of Nchelenge district, Northern Zambia.
PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0676-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended drug for
      intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) in most African countries, 
      including Zambia. However, malaria is still one of the leading causes of
      morbidity and mortality in pregnant women despite reports of greater than 50% of 
      women taking at least two doses of SP in IPTp. Studies have shown that resistance
      to SP is associated with mutations in the dhfr and dhps gene of Plasmodium
      falciparum. This study examined the prevalence of dhfr and dhps polymorphisms in 
      P. falciparum found in pregnant women of Nchelenge district. METHOD: This
      cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013 in Nchelenge, a holoendemic area with
      malaria prevalence estimated at 50% throughout the year. Three rural health
      centres were randomly selected and a census survey carried out at each health
      centre. A questionnaire was administered and malaria testing done using RDT and
      microscopy, with collection of a dried blood spot. A chelex extraction was done
      to extract parasite DNA from dried blood spots followed by nested PCR and enzyme 
      restriction digestion. RESULTS: Of the enrolled participants (n = 375), the
      median age of the women was 23. The prevalence of malaria by PCR was 22%. The PCR
      positive samples examined (n = 72) showed a high prevalence of dhfr triple
      (Asn-108 + Arg-59 + Ile-59) mutant (68%) and dhps double (Gly -437 + Glu-540)
      mutant (21%). The quintuple haplotype was found in 17% with 2 samples with an
      additional Gly-581mutation. In addition 6% mutations at Val-16 were found and
      none found at Thr-108 respectively, these both confer resistance to cycloguanil. 
      Multivariate analysis showed that there was an association between malaria and
      women aged 30-34 years old p < 0.05(AOR: 0.36) at 95% CI. CONCLUSION: This study 
      showed a high number of mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes. The high malaria
      endemicity in the general population of this area may have contributed to the
      high prevalence of resistant parasites in pregnant women, suggesting a need to
      examine the efficacy of SP given that it is the only approved drug for IPTp in
      Zambia.

TI  - Malaria continues to select for sickle cell trait in Central Africa.
PG  - 7051-4
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1505665112 [doi]
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that poses a serious health
      threat in tropical Africa, which the World Health Organization has declared a
      public health priority. Its persistence in human populations has been attributed 
      to the resistance it provides to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in its
      heterozygous state, called sickle cell trait (SCT). Because of migration, SCT is 
      becoming common outside tropical countries: It is now the most important genetic 
      disorder in France, affecting one birth for every 2,400, and one of the most
      common in the United States. We assess the strength of the association between
      SCT and malaria, using current data for both SCT and malaria infections. A total 
      of 3,959 blood samples from 195 villages distributed over the entire Republic of 
      Gabon were analyzed. Hemoglobin variants were identified by using HPLCy (HPLC).
      Infections by three species of Plasmodium were detected by PCR followed by
      sequencing of a 201-bp fragment of cytochrome b. An increase of 10% in P.
      falciparum malaria prevalence is associated with an increase by 4.3% of SCT
      carriers. An increase of 10 y of age is associated with an increase by 5.5% of
      SCT carriers. Sex is not associated with SCT. These strong associations show that
      malaria remains a selective factor in current human populations, despite the
      progress of medicine and the actions undertaken to fight this disease. Our
      results provide evidence that evolution is still present in humans, although this
      is sometimes questioned by scientific, political, or religious personalities.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and seroprevalence in asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum
      infections of Malagasy pregnant women in the highlands.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria epidemiology in Madagascar is classified into four different 
      areas, ranging from unstable seasonal transmission in the highlands to
      hyperendemic perennial transmission areas in the costal level. Most malaria
      studies in Madagascar are focused on symptomatic children. However, because of
      the low transmission in some areas with correspondingly low level of
      semi-immunity, adults are also at risk, in particular pregnant women. The
      objective of this study was to gain information on the genetic epidemiology of
      malarial infections in pregnant women in order to provide information for malaria
      control and elimination programmes in Madagascar. METHODS: Between May and August
      2010, we carried out cross-sectional surveys targeting healthy pregnant women in 
      six locations, three in the coastal area and three in the highlands at 850-1300
      m. 1244 blood samples were screened for anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies by 
      immunofluorescence test and for malarial infection by realtime-PCR. The
      prevalence of chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance markers was
      also determined in all Plasmodium falciparum samples by PCR-RFLP as well as the
      multiplicity of infection through genotyping six neutral microsatellites.
      RESULTS: In the highlands, 67.4% of the women presented antibodies against
      Plasmodium falciparum and 9.2% were carrying parasites, at the coast 95.6% and
      14.8%, respectively. In the mean, 1.2 clones were detected in infected pregnant
      woman in the highlands and 1.5 at the coast. A higher level of monoclonal
      infections was found in the highlands (85.4%) compared to the coast (61.8%).
      Resistance markers for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine were present only in two sites.
      CONCLUSION: Immunity is triggered in Malagasy highland populations when they are 
      infected with malaria parasites, but these populations could also serve as a
      reservoir for epidemics.

AB  - Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (IPTp-SP) has not been evaluated in the Republic of Congo since its
      implementation in 2006 and there is no published data on molecular markers of SP 
      resistance among Plasmodium falciparum isolates from pregnant women. This first
      study in this country aimed to describe the prevalence of dihydrofolate reductase
      (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) point mutations and haplotypes in P.
      falciparum isolates collected from pregnant women with asymptomatic infection.
      From March 2012 to December 2013, pregnant women attending Madibou health centre 
      (in Southern Brazzaville) for antenatal visits were enrolled in this study after 
      obtaining their written informed consent. Blood samples were collected and P.
      falciparum infections were characterized using PCR. A total of 363 pregnant women
      were enrolled. P. falciparum infection was detected in 67 (18.4%) samples as
      their PCR amplification of dhfr and dhps genes yielded bands and all the PCR
      products were successfully digested. Out of these 67 isolates, 59 (88%), 57 (85%)
      and 53 (79.1%) carried 51I, 59R and 108N dhfr mutant alleles, respectively. The
      prevalence of dhps 436A, 437G and 540E mutations were 67.1% (45/67), 98.5%
      (66/67) and 55.2% (37/67), respectively. More than one-half of the isolates
      carried quintuple mutations, with highly resistant haplotype dhfr51I/59R/108N +
      dhps437G/540E detected in 33% (22/67) whereas 25% (17/67) were found to carry
      sextuple mutations. We observed significantly higher frequencies of triple dhps
      mutations 436A/437G/540E and quintuple mutations dhfr51I/59R/108N+dhps437G/540E
      in isolates from women who received IPTp-SP than those who did not. Overall, this
      study shows high prevalence rates of SP-associated resistance mutations in P.
      falciparum isolates collected from pregnant women. The presence of the dhps
      mutant allele 540E and the high prevalence of isolates carrying quintuple
      dhfr/dhps mutations are here reported for the first time in the Republic of
      Congo. The increasing prevalence of multiple mutant alleles observed in this
      study is alarming and may present a challenge for the future interventions
      including IPTp-SP in the country.

TI  - Patterns of mixed Plasmodium species infections among children six years and
      under in selected malaria hyper-endemic communities of Zambia: population-based
      survey observations.
PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-0935-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although malaria is preventable and treatable, it still claims
      660,000 lives every year globally with children under five years of age having
      the highest burden. In Zambia, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that only
      detect Plasmodium falciparum are the main confirmatory means for malaria
      diagnosis in most health facilities without microscopy services. As a consequence
      of this P. falciparum species diagnostic approach, non-falciparum malaria is not 
      only under-diagnosed but entirely missed, thereby making the exact disease burden
      unknown. We thus investigated the prevalence of various Plasmodium spp. and
      associated burden of infection in selected communities in Zambia. METHODS: Data
      from two malaria hyper-endemic provinces (Eastern and Luapula) of the 2012
      National Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), conducted between April and May 2012,
      were used. The MIS is a nationally representative, two-stage cluster survey
      conducted to coincide with the end of the malaria transmission season. Social,
      behavioural and background information were collected from households as part of 
      the survey. Thick blood smears, RDTs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected
      from children below six years of age. Slides were stained using Giemsa and
      examined by microscopy while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse 
      the DBS for malaria Plasmodium spp. Multivariate logistic regression was employed
      to examine the association between background factors and malaria. RESULTS:
      Overall, 873 children younger than six years of age were surveyed. The overall
      prevalence of Plasmodium spp. by PCR was 54.3% (95% CI 51-57.6%). Of the total
      Plasmodium isolates, 88% were P. falciparum, 10.6% were mixed infections and 1.4%
      were non-falciparum mono infections. Among the mixed infections, the majority
      were a combination of P. falciparum and P. malariae (6.5% of all mixed
      infections). Children two years and older (2-5 years) had three-fold higher risk 
      of mixed malaria infections (aOR 2.8 CI 1.31-5.69) than children younger than two
      years of age. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of mixed Plasmodium spp. infections
      in this population stresses review of the current malaria RDT diagnostic
      approaches. The observed less incidence of mixed infections in children under two
      years of age compared to their older two-to-five-year-old counterparts is
      probably due to the protective maternal passive immunity, among other factors, in
      that age group.

TI  - Persistence of chloroquine-resistant haplotypes of Plasmodium falciparum in
      children with uncomplicated Malaria in Lagos, Nigeria, four years after change of
      chloroquine as first-line antimalarial medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Nigeria, despite the change in National malaria drug policy to
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in 2005 due to widespread chloroquine
      resistance, chloroquine (CQ) is still widely used in the treatment of malaria
      because it is cheap, affordable and accessible. The use of ACT for the management
      of uncomplicated malaria is currently being promoted. The employment of genetic
      markers to track circulating chloroquine-resistant parasites are useful in
      elucidating likely poor efficacy of chloroquine, especially in settings where it 
      is not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This
      study determined the prevalence of pfcrt haplotypes and point mutations in pfmdr1
      genes four years after the change in antimalarial treatment policy from CQ to the
      ACTs in Lagos, a commercial city in South-West, Nigeria. METHODS: This was a
      cross sectional study on uncomplicated malaria in children less than 12 years
      that presented with fever and other symptoms suggestive of malaria. Parasite DNA 
      was extracted from 119 patients out of 251 children who were positive for
      Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy and amplified. The occurrence of haplotypes
      was investigated in pfcrt gene using probe-based qPCR and single nucleotide
      polymorphisms in pfmdr1 gene using nested PCR. RESULTS: One hundred and nine
      (109) of the 119 children with P falciparum infection (91.6%) harbourd parasites 
      with the mutant pfcrt haplotype (CVIET). Out of this, 4.2% comprised a mixture of
      genotypes encoding CVMNK and CVIET, while 4.2% had the wild type (CVMNK).
      Furthermore, the frequency of point mutations in pfmdr1 was 62.2% and 69.0% for
      codons Y86 and F184 respectively. There were no mutations at codons 1034, 1042
      and 1246 of the Pfmdr1 genes. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of the CQ-resistant 
      haplotypes (CVIET) and mutations in Pfmdr1 associated with CQ resistance in P.
      falciparum among these children suggest that CQ-resistant parasites are still in 
      circulation. Continuous use of chloroquine may continue to increase the level of 
      mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1genes. There is need to strengthen current case
      management efforts at promoting ACT use as well as urgently restricting access to
      chloroquine by the National drug regulatory agency, National Agency for Food Drug
      Administration and Control (NAFDAC). VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for

TI  - Polymorphisms in the K13-propeller gene in artemisinin-susceptible Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites from Bougoula-Hameau and Bandiagara, Mali.

AB  - Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been documented in
      southeast Asia and may already be spreading in that region. Molecular markers are
      important tools for monitoring the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.
      Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PF3D7_1343700 kelch
      propeller (K13-propeller) domain were shown to be associated with artemisinin
      resistance in vivo and in vitro. The prevalence and role of K13-propeller
      mutations are poorly known in sub-Saharan Africa. K13-propeller mutations were
      genotyped by direct sequencing of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      amplicons from dried blood spots of pre-treatment falciparum malaria infections
      collected before and after the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      as first-line therapy in Mali. Although K13-propeller mutations previously
      associated with delayed parasite clearance in Cambodia were not identified, 26
      K13-propeller mutations were identified in both recent samples and pre-ACT
      infections. Parasite clearance time was comparable between infections with
      non-synonymous K13-propeller mutations and infections with the reference allele. 
      These findings suggest that K13-propeller mutations are present in
      artemisinin-sensitive parasites and that they preceded the wide use of ACTs in
      Mali.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the asymptomatic malaria parasite reservoir
      is a prerequisite to pursue malaria elimination efforts. We therefore
      characterised temporal trends and transporter polymorphisms in asymptomatic
      Plasmodium infections during the transition from high to low transmission in
      Zanzibar. METHODS: Healthy individuals participating in cross-sectional surveys
      conducted 2005-2013 were screened for asymptomatic malaria by PCR.
      Complexity/diversity of infection and transporter polymorphisms were assessed in 
      Plasmodium falciparum positive samples. Symptomatic samples were included for
      comparison of polymorphisms in 2013. RESULTS: PCR-determined parasite prevalence 
      declined from 21.1% (CI95% 17.4-24.9) to 2.3% (CI95% 1.7-2.9) from 2005 to 2013. 
      P. falciparum remained the predominant species; prevalence was highest in
      children and young adults aged 5-25 years. Parasite densities and complexity of
      infection, but not population genetic diversity of P. falciparum, decreased from 
      2005-2009. pfcrt 76T (99.2-64.7%, p < 0.001) and pfmdr1 86Y frequencies
      (89.4-66.7%, p = 0.03) decreased over time. Pfmdr1 (a.a.86,184,1246) YYY and YYD 
      haplotypes were more frequent in asymptomatic than symptomatic infections in 2013
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a declining, albeit persistent, reservoir of
      parasites present at low-densities in asymptomatic individuals in Zanzibar. This 
      study revealed important characteristics of the remaining parasite population,
      including intriguing temporal trends in molecular markers associated with
      antimalarial resistance, which need to be further investigated.

AB  - Malaria is a common parasitic disease in tropical countries, causing one to two
      million deaths every year. To establish the new biomarker, we analyzed plasma
      miRNAs obtained from 19 malaria patients and 19 normal subjects, using reverse
      transcription-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The average
      levels of plasma miR-451 and miR-16 were significantly lower in malaria patients,
      (8.9-fold; p <0.001 and 10.4-fold; p = 0.01, respectively). The levels of other
      abundant miRNAs in plasma (miR-223, miR-226-3p) did not change significantly in
      malaria patients. Our data suggest that plasma miR-451 and miR-16 are relevant
      biomarkers for malaria infection.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum in the southeastern Atlantic forest: a challenge to the
      bromeliad-malaria paradigm?
PG  - 181
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0680-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently an unexpectedly high prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was
      found in asymptomatic blood donors living in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic 
      forest. The bromeliad-malaria paradigm assumes that transmission of Plasmodium
      vivax and Plasmodium malariae involves species of the subgenus Kerteszia of
      Anopheles and only a few cases of P. vivax malaria are reported annually in this 
      region. The expectations of this paradigm are a low prevalence of P. vivax and a 
      null prevalence of P. falciparum. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify 
      if P. falciparum is actively circulating in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic
      forest remains. METHODS: In this study, anophelines were collected with Shannon
      and CDC-light traps in seven distinct Atlantic forest landscapes over a 4-month
      period. Field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes were tested by real-time PCR assay
      in pools of ten, and then each mosquito from every positive pool, separately for 
      P. falciparum and P. vivax. Genomic DNA of P. falciparum or P. vivax from
      positive anophelines was then amplified by traditional PCR for sequencing of the 
      18S ribosomal DNA to confirm Plasmodium species. Binomial probabilities were
      calculated to identify non-random results of the P. falciparum-infected
      anopheline findings. RESULTS: The overall proportion of anophelines naturally
      infected with P. falciparum was 4.4% (21/480) and only 0.8% (4/480) with P.
      vivax. All of the infected mosquitoes were found in intermixed natural and
      human-modified environments and most were Anopheles cruzii (22/25 = 88%, 18 P.
      falciparum plus 4 P. vivax). Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by sequencing in
      76% (16/21) of positive mosquitoes, whereas P. vivax was confirmed in only 25%
      (1/4). Binomial probabilities suggest that P. falciparum actively circulates
      throughout the region and that there may be a threshold of the forested over
      human-modified environment ratio upon which the proportion of P.
      falciparum-infected anophelines increases significantly. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results show that P. falciparum actively circulates, in higher proportion than P.
      vivax, among Anopheles mosquitoes of fragments of the southeastern Brazilian
      Atlantic forest. This finding challenges the classical bromeliad-malaria
      paradigm, which considers P. vivax circulation as the driver for the dynamics of 
      residual malaria transmission in this region.

AB  - Among 112 patients infected only by Plasmodium falciparum, WHO criteria of
      severity were compared with parasite load assessed by microscopy and quantitative
      PCR. Clinical severity was significantly correlated with higher parasite load as 
      determined by microscopy (p < 0.001) and by PCR (p < 0.001). Hence, quantitative 
      PCR might be useful to predict outcome.

TI  - Monitoring the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in Malawian children.
PG  - 175
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0701-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resistance of malaria parasites to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP) in 2007 led to the Malawi Ministry of Health changing to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as first-line for uncomplicated malaria treatment.
      This study determined the efficacy and safety of AL for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria among six to 59 months old Malawian
      children. METHODS: This was a prospective study of children six to 59 months old 
      treated with AL after presenting with uncomplicated malaria in the six health
      facilities in Malawi. The children were followed up on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21
      and 28 days post-treatment and assessed for clinical and parasitological
      responses. The Kaplan Meier survival estimate was used to measure the efficacy of
      AL by calculating the cumulative risk of failure at day 28. RESULTS: A total of
      322 children were recruited into the study across the six sites. The overall
      intention-to-treat (ITT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected cure rate was 
      93.4%. Per protocol overall PCR-corrected cure rates for the study sites were;
      Karonga 98.0%, Kawale 97.4%, Machinga 90.2%, Mangochi 95.4% and Rumphi 91.3%.
      Nkhotakota study site had the lowest cure rate of 78.0%. CONCLUSIONS: There is
      evidence of good efficacy of AL in Malawi notwithstanding geographical contrasts 
      and this supports the continued use of AL as the first-line treatment for
      uncomplicated malaria. However there may be need to further investigate the
      comparatively low efficacy rate found in Nkhotakota district in order to identify
      possible determinants of treatment failure.

TI  - Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial resistance-associated
      polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1 and pfnhe1 in Muheza, Tanzania, prior to
      introduction of artemisinin combination therapy.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0642-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A report of the chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance pfcrt-SVMNT
      haplotype in Tanzania raises concern about high-level resistance to the
      artesunate-amodiaquine combination treatment widely employed in Africa. Mutations
      in the pfmdr1 multi-drug resistance gene may also be associated with resistance, 
      and a highly polymorphic microsatellite (ms-4760) of the pfnhe1 gene involved in 
      quinine susceptibility has not been surveyed in Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 234
      samples collected between 2003 - 2006 from an observational birth cohort of young
      children in Muheza, Tanzania were analysed. In these children, 141 cases of P.
      falciparum infections were treated with AQ and 93 episodes were treated with QN. 
      Haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1 were determined by a Taqman assay, and ms-4760
      repeats in pfnhe1 were assessed by nested PCR amplification and direct
      sequencing. Parasite population diversity was evaluated using microsatellite
      markers on five different chromosomes. RESULTS: The pfcrt-CVIET haplotype was
      present alone in 93.6% (219/234) of the samples over the study period; the
      wild-type chloroquine- and amodiaquine-sensitive haplotype pfcrt-CVMNK was
      present in 4.3% (10/234) of the samples; and both haplotypes were present in 2.1%
      (5/234) of the samples. No significant change in wild-type pfcrt-CVMNK prevalence
      was evident over the 4-year period of the study. The pfcrt-SVMNT haplotype
      associated with high-level amodiaquine resistance was not detected in this study.
      The pfmdr1 locus was genotyped in 178 of these samples. The pfmdr1-YYNY haplotype
      predominated in 67.4% (120/178) of infections and was significantly associated
      with the pfcrt-CVIET haplotype. All samples carried the wild-type pfmdr1-N1042
      codon. The ms-4760 repeat on pfnhe1 locus displayed 12 distinct haplotypes with
      ms-4760-1 predominating in the population. Analysis of these haplotypes showed no
      association of a particular haplotype with quinine treatment outcome. CONCLUSION:
      The pfcrt-CVIET chloroquine resistance haplotype dominated in the collection of
      P. falciparum samples from Muheza. The pfcrt-SVMNT haplotype, which threatens the
      efficacy of amodiaquine and was reported in the same time period from Korogwe,
      Tanzania, 40 Km from Muheza, was not detected. Relative low prevalence of
      pfcrt-SVMNT in Africa may result from genetic or other factors rendering P.
      falciparum less supportive of this haplotype than in South America or other
      regions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Protocol Number: 08-I-N064.

TI  - Comparison of rapid diagnostic test Plasmotec Malaria-3, microscopy, and
      quantitative real-time PCR for diagnoses of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium 
      vivax infections in Mimika Regency, Papua, Indonesia.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0615-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends malaria be diagnosed by
      standard microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT) before treatment. RDTs have
      been used with greater frequency in the absence of matching blood slide
      confirmation in the majority of RDT reported cases in Mimika Regency, Papua
      Province, Indonesia. Given the importance of RDT in current health system as
      point-of-care tool, careful validation of RDT product performance for providing
      accurate malaria diagnosis is critical. METHODS: Plasmotec Malaria-3 (XW-P07)
      performance was evaluated by comparing it with paired blood film microscopy and
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Consecutive whole blood samples were derived
      from one clinic in Mimika as part of routine passive malaria case detection. RDT 
      results were read by two trained technicians and interpreted by consensus. Expert
      microscopic examination of blood slides was cross-checked by observer-blinded
      second reader and a third examiner if discordant between examinations. qPCR was
      used as the 'gold standard', followed by microscopy for the outcome/disease
      variable. Comparison analysis included sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp),
      positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV), and other diagnostic
      screening performance measures for detecting Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax infections. RESULTS: Overall malaria positive samples from qPCR was 42.2%
      (175/415 samples); and from matching blood slides 40.5% (168/415) of which those 
      infections with relatively low parasite densities </=100/mul blood was 5.7% of P.
      falciparum and 16.5% of P. vivax samples examined. Overall RDT performance when
      compared with microscopy for detecting P. falciparum was Sn:92%, Sp:96.6%,
      PPV:88%, NPV:97.8%, Kappa:0.87; and for P. vivax Sn:72.9%, Sp:99.1%, PPV:95.4%,
      NPV:93.4%, Kappa:0.79. Overall RDT performance when compared with qPCR for
      detecting P. falciparum was Sn:92%, Sp:96.6%, PPV:88%, NPV:97.8%, Kappa:0.87; and
      for P. vivax Sn:66%, Sp:99.1%, PPV:95.4%, NPV:90.9%, Kappa:0.73. CONCLUSIONS:
      Plasmotec Malaria-3 test showed good overall performance scores in precision for 
      detecting P. falciparum, but lower values regarding sensitivity and negative
      likelihood ratio for detecting P. vivax, a finding partly associated with greater
      frequency of lower density P. vivax infections compared to P. falciparum in this 
      study. In particular, the negative likelihood ratio (>0.1) for P. vivax detection
      indicates RDT lacked sufficient discriminating exclusion power falling below
      general acceptance criteria.

TI  - Splenic architecture disruption and parasite-induced splenocyte activation and
      anergy in Plasmodium falciparum-infected Saimiri sciureus monkeys.
PG  - 128

AB  - BACKGROUND: The understanding of the mechanisms of immunity in malaria is crucial
      for the rational development of interventions such as vaccines. During blood
      stage infection, the spleen is considered to play critical roles in both immunity
      and immunopathology of Plasmodium falciparum infections. METHODS: Saimiri
      sciureus monkeys were inoculated with blood stages of P. falciparum (FUP strain) 
      and spleens removed during acute disease (days 7 and 13 of infection) and during 
      convalescence (15 days after start of chloroquine treatment). Cytokine (IFNgamma,
      TNFalpha, IL2, IL6, IL10, and IL12) responses of splenocytes stimulated with P.
      falciparum-parasitized red blood cells were assessed by real-time PCR using
      specific Saimiri primers, and histological changes were evaluated using
      haematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa-stained slides. RESULTS: Early during infection
      (day 7, 1-2% parasitaemia), spleens showed disruption of germinal centre
      architecture with heavy B-cell activation (centroblasts), and splenocytes showed 
      increased expression of IFNgamma, IL6 and IL12 upon in vitro stimuli by P.
      falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (pRBC). Conversely, 15 days after
      treatment of blood stage infection with chloroquine, splenocytes showed
      spontaneous in vitro expression of TNFalpha, IL2, IL6, IL10, and IL12, but not
      IFNgamma, and stimulation with P. falciparum pRBC blocked the expression of all
      these cytokines. During the acute phase of infection, splenic disarray with
      disorganized germinal centres was observed. During convalescence, spleens of the 
      chloroquine-treated animals showed white pulp hyperplasia with extensive
      lymphocyte activation and persistency of heavily haemozoin-laden macrophages
      throughout the red pulp. CONCLUSIONS: Inability to eliminate haemozoin is likely 
      involved in the persistent lymphocyte activation and in the anergic responses of 
      Saimiri splenocytes to P. falciparum pRBC, with important negative impact in
      immune responses and implications for the design of malaria vaccine.

TI  - Transcription of the var genes from a freshly-obtained field isolate of
      Plasmodium falciparum shows more variable switching patterns than long
      laboratory-adapted isolates.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0565-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum involves switching among
      multicopy var gene family and is responsible for immune evasion and the
      maintenance of chronic infections. Current understanding of var gene expression
      and switching patterns comes from experiments conducted on long
      laboratory-adapted strains, with little known about their wild counterparts.
      METHODS: Genome sequencing was used to obtain 50 var genes from a parasite
      isolated from the China-Myanmar border. Four clones with different dominant var
      genes were cultured in vitro in replicates for 50 generations. Transcription of
      the individual var gene was detected by real-time PCR and then the switching
      process was analysed. RESULTS: The expression of multicopy var genes is mutually 
      exclusive in clones of a wild P. falciparum isolate. The activation of distinct
      primary dominant var genes leads to different and favoured switching patterns in 
      the four clones. The on/off rates of individual var genes are variable and the
      choice of subsequent dominant var genes are random, which results in the
      different switching patterns among replicates of each clonal wild P. falciparum
      isolate with near identical initial transcription profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study suggests that the switching patterns of var genes are abundant, which
      consist of both conserved and random parts.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Benguela
      province, Angola.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0634-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The malaria situation has been worsening in Angola, partly due to
      armed conflict until the recent past and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum.
      Malaria transmission is heterogeneous within the country, and data on
      drug-resistant malaria in different parts of the country are incomplete. The aim 
      of the present study was to evaluate resistance to 4-aminoquinolines and
      antifolate drugs in P. falciparum isolates collected in Benguela province,
      central Angola, using molecular markers. METHODS: Fingerprick capillary blood was
      collected from asymptomatic children aged less than 15 years old during a
      household survey in and around Balombo town in 2010-2011. Samples were screened
      for P. falciparum by nested PCR. Molecular markers (P. falciparum dihydrofolate
      reductase [pfdhfr], P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase [pfdhps], P.
      falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter [pfcrt], and P. falciparum
      multidrug-resistance gene 1 [pfmdr1]) were sequenced to determine the key codons 
      associated with drug resistance. RESULTS: A total of 60 blood samples were
      positive for P. falciparum. Most isolates with successful PCR amplification had
      mutant pfdhfr alleles, with either double mutant AICNI (69%) or triple mutant
      AIRNI (21%) haplotypes. A16V, S108T, and I164L substitutions were not found. Many
      of the isolates were carriers of either SGKAA (60%) or AGKAA (27%) pfdhps
      haplotype. K540E substitution was absent. There were only two pfcrt haplotypes:
      wild-type CVMNK (11%) and mutant CVIET (89%). Wild-type pfmdr1 NYSND haplotype
      was found in 19% of the isolates, whereas single mutant pfmdr1 YYSND and NFSND
      haplotypes occurred in 48% and 11%, respectively. Double mutant pfmdr1 haplotypes
      (YFSND and YYSNY) occurred rarely. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the high
      prevalence of mutant pfcrt CVIET haplotype is in agreement with low clinical
      efficacy of chloroquine observed in earlier studies and that the double pfdhfr
      mutant AICNI and single pfdhps mutant SGKAA are currently the predominant
      haplotypes associated with antifolate resistance in Benguela province. The
      hallmark of clinical resistance observed in East Africa, i.e. triple pfdhfr
      mutant haplotype (AIRNI) and double pfdhps mutant haplotype (SGEAA), was absent. 
      These molecular findings need to be further evaluated in parallel with clinical
      studies, in particular with the efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment
      using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in pregnant women and artesunate-amodiaquine for
      uncomplicated malaria.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates based on MSP-1 and MSP-2
      genes from Kolla-Shele area, Arbaminch Zuria District, southwest Ethiopia.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0604-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been extensively
      studied in various countries. However, limited data are available from Ethiopia. 
      This study was conducted to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity of P.
      falciparum in Kolla-Shele, in the southwest of Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 88
      isolates from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum attending Kolla-Shele
      Health Centre was collected from September to December, 2008. After extraction of
      DNA by Chelex method, the samples were genotyped by using nested-PCR of msp1
      (block 2) and msp2 (block 3) including their allelic families: K1, MAD20, RO33
      and FC27, 3D7/IC1, respectively. RESULTS: Allelic variation in both msp1 and msp2
      were identified in the 88 blood samples. For msp1 67% (59/88) and msp2 44%
      (39/88) were observed. K1 was the predominant msp1 allelic family observed in
      33.9% (20/59) of the samples followed by RO33 and MAD20. Of the msp2 allelic
      family 3D7/IC1 showed higher frequency (21.5%) compared to FC27 (10.3%). A total 
      of twenty-three alleles were detected; of which, eleven were from msp2 and twelve
      from msp2 genes. Fifty-nine percent of isolates had multiple genotypes and the
      overall mean multiplicity of infection was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.48-2.04). The
      heterozygosity index was 0.79 and 0.54for msp1 and msp2, respectively. There was 
      no statically significant difference in the multiplicity of infection by either
      age or parasite density (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This genetic diversity study
      showed the presence of five allelic types in the study area, with dominance K1 in
      the msp1 family and 3D7/IC1 in the msp2 family. Multiple infections were observed
      in nearly 60% of the samples.

TI  - Efficacy of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine + artesunate, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine +
      amodiaquine, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria in Mali.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin has been reported in 
      South-East Asia. Long half-life drugs are increasingly being used for malaria
      prevention. The potential spread of parasite resistance to these regimens is real
      and makes regular efficacy surveillance a priority. METHODS: From August to
      December 2004 and July to December 2005, a randomized open label trial of
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) + artesunate (AS) versus SP + amodiaquine (AQ),
      and SP alone, was conducted in two villages of Mali. PCR was used to distinguish 
      new infections from recrudescent P. falciparum infections. Patients were followed
      for 28 days to assess treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Overall 912 children aged
      between six to 59 months, with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were
      recruited. Baseline characteristics were similar in the three treatment arms.
      Crude ACPRs were 94.9%; 98.6% and 93.5% for SP + AS; SP + AQ and SP alone arms
      respectively (SP + AS versus SP + AQ, p = 0.01; SP + AS versus SP, p = 0.5; SP + 
      AQ versus SP, p = 0.001). After PCR adjustment, cACPRs were 99%; 100% and 97.2%
      for SP + AS; SP + AQ and SP alone arms, respectively (SP + AS versus SP + AQ, p =
      0.25; SP + AS versus SP, p = 0.12; SP + AQ versus SP, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION:
      Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine + amodiaquine therapy was as efficacious as
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine + artesunate, but more efficacious than
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum 
      malaria in Mali.

TI  - Direct venous inoculation of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites for controlled
      human malaria infection: a dose-finding trial in two centres.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0628-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) accelerates development of 
      anti-malarial interventions. So far, CHMI is done by exposure of volunteers to
      bites of five mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), a
      technique available in only a few centres worldwide. Mosquito-mediated CHMI is
      logistically complex, exact PfSPZ dosage is impossible and live mosquito-based
      interventions are not suitable for further clinical development. METHODS: An
      open-labelled, randomized, dose-finding study in 18-45 year old, healthy,
      malaria-naive volunteers was performed to assess if intravenous (IV) injection of
      50 to 3,200 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ is safe and achieves infection
      kinetics comparable to published data of mosquito-mediated CHMI. An independent
      study site verified the fully infectious dose using direct venous inoculation of 
      PfSPZ. Parasite kinetics were assessed by thick blood smear microscopy and
      quantitative real time PCR. RESULTS: IV inoculation with 50, 200, 800, or 3,200
      PfSPZ led to parasitaemia in 1/3, 1/3, 7/9, and 9/9 volunteers, respectively. The
      geometric mean pre-patent period (GMPPP) was 11.2 days (range 10.5-12.5) in the
      3,200 PfSPZ IV group. Subsequently, six volunteers received 3,200 PfSPZ by direct
      venous inoculation at an independent investigational site. All six developed
      parasitaemia (GMPPP: 11.4 days, range: 10.4-12.3). Inoculation of PfSPZ was safe.
      Infection rate and pre-patent period depended on dose, and injection of 3,200
      PfSPZ led to a GMPPP similar to CHMI with five PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes. The
      infectious dose of PfSPZ predicted dosage of radiation-attenuated PfSPZ required 
      for successful vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: IV inoculation of PfSPZ is safe, well
      tolerated and highly reproducible. It shall further accelerate development of
      anti-malarial interventions through standardization and facilitation of CHMI.
      Beyond this, rational dose selection for whole PfSPZ-based immunization and
      complex study designs are now possible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Monitoring of efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based anti-malarials for
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria: a review of evidence of implementation of
      anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy trials in Tanzania.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0649-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment are considered the
      cornerstones of malaria control and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      is currently the main anti-malarial drugs used for case management. After
      deployment of ACT due to widespread parasite resistance to the cheap and widely
      used anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine, the World
      Health Organization recommends regular surveillance to monitor the efficacy of
      the new drugs. The present paper assessed the implementation of anti-malarial
      efficacy testing for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of ACT for treatment of 
      uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania before and after policy changes in 2006.
      METHODS: A literature search was performed for published clinical trials
      conducted in Tanzania from 2001 to 2014. It focused on studies which assessed at 
      least one form of ACT for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      children less than 10 years and reported efficacy and safety of the tested
      anti-malarials. References were imported into the Endnote library and duplicates 
      removed. An electronic matrix was developed in Microsoft Excel followed by full
      text review with predetermined criteria. Studies were independently assessed and 
      information related to ACT efficacy and safety extracted. RESULTS: Nine papers
      were selected from 125 papers screened. The efficacy of both
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) against
      uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in Tanzania was high with PCR-corrected
      cure rates on day 28 of 91-100% and 88-93.8%, respectively. The highest day-3
      parasite positivity rate was 1.4%. Adverse events ranged from mild to serious but
      were not directly attributed to the drugs. CONCLUSION: ACT is efficacious and
      safe for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. However, few trials were
      conducted in Tanzania before and after policy changes in 2006 and thus more
      surveillance should be urgently undertaken to detect future changes in parasite
      sensitivity to ACT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the efforts of the National Malaria Control Programme,
      malaria remains as an important public health problem in Bangladesh, particularly
      in the south-eastern region bordering India. Successful malaria control
      strategies rely on a detailed understanding of the underlying causes of malaria
      transmission. Here, an entomological survey was conducted in a malaria endemic
      area of Bangladesh bordering India to investigate the Anopheles mosquito
      community and assess their Plasmodium infection status. METHODS: Monthly
      entomological collections were undertaken from October 2010 to September 2011 in 
      five villages in the Matiranga sub-district, Khagrachari district in Bangladesh, 
      bordering the Indian State of Tripura. CDC miniature light traps were placed
      inside houses to collect adult Anopheles mosquitoes. Following morphological and 
      molecular identification of the female Anopheles mosquitoes collected, they were 
      screened for circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf),
      Plasmodium vivax-210 (Pv-210) and Plasmodium vivax-247 (Pv-247), by ELISA to
      determine natural infection rates. Variation in Anopheles species composition,
      relative abundance and Plasmodium infection rates were analysed between sampled
      villages. RESULTS: A total of 2,027 female Anopheles were collected, belonging to
      20 species. Anopheles nivipes was the most abundant species in our test villages 
      during the peak malaria transmission season, and was observed sympatrically with 
      An. philippinensis in the studied area. However, in the dry off-peak season, An. 
      jeyporiensis was the most abundant species. Shannon's diversity index was highest
      in October (2.12) and evenness was highest in May (0.91). The CSP ELISA positive 
      rate overall was 0.44%. Anopheles karwari (n=2), An. barbirostris s.l. (n=1) and 
      An. vagus (n=1) were recorded positive for Pf. Anopheles kochi (n=1) was positive
      for Pv-210 while An. umbrosus (n=1), An. nivipes (n=1) and An. kochi (n=1) were
      positive for Pv-247. A mixed infection of Pf and Pv-247 was detected in An.
      barbirostris s.l.. CONCLUSION: High diversity of Anopheles species was observed
      in areas close to the international border where species that were underestimated
      for malaria transmission significantly outnumbered principal vector species and
      these may play a significantly heightened role in malaria transmission.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium vivax population before elimination of malaria in
      Hainan Province, China.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0545-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hainan Province is one of the most severe endemic regions with high
      transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in China. However, the
      incidence of P. falciparum and P. vivax has dropped dramatically since 2007 and a
      national elimination malaria programme (NEMP) was launched after 2010. To better 
      understand the genetic information on P. vivax population before elimination of
      malaria in Hainan Province, the extent of genetic diversity of P. vivax isolates 
      in Hainan Province was investigated using four polymorphic genetic markers,
      including P. vivax merozoite surface proteins 1, 3alpha, and 3beta (pvmsp-1,
      pvmsp-3alpha, and pvmsp-3beta) and circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp). METHODS:
      Isolates of P. vivax (n = 27) from Hainan Province were collected from 2009 to
      2010 and pvmsp-1 and pvcsp were analysed by DNA sequencing, respectively. Using
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were analysed 
      in pvmsp-3alpha, and pvmsp-3beta. RESULTS: The DNA sequencing analysis on pvmsp1 
      revealed that there were three allele types: Salvador-1 (Sal-1), Belem and
      recombinant (R) types. Among them, Sal-1 type was a dominant strain with eight
      variant subtypes (88.9%), whereas R- (3.7%) and Belem-type strains (7.4%) had one
      variant subtypes, respectively. All the isolates carried pvcsp with VK210 type
      accounting for 85.2% (23/27 isolates) and VK247 type accounting for 14.8% (4/27).
      Only type A and type B alleles were successfully amplified in pvmsp-3alpha gene, 
      and a high level of polymorphism was observed in pvmsp-3alpha. Considering
      pvmsp-3beta gene, type A was the predominant type in 17 isolates (63%), whereas
      type B was dominant in only ten isolates (37%). CONCLUSION: The present data
      indicate that there was high degree of genetic diversity among P. vivax
      population in Hainan Province of China during the pre-elimination stage of
      malaria, with 26 unique haplotypes observed among 27 samples.

TI  - Comparison of a PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic test and PCR for malaria in a low
      prevalence setting in rural southern Zambia: implications for elimination.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0544-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting histidine-rich protein 2
      (PfHRP2) antigen are used to identify individuals with Plasmodium falciparum
      infection even in low transmission settings seeking to achieve elimination.
      However, these RDTs lack sensitivity to detect low-density infections, produce
      false negatives for P. falciparum strains lacking pfhrp2 gene and do not detect
      species other than P. falciparum. METHODS: Results of a PfHRP2-based RDT and
      Plasmodium nested PCR were compared in a region of declining malaria transmission
      in southern Zambia using samples from community-based, cross-sectional surveys
      from 2008 to 2012. Participants were tested with a PfHRP2-based RDT and a finger 
      prick blood sample was spotted onto filter paper for PCR analysis and used to
      prepare blood smears for microscopy. Species-specific, real-time, quantitative
      PCR (q-PCR) was performed on samples that tested positive either by microscopy,
      RDT or nested PCR. RESULTS: Of 3,292 total participants enrolled, 12 (0.4%)
      tested positive by microscopy and 42 (1.3%) by RDT. Of 3,213 (98%) samples tested
      by nested PCR, 57 (1.8%) were positive, resulting in 87 participants positive by 
      at least one of the three tests. Of these, 61 tested positive for P. falciparum
      by q-PCR with copy numbers </= 2 x 10(3) copies/muL, 5 were positive for both P. 
      falciparum and Plasmodium malariae and 2 were positive for P. malariae alone. RDT
      detected 32 (53%) of P. falciparum positives, failing to detect three of the dual
      infections with P. malariae. Among 2,975 participants enrolled during a low
      transmission period between 2009 and 2012, sensitivity of the PfHRP2-based RDT
      compared to nested PCR was only 17%, with specificity of >99%. The pfhrp gene was
      detected in 80% of P. falciparum positives; however, comparison of copy number
      between RDT negative and RDT positive samples suggested that RDT negatives
      resulted from low parasitaemia and not pfhrp2 gene deletion. CONCLUSIONS:
      Low-density P. falciparum infections not identified by currently used
      PfHRP2-based RDTs and the inability to detect non-falciparum malaria will hinder 
      progress to further reduce malaria in low transmission settings of Zambia. More
      sensitive and specific diagnostic tests will likely be necessary to identify
      parasite reservoirs and achieve malaria elimination.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the Haem Oxygenase-1 promoter are not associated with severity
      of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 153
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0668-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catabolizes haem and has both cytotoxic and
      cytoprotective effects. Polymorphisms in the promoter of the Haem oxygenase-1
      (HMOX1) gene encoding HO-1 have been associated with several diseases including
      severe malaria. The objective of this study was to determine the allele and
      genotype frequencies of two single nucleotide polymorphisms; A(-413)T and
      G(-1135)A, and a (GT)n repeat length polymorphism in the HMOX1 promoter in
      paediatric malaria patients and controls to determine possible associations with 
      malaria disease severity. METHODS: Study participants were Ghanaian children
      (n=296) admitted to the emergency room at the Department of Child Health,
      Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana during the malaria season from June to
      August in 1995, 1996 and 1997, classified as having uncomplicated malaria (n=101)
      or severe malaria (n=195; defined as severe anaemia (n=63) or cerebral malaria
      (n=132)). Furthermore, 287 individuals without a detectable Plasmodium infection 
      or asymptomatic carriers of the parasite were enrolled as controls. Blood samples
      from participants were extracted for DNA and allele and genotype frequencies were
      determined with allele-specific PCR, restriction fragment length analysis and
      microsatellite analysis. RESULTS: The number of (GT)n repeats in the study
      participants varied between 21 and 46 with the majority of alleles having lengths
      of 26 (8.1%), 29/30 (13.2/17.9%) and 39/40 (8.0/13.8%) repeats, and was
      categorized into short, medium and long repeats. The (-413)T allele was very
      common (69.8%), while the (-1135)A allele was present in only 17.4% of the
      Ghanaian population. The G(-1135)A locus was excluded from further analysis after
      failing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. No significant differences in allele
      or genotype distribution of the A(-413)T and (GT)n repeat polymorphisms were
      found between the controls and the malaria patients, or between the disease
      groups, for any of the analysed polymorphisms and no associations with malaria
      severity were found. CONCLUSION: These results contribute to the understanding of
      the role of HMOX1/HO-1. This current study did not find any evidence of
      association between HMOX1 promoter polymorphisms and malaria susceptibility or
      severe malaria and hence contradicts previous findings. Further studies are
      needed to fully elucidate the relationship between HMOX1 polymorphisms and
      malarial disease.

TI  - Increased systemic exposures of artemether and dihydroartemisinin in infants
      under 5 kg with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria treated with
      artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem(R)).
PG  - 157
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0682-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) dispersible formulation was developed
      for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in infants and
      children weighing 5 to <35 kg. However, there are no clinical studies with
      artemisinin-based combination therapy in infants <5 kg. METHODS: This
      multicentre, open-label, single-arm study evaluated the efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetics of AL dispersible in infants aged >28 days and <5 kg of body
      weight, who were treated with one AL dispersible tablet (20 mg artemether/120 mg 
      lumefantrine) given twice-daily for three days and followed up for six weeks
      (core follow-up) and at 12 months of age (long-term follow-up). RESULTS: A total 
      of 20 patients were enrolled and completed the six-week core study follow-up. In 
      the per protocol population, PCR-corrected cure rate at days 28 and 42 was 100%
      (95% CI: 79.4, 100). AL dispersible was well tolerated with reported adverse
      events of mild to moderate severity. Pharmacokinetic data showed that
      lumefantrine levels were similar, however, artemether and dihydroartemisinin
      levels were on average two- to three-fold greater than historical values in
      infants and children >/=5 kg. CONCLUSIONS: A three-day regimen of AL dispersible 
      formulation was efficacious and generally well tolerated in infants weighing <5
      kg with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, but artemether and
      dihydroartemisinin exposures could not be supported by the preclinical safety
      margins for neurotoxicity. Hence, dosing recommendations cannot be made in
      infants <5 kg as implications for toxicity are unknown. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01619878.

TI  - Sibling species of the Anopheles funestus group, and their infection with malaria
      and lymphatic filarial parasites, in archived and newly collected specimens from 
      northeastern Tanzania.
PG  - 104
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0616-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the East African coast have shown a recent dramatic
      decline in malaria vector density and change in composition of sibling species of
      the Anopheles gambiae complex, paralleled by a major decline in malaria
      incidence. In order to better understand the ongoing changes in vector-parasite
      dynamics in the area, and to allow for appropriate adjustment of control
      activities, the present study examined the composition, and malaria and lymphatic
      filarial infection, of sibling species of the Anopheles funestus group. Similar
      to the An. gambiae complex, the An. funestus group contains important vectors of 
      both malaria and lymphatic filariasis. METHODS: Archived (from 2005-2012) and
      newly collected (from 2014) specimens of the An. funestus group collected indoors
      using CDC light traps in villages in northeastern Tanzania were analysed. They
      were identified to sibling species by PCR based on amplification of
      species-specific nucleotide sequence in the ITS2 region on rDNA genes. The
      specimens were furthermore examined for infection with Plasmodium falciparum and 
      Wuchereria bancrofti by PCR. RESULTS: The identified sibling species were An.
      funestus s.s., Anopheles parensis, Anopheles rivulorum, and Anopheles leesoni,
      with the first being by far the most common (overall 94.4%). When comparing
      archived specimens from 2005-2007 to those from 2008-2012, a small but
      statistically significant decrease in proportion of An. funestus s.s. was noted, 
      but otherwise observed temporal changes in sibling species composition were
      minor. No P. falciparum was detected in archived specimens, while 8.3% of the
      newly collected An. funestus s.s. were positive for this parasite. The overall W.
      bancrofti infection rate decreased from 14.8% in the 2005-2007 archived specimens
      to only 0.5% in the newly collected specimens, and with overall 93.3% of
      infections being in An. funestus s.s. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that the
      composition of the An. funestus group had remained rather stable during the study
      period, with An. funestus s.s. being the most predominant. The study also showed 
      increasing P. falciparum infection and decreasing W. bancrofti infection in An.
      funestus s.s. in the study period, most likely reflecting infection levels with
      these parasites in the human population in the area.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      among Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative populations in Ethiopia.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0596-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the most prevalent communicable disease in Ethiopia, with 
      75% of the country's landmass classified as endemic for malaria. Accurate
      information on the distribution and clinical prevalence of Plasmodium vivax and
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in endemic areas, as well as in Duffy-negative
      populations, is essential to develop integrated control strategies. METHODS: A
      total of 390 and 416 community and clinical samples, respectively, representing
      different localities and age groups across Ethiopia were examined. Malaria
      prevalence was estimated using nested PCR of the 18S rRNA region. Parasite gene
      copy number was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and compared between
      symptomatic and asymptomatic samples, as well as between children/adolescents and
      adults from the local community. An approximately 500-bp segment of the human
      DARC gene was amplified and sequenced to identify Duffy genotype at the -33rd
      nucleotide position for all the clinical and community samples. RESULTS:
      Plasmodium vivax prevalence was higher in the south while P. falciparum was
      higher in the north. The prevalence of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria is the 
      highest in children compared to adolescents and adults. Four P. vivax infections 
      were detected among the Duffy-negative samples. Samples from asymptomatic
      individuals show a significantly lower parasite gene copy number than those from 
      symptomatic infections for P. vivax and P. falciparum. CONCLUSIONS: Geographical 
      and age differences influence the distribution of P. vivax and P. falciparum
      malaria in Ethiopia. These findings offer evidence-based guidelines in targeting 
      malaria control efforts in the country.

TI  - Comparison of azithromycin plus chloroquine versus artemether-lumefantrine for
      the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in
      Africa: a randomized, open-label study.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0620-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, open-label study was conducted to establish the
      non-inferiority of a combination of azithromycin (AZ) and chloroquine (CQ) to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children
      from six sites in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Children with uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria between six and 59 months of age were randomized
      1:1 to either AZCQ (30 mg/kg AZ + 10 mg/kg CQ base) or AL per prescribing
      information for three days (Days 0, 1, 2). Each site could enrol in the study
      population once the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in five children five to
      12 years of age was deemed to be effective and well tolerated. The primary
      efficacy evaluation was the proportion of subjects in both the modified
      intent-to-treat (MITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations with an adequate
      clinical and parasitological response (PCR corrected) at Day 28. Non-inferiority 
      was concluded if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval comparing the two
      groups was 10 percentage points or greater. RESULTS: A total of 255 children were
      enrolled in the efficacy analysis (AZCQ, n = 124; AL, n = 131). The PCR corrected
      clearance rates were 89% (AZCQ) versus 98% (AL) for MITT, a difference of -9.10
      (95% confidence interval; -16.02, -2.18) and 93% (AZCQ) versus 99% (AL) for PP, a
      difference of -6.08 (-12.10, -0.05). Early and late treatment failures were more 
      common in subjects receiving AZCQ. Adverse events were more common in subjects
      treated with AZCQ. Drug concentrations obtained at specified time points
      following AZCQ administration had a large coefficient of variation partially due 
      to sparse sampling with sample collection time window. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, non-inferiority of AZCQ to AL was not demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Epidemiology of forest malaria in Central Vietnam: the hidden parasite reservoir.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0601-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After successfully reducing the malaria burden to pre-elimination
      levels over the past two decades, the national malaria programme in Vietnam has
      recently switched from control to elimination. However, in forested areas of
      Central Vietnam malaria elimination is likely to be jeopardized by the high
      occurrence of asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections as shown by previous
      reports. This paper presents the results of a malaria survey carried out in a
      remote forested area of Central Vietnam where we evaluated malaria prevalence and
      risk factors for infection. METHODS: After a full census (four study villages =
      1,810 inhabitants), the study population was screened for malaria infections by
      standard microscopy and, if needed, treated according to national guidelines. An 
      additional blood sample on filter paper was also taken in a random sample of the 
      population for later polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and more accurate estimation
      of the actual burden of malaria infections. The risk factor analysis for malaria 
      infections was done using survey multivariate logistic regression as well as the 
      classification and regression tree method (CART). RESULTS: A total of 1,450
      individuals were screened. Malaria prevalence by microscopy was 7.8% (ranging
      from 3.9 to 10.9% across villages) mostly Plasmodium falciparum (81.4%) or
      Plasmodium vivax (17.7%) mono-infections; a large majority (69.9%) was
      asymptomatic. By PCR, the prevalence was estimated at 22.6% (ranging from 16.4 to
      42.5%) with a higher proportion of P. vivax mono-infections (43.2%). The
      proportion of sub-patent infections increased with increasing age and with
      decreasing prevalence across villages. The main risk factors were young age,
      village, house structure, and absence of bed net. CONCLUSION: This study
      confirmed that in Central Vietnam a substantial part of the human malaria
      reservoir is hidden. Additional studies are urgently needed to assess the
      contribution of this hidden reservoir to the maintenance of malaria transmission.
      Such evidence will be crucial for guiding elimination strategies.

TI  - Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failure associated with a triple mutant including 
      kelch13 C580Y in Cambodia: an observational cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine has been adopted as first-line
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for multidrug-resistant Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in Cambodia because of few remaining alternatives. We aimed to
      assess the efficacy of standard 3 day dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment of
      uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, with and without the addition of primaquine, 
      focusing on the factors involved in drug resistance. METHODS: In this
      observational cohort study, we assessed 107 adults aged 18-65 years presenting to
      Anlong Veng District Hospital, Oddar Meanchey Province, Cambodia, with
      uncomplicated P falciparum or mixed P falciparum/Plasmodium vivax infection of
      between 1000 and 200,000 parasites per muL of blood, and participating in a
      randomised clinical trial in which all had received
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days, after which they had been randomly
      allocated to receive either primaquine or no primaquine. The trial was halted
      early due to poor dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine efficacy, and we assessed day 42
      PCR-corrected therapeutic efficacy (proportion of patients with recurrence at 42 
      days) and evidence of drug resistance from the initial cohort. We did analyses on
      both the intention to treat (ITT), modified ITT (withdrawals, losses to
      follow-up, and those with secondary outcomes [eg, new non-recrudescent malaria
      infection] were censored on the last day of follow-up), and per-protocol
      populations of the original trial. The original trial was registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01280162. FINDINGS: Between Dec 10, 2012, and Feb
      18, 2014, we had enrolled 107 patients in the original trial. Enrolment was
      voluntarily halted on Feb 16, 2014, before reaching planned enrolment (n=150)
      because of poor efficacy. We had randomly allocated 50 patients to primaquine and
      51 patients to no primaquine groups. PCR-adjusted Kaplan-Meier risk of P
      falciparum 42 day recrudescence was 54% (95% CI 45-63) in the modified ITT
      analysis population. We found two kelch13 propeller gene mutations associated
      with artemisinin resistance--a non-synonymous Cys580Tyr substitution in 70 (65%) 
      of 107 participants, an Arg539Thr substitution in 33 (31%), and a wild-type
      parasite in four (4%). Unlike Arg539Thr, Cys580Tyr was accompanied by two other
      mutations associated with extended parasite clearance (MAL10:688956 and
      MAL13:1718319). This combination triple mutation was associated with a 5.4 times 
      greater risk of treatment failure (hazard ratio 5.4 [95% CI 2.4-12]; p<0.0001)
      and higher piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentration (triple mutant 34 nM [28-41];
      non-triple mutant 24 nM [1-27]; p=0.003) than other infections had. The drug was 
      well tolerated, with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most common complaints. 
      INTERPRETATION: The dramatic decline in efficacy of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine compared with what was observed in a study at the 
      same location in 2010 was strongly associated with a new triple mutation
      including the kelch13 Cys580Tyr substitution. 3 days of artemisinin as part of an
      artemisinin combination therapy regimen might be insufficient. Strict regulation 
      and monitoring of antimalarial use, along with non-pharmacological approaches to 
      malaria resistance containment, must be integral parts of the public health
      response to rapidly accelerating drug resistance in the region. FUNDING: Armed

TI  - A serine-arginine-rich (SR) splicing factor modulates alternative splicing of
      over a thousand genes in Toxoplasma gondii.
PG  - 4661-75
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkv311 [doi]
AB  - Single genes are often subject to alternative splicing, which generates
      alternative mature mRNAs. This phenomenon is widespread in animals, and observed 
      in over 90% of human genes. Recent data suggest it may also be common in
      Apicomplexa. These parasites have small genomes, and economy of DNA is
      evolutionarily favoured in this phylum. We investigated the mechanism of
      alternative splicing in Toxoplasma gondii, and have identified and localized
      TgSR3, a homologue of ASF/SF2 (alternative-splicing factor/splicing factor 2, a
      serine-arginine-rich, or SR protein) to a subnuclear compartment. In addition, we
      conditionally overexpressed this protein, which was deleterious to growth.
      qRT-PCR was used to confirm perturbation of splicing in a known
      alternatively-spliced gene. We performed high-throughput RNA-seq to determine the
      extent of splicing modulated by this protein. Current RNA-seq algorithms are
      poorly suited to compact parasite genomes, and hence we complemented existing
      tools by writing a new program, GeneGuillotine, that addresses this deficiency by
      segregating overlapping reads into distinct genes. In order to identify the
      extent of alternative splicing, we released another program, JunctionJuror, that 
      detects changes in intron junctions. Using this program, we identified about 2000
      genes that were constitutively alternatively spliced in T. gondii. Overexpressing
      the splice regulator TgSR3 perturbed alternative splicing in over 1000 genes.

TI  - Submicroscopic and asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
      infections are common in western Thailand - molecular and serological evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a public health problem in parts of Thailand, where
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the main causes of infection. In
      the northwestern border province of Tak parasite prevalence is now estimated to
      be less than 1% by microscopy. Nonetheless, microscopy is insensitive at
      low-level parasitaemia. The objective of this study was to assess the current
      epidemiology of falciparum and vivax malaria in Tak using molecular methods to
      detect exposure to and infection with parasites; in particular, the prevalence of
      asymptomatic infections and infections with submicroscopic parasite levels.
      METHODS: Three-hundred microlitres of whole blood from finger-prick were
      collected into capillary tubes from residents of a sentinel village and from
      patients at a malaria clinic. Pelleted cellular fractions were screened by
      quantitative PCR to determine parasite prevalence, while plasma was probed on a
      protein microarray displaying hundreds of P. falciparum and P. vivax proteins to 
      obtain antibody response profiles in those individuals. RESULTS: Of 219 samples
      from the village, qPCR detected 25 (11.4%) Plasmodium sp. infections, of which
      92% were asymptomatic and 100% were submicroscopic. Of 61 samples from the clinic
      patients, 27 (44.3%) were positive by qPCR, of which 25.9% had submicroscopic
      parasite levels. Cryptic mixed infections, misdiagnosed as single-species
      infections by microscopy, were found in 7 (25.9%) malaria patients. All sample
      donors, parasitaemic and non-parasitaemic alike, had serological evidence of
      parasite exposure, with 100% seropositivity to at least 54 antigens. Antigens
      significantly associated with asymptomatic infections were P. falciparum MSP2,
      DnaJ protein, putative E1E2 ATPase, and three others. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest that parasite prevalence is higher than currently estimated by local
      authorities based on the standard light microscopy. As transmission levels drop
      in Thailand, it may be necessary to employ higher throughput and sensitivity
      methods for parasite detection in the phase of malaria elimination.

TI  - Selection and spread of artemisinin-resistant alleles in Thailand prior to the
      global artemisinin resistance containment campaign.
PG  - e1004789
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004789 [doi]
AB  - The recent emergence of artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion
      poses a major threat to the global effort to control malaria. Tracking the spread
      and evolution of artemisinin-resistant parasites is critical in aiding efforts to
      contain the spread of resistance. A total of 417 patient samples from the year
      2007, collected during malaria surveillance studies across ten provinces in
      Thailand, were genotyped for the candidate Plasmodium falciparum molecular marker
      of artemisinin resistance K13. Parasite genotypes were examined for K13 propeller
      mutations associated with artemisinin resistance, signatures of positive
      selection, and for evidence of whether artemisinin-resistant alleles arose
      independently across Thailand. A total of seven K13 mutant alleles were found
      (N458Y, R539T, E556D, P574L, R575K, C580Y, S621F). Notably, the R575K and S621F
      mutations have previously not been reported in Thailand. The most prevalent
      artemisinin resistance-associated K13 mutation, C580Y, carried two distinct
      haplotype profiles that were separated based on geography, along the
      Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders. It appears these two haplotypes may have 
      independent evolutionary origins. In summary, parasites with K13 propeller
      mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were widely present along the
      Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders prior to the implementation of the
      artemisinin resistance containment project in the region.

AB  - The transmission of malaria parasites depends on the presence of sexual stages
      (gametocytes) in the blood, making the ratio and densities of female and male
      gametocytes important determinants of parasite fitness. This manuscript describes
      the development of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to
      separately quantify mature female and male gametocytes of the human malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and reveals that Pfs25 mRNA is expressed only in 
      female gametocytes. The female (Pfs25) and male (Pfs230p) gametocyte specific
      RT-qPCR assays have lower detection limits of 0.3 female and 1.8 male gametocytes
      per microlitre of blood, respectively, making them more sensitive than
      microscopy. Accurate quantification of the ratio and densities of female and male
      gametocytes will increase understanding of P. falciparum transmission and improve
      the evaluation of transmission blocking interventions.

TI  - Low parasitemia in submicroscopic infections significantly impacts malaria
      diagnostic sensitivity in the highlands of Western Kenya.
PG  - e0121763
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0121763 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic malaria infections represent a major challenge in malaria control
      and elimination in Africa. They are reservoirs of malaria parasite that can
      contribute to disease transmission. Therefore, identification and control of
      asymptomatic infections are important to make malaria elimination feasible. In
      this study, we investigated the extent and distribution of asymptomatic malaria
      in Western Kenya and examined how varying parasitemia affects performance of
      diagnostic methods including microscopy, conventional PCR, and quantitative PCR. 
      In addition, we compared parasite prevalence rates and parasitemia levels with
      respect to topography and age in order to explore factors that influence malaria 
      infection. Over 11,000 asymptomatic blood samples from children and adolescents
      up to 18 years old representing broad areas of Western Kenya were included.
      Quantitative PCR revealed the highest parasite positive rate among all methods
      and malaria prevalence in western Kenya varied widely from less than 1% to over
      50%. A significantly lower parasitemia was detected in highland than in lowland
      samples and this contrast was also observed primarily among submicroscopic
      samples. Although we found no correlation between parasitemia level and age,
      individuals of younger age group (aged <14) showed significantly higher parasite 
      prevalence. In the lowlands, individuals of aged 5-14 showed significantly higher
      prevalence than those under age 5. Our findings highlight the need for a more
      sensitive and time-efficient assay for asymptomatic malaria detection
      particularly in areas of low-transmission. Combining QPCR with microscopy can
      enhance the capacity of detecting submicroscopic asymptomatic malaria infections.

TI  - In vivo antimalarial activity and mechanisms of action of 4-nerolidylcatechol
      derivatives.
PG  - 3271-80
LID - 10.1128/AAC.05012-14 [doi]
AB  - 4-Nerolidylcatechol (1) is an abundant antiplasmodial metabolite that is isolated
      from Piper peltatum roots. O-Acylation or O-alkylation of compound 1 provides
      derivatives exhibiting improved stability and significant in vitro antiplasmodial
      activity. The aim of this work was to study the in vitro inhibition of hemozoin
      formation, inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis in Plasmodium falciparum
      cultures, and in vivo antimalarial activity of several 4-nerolidylcatechol
      derivatives. 1,2-O,O-Diacetyl-4-nerolidylcatechol (2) inhibited in vitro hemozoin
      formation by up to 50%. In metabolic labeling studies using
      [1-(n)-(3)H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, diester 2: significantly inhibited the 
      biosynthesis of isoprenoid metabolites ubiquinone 8, menaquinone 4, and dolichol 
      12 in cultures of P. falciparum 3D7. Similarly, 2-O-benzyl-4-nerolidylcatechol
      (3) significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of dolichol 12. P. falciparum in
      vitro protein synthesis was not affected by compounds 2 or 3. At oral doses of 50
      mg per kg of body weight per day, compound 2 suppressed Plasmodium berghei NK65
      in infected BALB/c mice by 44%. This in vivo result for derivative 2 represents
      marked improvement over that obtained previously for natural product 1. Compound 
      2 was not detected in mouse blood 1 h after oral ingestion or in mixtures with
      mouse blood/blood plasma in vitro. However, it was detected after in vitro
      contact with human blood or blood plasma. Derivatives of 4-nerolidylcatechol
      exhibit parasite-specific modes of action, such as inhibition of isoprenoid
      biosynthesis and inhibition of hemozoin formation, and they therefore merit
      further investigation for their antimalarial potential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine is the most widely used artemisinin-based
      combination therapy for malaria, although treatment failures occur in some
      regions. We investigated the effect of dosing strategy on efficacy in a pooled
      analysis from trials done in a wide range of malaria-endemic settings. METHODS:
      We searched PubMed for clinical trials that enrolled and treated patients with
      artemether-lumefantrine and were published from 1960 to December, 2012. We merged
      individual patient data from these trials by use of standardised methods. The
      primary endpoint was the PCR-adjusted risk of Plasmodium falciparum recrudescence
      by day 28. Secondary endpoints consisted of the PCR-adjusted risk of P falciparum
      recurrence by day 42, PCR-unadjusted risk of P falciparum recurrence by day 42,
      early parasite clearance, and gametocyte carriage. Risk factors for PCR-adjusted 
      recrudescence were identified using Cox's regression model with frailty shared
      across the study sites. FINDINGS: We included 61 studies done between January,
      1998, and December, 2012, and included 14,327 patients in our analyses. The
      PCR-adjusted therapeutic efficacy was 97.6% (95% CI 97.4-97.9) at day 28 and
      96.0% (95.6-96.5) at day 42. After controlling for age and parasitaemia, patients
      prescribed a higher dose of artemether had a lower risk of having parasitaemia on
      day 1 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99 for every 1 mg/kg increase
      in daily artemether dose; p=0.024), but not on day 2 (p=0.69) or day 3 (0.087).
      In Asia, children weighing 10-15 kg who received a total lumefantrine dose less
      than 60 mg/kg had the lowest PCR-adjusted efficacy (91.7%, 95% CI 86.5-96.9). In 
      Africa, the risk of treatment failure was greatest in malnourished children aged 
      1-3 years (PCR-adjusted efficacy 94.3%, 95% CI 92.3-96.3). A higher artemether
      dose was associated with a lower gametocyte presence within 14 days of treatment 
      (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99; p=0.037 for every 1 mg/kg increase in total 
      artemether dose). INTERPRETATION: The recommended dose of artemether-lumefantrine
      provides reliable efficacy in most patients with uncomplicated malaria. However, 
      therapeutic efficacy was lowest in young children from Asia and young underweight
      children from Africa; a higher dose regimen should be assessed in these groups.

AB  - We assessed Plasmodium (P.) falciparum allelic diversity based on clinical
      severity and age. The study was conducted from 2011 to 2012 in Libreville, Gabon 
      where malaria prevalence was 24.5%. The polymorphism of the merozoite surface
      protein-1 (msp1) locus was analyzed in isolates from patients with complicated
      and uncomplicated malaria. Blood was collected on filter paper. After DNA
      extraction, genotyping of the msp1 gene was performed using nested PCR. The K1,
      Ro33, and Mad20 allelic families were detected in 71 (63%), 64 (57%), and 38
      (34%) of the 112 analyzed samples, respectively. Overall, 17 K1 and 11 Mad20
      alleles were detected. There was no association between msp1 allelic families and
      age. Mad20 allelic diversity increased with the severity of malaria. The number
      of K1 and Mad20 alleles decreased with age. The multiplicity of infection (MOI)
      was 1-6 genotypes and the complexity of infection (COI) 1.8 +/- 1. The COI
      differed based on age: it was 1.9 (+/-1.1) in the isolates from adults, 1.8
      (+/-1.1) in those from 0-5 year-old children, whereas it tended to be lower (1.6 
      +/- 0.8) in those from 6-15 year-old children. Extensive genetic diversity is
      found in P. falciparum strains circulating in Libreville. The number of specific 
      msp1 alleles increased with clinical severity, suggesting an association between 
      the diversity and the severity of malaria.

TI  - [Detection of Plasmodium falciparum by using magnetic nanoparticles
      separation-based quantitative real-time PCR assay].
PG  - 522-5, 530
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a magnetic nanoparticles separation-based quantitative
      real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for fast and accurate detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum and providing a technical support for improving the control and
      prevention of imported malaria. METHODS: According to the conserved sequences of 
      the P. falciparum genome 18SrRNA, the species-specific primers and probe were
      designed and synthetized. The RT-PCR was established by constructing the plasmid 
      standard, fitting the standard curve and using magnetic nanoparticles separation.
      The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were evaluated. RESULTS: The
      relationship between the threshold cycle (Ct) and logarithm of initial templates 
      copies was linear over a range of 2.5 x 10(1) to 2.5 x 10(8) copies/mul (R2 =
      0.999). Among 13 subjects of entry frontier, a P. falciparum carrier with low
      load was detected by using the assay and none was detected with the conventional 
      examinations (microscopic examinations and rapid tests). CONCLUSION: This assay
      shows a high sensitivity in detection of P. falciparum, with rapid and accurate
      characteristics, and is especially useful in diagnosis of P. falciparum infectors
      with low parasitaemia at entry-exit frontier ports.

TI  - Distinct mechanisms of inadequate erythropoiesis induced by tumor necrosis factor
      alpha or malarial pigment.
PG  - e0119836
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119836 [doi]
AB  - The role of infection in erythropoietic dysfunction is poorly understood. In
      children with P. falciparum malaria, the by-product of hemoglobin digestion in
      infected red cells (hemozoin) is associated with the severity of anemia which is 
      independent of circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
      alpha (TNF-alpha). To gain insight into the common and specific effects of
      TNF-alpha and hemozoin on erythropoiesis, we studied the gene expression profile 
      of purified primary erythroid cultures exposed to either TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) or 
      to hemozoin (12.5 mug/ml heme units) for 24 hours. Perturbed gene function was
      assessed using co-annotation of associated gene ontologies and expression of
      selected genes representative of the profile observed was confirmed by real time 
      PCR (rtPCR). The changes in gene expression induced by each agent were largely
      distinct; many of the genes significantly modulated by TNF-alpha were not
      affected by hemozoin. The genes modulated by TNF-alpha were significantly
      enriched for those encoding proteins involved in the control of type 1 interferon
      signalling and the immune response to viral infection. In contrast, genes induced
      by hemozoin were significantly enriched for functional roles in regulation of
      transcription and apoptosis. Further analyses by rtPCR revealed that hemozoin
      increases expression of transcription factors that form part of the integrated
      stress response which is accompanied by reduced expression of genes involved in
      DNA repair. This study confirms that hemozoin induces cellular stress on
      erythroblasts that is additional to and distinct from responses to inflammatory
      cytokines and identifies new genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of
      severe malarial anemia. More generally the respective transcription profiles
      highlight the varied mechanisms through which erythropoiesis may be disrupted
      during infectious disease.

AB  - To understand the effect of previous malaria exposure on antiparasite immune
      responses is important for developing successful immunization strategies.
      Controlled human malaria infections (CHMIs) using cryopreserved Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoites provide a unique opportunity to study differences in
      acquisition or recall of antimalaria immune responses in individuals from
      different transmission settings and genetic backgrounds. In this study, we
      compared antiparasite humoral and cellular immune responses in two cohorts of
      malaria-naive Dutch volunteers and Tanzanians from an area of low malarial
      endemicity, who were subjected to the identical CHMI protocol by intradermal
      injection of P. falciparum sporozoites. Samples from both trials were analyzed in
      parallel in a single center to ensure direct comparability of immunological
      outcomes. Within the Tanzanian cohort, we distinguished one group with moderate
      levels of preexisting antibodies to asexual P. falciparum lysate and another
      that, based on P. falciparum serology, resembled the malaria-naive Dutch cohort. 
      Positive P. falciparum serology at baseline was associated with a lower parasite 
      density at first detection by quantitative PCR (qPCR) after CHMI than that for
      Tanzanian volunteers with negative serology. Post-CHMI, both Tanzanian groups
      showed a stronger increase in anti-P. falciparum antibody titers than Dutch
      volunteers, indicating similar levels of B-cell memory independent of serology.
      In contrast to the Dutch, Tanzanians failed to increase P. falciparum-specific in
      vitro recall gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production after CHMI, and innate
      IFN-gamma responses were lower in P. falciparum lysate-seropositive individuals
      than in seronegative individuals. In conclusion, positive P. falciparum lysate
      serology can be used to identify individuals with better parasite control but
      weaker IFN-gamma responses in circulating lymphocytes, which may help to stratify
      volunteers in future CHMI trials in areas where malaria is endemic.

AB  - A prerequisite for reliable detection of low-density Plasmodium infections in
      malaria pre-elimination settings is the availability of ultra-sensitive and
      high-throughput molecular tools. We developed a SYBR Green real-time PCR
      restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (cytb-qPCR) targeting the
      cytochrome b gene of the four major human Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P.
      vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale) for parasite detection and species
      determination with DNA extracted from dried blood spots collected on filter
      paper. The performance of cytb-qPCR was first compared against four reference PCR
      methods using serially diluted Plasmodium samples. The detection limit of the
      cytb-qPCR was 1 parasite/mul (p/mul) for P. falciparum and P. ovale, and 2 p/mul 
      for P. vivax and P. malariae, while the reference PCRs had detection limits of
      0.5-10 p/mul. The ability of the PCR methods to detect low-density Plasmodium
      infections was then assessed using 2977 filter paper samples collected during a
      cross-sectional survey in Zanzibar, a malaria pre-elimination setting in
      sub-Saharan Africa. Field samples were defined as 'final positive' if positive in
      at least two of the five PCR methods. Cytb-qPCR preformed equal to or better than
      the reference PCRs with a sensitivity of 100% (65/65; 95%CI 94.5-100%) and a
      specificity of 99.9% (2910/2912; 95%CI 99.7-100%) when compared against 'final
      positive' samples. The results indicate that the cytb-qPCR may represent an
      opportunity for improved molecular surveillance of low-density Plasmodium
      infections in malaria pre-elimination settings.

TI  - Risk factors for malaria and adverse birth outcomes in a prospective cohort of
      pregnant women resident in a high malaria transmission area of Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 313-24
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trv019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW), anaemia and malaria are common in Papua New
      Guinean women. METHODS: To identify risk factors for LBW, anaemia and preterm
      delivery (PTD), pregnant women recruited into a cohort study in Madang, Papua New
      Guinea, were followed to delivery. RESULTS: Of 470 women enrolled, delivery data 
      were available for 328 (69.7%). By microscopy, 34.4% (113/328) of women had
      malaria parasitaemia at enrolment and 12.5% (41/328) at delivery; at each time
      point, PCR detected sub-microscopic parasitaemia in substantially more. Most
      infections were with Plasmodium falciparum; the remainder being predominantly P. 
      vivax. Anaemia and smoking were associated with lower birth weight, and LBW
      (16.7%; 51/305) and PTD (21.8%; 63/290) were common. Histopathologically
      diagnosed chronic placental malaria was associated with LBW (adjusted odds ratio 
      [aOR] 3.3; p=0.048) and PTD (aOR 4.2; p=0.01). Lack of maternal education
      predisposed to PTD. Sub-microscopic parasitaemia at delivery appeared to increase
      the risk of LBW. Of the genetic polymorphisms, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis,
      alpha(+)-thalassaemia and complement receptor 1 (CR1) deficiency, a CR1
      heterozygous genotype was associated with decreased risk of anaemia and
      substantial but non-significant effects were noted in other comparisons.
      CONCLUSIONS: In coastal Papua New Guinea, malaria and anaemia are important
      causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - The Effect of Storage and Extraction Methods on Amplification of Plasmodium
      falciparum DNA from Dried Blood Spots.
PG  - 922-5
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0602 [doi]
AB  - Extraction and amplification of DNA from dried blood spots (DBS) collected in
      field studies is commonly used for detection of Plasmodium falciparum. However,
      there have been few systematic efforts to determine the effects of storage and
      extraction methods on the sensitivity of DNA amplification. We investigated the
      effects of storage conditions, length of storage, and DNA extraction methods on
      amplification via three PCR-based assays using field samples and laboratory
      controls. Samples stored as DBS for 2 or more years at ambient temperature showed
      a significant loss of sensitivity that increased with time; after 10 years only
      10% samples with parasite densities > 1,000 parasites/muL were detectable by
      nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conversely, DBS and extracted DNA stored 
      at -20 degrees C showed no loss of sensitivity with time. Samples with low
      parasite densities amplified more successfully with saponin/Chelex compared with 
      spin-column-based extraction, though the latter method performed better on
      samples with higher parasite densities stored for 2 years at ambient temperature.
      DNA extracted via both methods was stable after 20 freeze-thaw cycles. Our
      results suggest that DBS should be stored at -20 degrees C or extracted
      immediately, especially if anticipating 2 or more years of storage.

AB  - The genome of the Plasmodium apicoplast, which has a higher copy number compared 
      with current targets for molecular diagnosis of malaria, appears to be a suitable
      target for detection of submicroscopic infections that are capable of sustaining 
      transmission. Novel primers targeting a conserved segment of the apicoplast
      (PFC10_AP|0010:rRNA) were designed and used in a number of different high
      throughput platforms such as single-step PCR (ssPCR), nested PCR (nPCR) and
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for parasite detection. Replicates 
      of ten-fold serial dilutions of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 DNA, with equivalent
      parasite density ranges of 200,000 to 0.2 parasites/muL, were used to determine
      the limit of detection and repeatability of each assay. A panel of 184 archived
      DNA samples extracted from either EDTA whole blood or dried blood spots, from
      across West Africa and South East Asia was used to determine the diagnostic
      performance of the assays. All assays amplified the 2 parasites/muL dilution
      except the ssPCR, which amplified two of the three replicates. Using an 18S rRNA 
      PCR as reference, the sensitivity was 98% (95% CI 93-100%) for the LAMP assay,
      87% (95% CI 79-93%) for ssPCR and 100% (95% CI 97-100%) for nPCR. Specificity was
      91% (95% CI 83-96%) for LAMP, 82% (95% CI 72-90%) for ssPCR and 66% (95% CI
      54-76%) for nPCR. The apicoplast genome-based nPCR detected more positive samples
      overall than the reference method. Discrepant samples were confirmed as true
      positives using a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR assay. The results show 
      that the apicoplast genome is a suitable target for molecular diagnosis of
      malaria.

TI  - Ecology of malaria infections in western lowland gorillas inhabiting Dzanga
      Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic.

LID - 10.1017/S0031182015000086 [doi]
AB  - African great apes are susceptible to infections with several species of
      Plasmodium, including the predecessor of Plasmodium falciparum. Little is known
      about the ecology of these pathogens in gorillas. A total of 131 gorilla fecal
      samples were collected from Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas to study the diversity 
      and prevalence of Plasmodium species. The effects of sex and age as factors
      influencing levels of infection with Plasmodium in habituated gorilla groups were
      assessed. Ninety-five human blood samples from the same locality were also
      analysed to test for cross-transmission between humans and gorillas. According to
      a cytB PCR assay 32% of gorilla's fecal samples and 43.1% human individuals were 
      infected with Plasmodium spp. All Laverania species, Plasmodium vivax, and for
      the first time Plasmodium ovale were identified from gorilla samples. Plasmodium 
      praefalciparum was present only from habituated individuals and P. falciparum was
      detected from human samples. Although few P. vivax and P. ovale sequences were
      obtained from gorillas, the evidence for cross-species transmission between
      humans and gorillas requires more in depth analysis. No association was found
      between malaria infection and sex, however, younger individuals aged </=6 years
      were more susceptible. Switching between two different Plasmodium spp. was
      observed in three individuals. Prolonged monitoring of Plasmodium infection
      during various seasons and recording behavioural data is necessary to draw a
      precise picture about the infection dynamics.

TI  - Ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum by amplification of multi-copy
      subtelomeric targets.
PG  - e1001788
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001788 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Planning and evaluating malaria control strategies relies on accurate
      definition of parasite prevalence in the population. A large proportion of
      asymptomatic parasite infections can only be identified by surveillance with
      molecular methods, yet these infections also contribute to onward transmission to
      mosquitoes. The sensitivity of molecular detection by PCR is limited by the
      abundance of the target sequence in a DNA sample; thus, detection becomes
      imperfect at low densities. We aimed to increase PCR diagnostic sensitivity by
      targeting multi-copy genomic sequences for reliable detection of low-density
      infections, and investigated the impact of these PCR assays on community
      prevalence data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were
      developed for ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum, targeting the
      high-copy telomere-associated repetitive element 2 (TARE-2, approximately 250
      copies/genome) and the var gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS, 59
      copies/genome). Our assays reached a limit of detection of 0.03 to 0.15
      parasites/mul blood and were 10x more sensitive than standard 18S rRNA qPCR. In a
      population cross-sectional study in Tanzania, 295/498 samples tested positive
      using ultra-sensitive assays. Light microscopy missed 169 infections (57%). 18S
      rRNA qPCR failed to identify 48 infections (16%), of which 40% carried
      gametocytes detected by pfs25 quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. To judge
      the suitability of the TARE-2 and varATS assays for high-throughput screens,
      their performance was tested on sample pools. Both ultra-sensitive assays
      correctly detected all pools containing one low-density P. falciparum-positive
      sample, which went undetected by 18S rRNA qPCR, among nine negatives. TARE-2 and 
      varATS qPCRs improve estimates of prevalence rates, yet other infections might
      still remain undetected when absent in the limited blood volume sampled.
      CONCLUSIONS: Measured malaria prevalence in communities is largely determined by 
      the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used. Even when applying standard
      molecular diagnostics, prevalence in our study population was underestimated by
      8% compared to the new assays. Our findings highlight the need for highly
      sensitive tools such as TARE-2 and varATS qPCR in community surveillance and for 
      monitoring interventions to better describe malaria epidemiology and inform
      malaria elimination efforts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
      protein (PfHRP) II and III. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples 
      of 20 patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum in Yunnan Province. Blood
      samples were tested by microscopy and RDTs. The Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 gene fragments 
      were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The sequencing results were analyzed and
      compared using the bioinformatics software. RESULTS: 20 patients infected with
      Plasmodium falciparum tested by microscopy and RDTs. PCR showed that the Pfhrp2
      gene was with 389~986 bp, and Pfhrp3 gene with 329-640 bp. All PfH-IRP II
      sequences started with type 1 repeat (AHHAHHVAD) and ended with the type 12
      repeat (AHHAAAHHEAATH). The number of type 7 (AHHAAD), type 2 (AHHAHHAAD) and
      type 6 (AHHATD) within PfHRP II was more than the other types of repeats, as well
      as type 16 (AHHAAN) and type 17 (AHHDG) for PfHRP III. Type 11 repeat (AHN) was
      not found from the PfHRP II and PfHRP III sequences. CONCLUSION: There is an
      extensive diversity in Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 fragments in the individuals infected
      with P. falciparum in Yunnan. Some types of repeats are shared by PfHRP II and
      PfHRP III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone and express the DBL domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite
      surface protein MSPDBL2(DBL2), and investigate its antigenicity. METHODS: The
      DBL2 fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET28a vector. The recombinant
      pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and protein
      expression was induced by IPTG. The expressed product was purified by Ni-NTA
      affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RESULTS: 
      DBL2 gene fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein MSPDBL2
      (950 bp) was obtained by PCR. The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was identified 
      by PCR, double enzyme digestion, and DNA sequencing. The recombinant DBL2 protein
      was expressed in an inclusion body form with Mr 340,000 after being induced with 
      IPTG. Moreover, the purified recombinant DBL2 protein was recognized by sera from
      patients with falciparum malaria. CONCLUSION: The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid
      has been constructed. The purified rDBL2 protein shows adequate antigenicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic diversity of apical membrane antigen-1 gene from 
      Plasmodium falciparum (PfAMA-1). METHODS: Filter paper blood samples were
      collected from 23 imported P. falciparum malaria patients who returned to Fujian 
      Province from 2006 to 2012. Nested PCR were used to amplify the PfAMA-1 gene. The
      umplified fragments were sequenced, and analyzed by bioinformatic software.
      RESULTS: All 23 samples were amplified a 505 bp band. Thirty-two nucleotides were
      found to be variable, resulting in 18 haplotypes. Eight of these 18 halotypes
      were being reported here for the first time. The parasites collected from Africa 
      showed the higher level of variability [haplotypes diversity (Hd)= 0.0985,
      nucleotide diversity (pi)=0.0258] as compared to the isolates from Asia
      (Hd=0.909, pi=0.0221). The average difference of dN-dS for all 23 PfAMA-1
      sequences was 0.031+/-0.006. Sequence-based neutrality tests were not significant
      in Africa and Asia (P>0.05). The minimum number of recombination events (Rm) was 
      10, and the linkage disequilibrium index (R2) evidently declined with the
      increase of nucleotide distance. A molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using 
      the neighbor-joining method showed that the 23 isolates were assigned to three
      clades (G1, G2 and G3). Most samples from Africa formed G1, and G3 contained most
      of Asian isolates. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Africa show a 
      higher genetic diversity than the isolates from Asia for PfAMA-1 gene.

AB  - In Sudan, Plasmodium vivax accounts for approximately 5-10% of malaria cases.
      This study was carried out to determine the genetic diversity of P. vivax
      population from Sudan by analyzing the polymorphism of P. vivax csp (pvcsp) and
      pvmsp-3alpha genes. Blood samples (n=76) were taken from suspected malaria cases 
      from 2012-2013 in three health centers of Eastern and Central Sudan. Parasite
      detection was performed by microscopy and molecular techniques, and genotyping of
      both genes was performed by PCR-RFLP followed by DNA sequence for only pvcsp gene
      (n=30). Based on microscopy analysis, 76 (%100) patients were infected with P.
      vivax, whereas nested-PCR results showed that 86.8% (n=66), 3.9% (n=3), and 3.9% 
      (n=3) of tested samples had P. vivax as well as Plasmodium falciparum mono- and
      mixed infections, respectively. Four out of 76 samples had no results in
      molecular diagnosis. All sequenced samples were found to be of VK210 (100%)
      genotype with six distinct amino acid haplotypes, and 210A (66.7%) was the most
      prevalent haplotype. The Sudanese isolates displayed variations in the peptide
      repeat motifs (PRMs) ranging from 17 to 19 with GDRADGQPA (PRM1), GDRAAGQPA
      (PRM2) and DDRAAGQPA (PRM3). Also, 54 polymorphic sites with 56 mutations were
      found in repeat and post-repeat regions of the pvcsp and the overall nucleotide
      diversity (pi) was 0.02149+/-0.00539. A negative value of dN-dS (-0.0344) was
      found that suggested a significant purifying selection of Sudanese pvcsp, (Z
      test, P<0.05). Regarding pvmsp-3alpha, three types were detected: types A (94.6%,
      52/55), type C (3.6%, 2/55), and type B (1.8%, 1/55). No multiclonal infections
      were detected, and RFLP analysis identified 13 (Hha I, A1-A11, B1, and C1) and 16
      (Alu I, A1-A14, B1, and C1) distinct allelic forms. In conclusion, genetic
      investigation among Sudanese P. vivax isolates indicated that this antigen showed
      limited antigenic diversity.

LID - 10.15537/smj.2015.2.10874 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of mixed-species (MS) malaria infection, 
      and compare the results with microscopically confirmed cases of malaria. METHODS:
      During 2010, blood spots collected from 371 clinically suspected cases of malaria
      were microscopically examined in a cross-sectional study. The DNA was extracted
      from the samples, and a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. The
      results obtained by the 2 methods were compared. RESULTS: From the microscopic
      analysis it was determined that 369 samples (99.5%) were positive for Plasmodium 
      falciparum (P. falciparum) and 2 were Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax)
      mono-infections. There were no mixed malaria infections. The PCR analysis,
      however, showed that in 7 cases (1.9%) the infection was caused by MS malaria
      comprising of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 2 of these representing the cases that 
      were microscopically diagnosed as P. vivax mono-infections. All cases were
      negative for Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium knowlesi.
      CONCLUSION: Mixed malaria infections are currently overlooked when using
      microscopy. The PCR assays are essential complementary techniques that should be 
      used with microscopic examination of blood smears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the first evidence of sympatric distribution of Plasmodium 
      ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri from India. METHODS: Fingerprick blood
      samples were collected from fever cases in district Bastar, Chhattisgarh State
      for malaria screening by microscopy and PCR. RESULTS: Two cases of mono infection
      of P. ovale, and a fatal case of cerebral malaria with a mixed infection of P.
      vivax, P. falciparum and P. ovale were confirmed by PCR. Sequencing analysis
      revealed the presence of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study highlights the need of molecular diagnosis of malaria cases in
      forested areas for treatment and control.

TI  - Asymptomatic Multiclonal Plasmodium falciparum Infections Carried Through the Dry
      Season Predict Protection Against Subsequent Clinical Malaria.
PG  - 608-16
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiv088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunity to the antigenically diverse parasite Plasmodium falciparum 
      is acquired gradually after repeated exposure. Studies in areas of high malaria
      transmission have shown that asymptomatic individuals infected with multiclonal
      infections are at reduced risk of febrile malaria during follow-up. METHODS: We
      assessed the relationship between the genetic diversity of clones in P.
      falciparum infections that persist through the dry season and the subsequent risk
      of febrile malaria in 225 individuals aged 2-25 years in Mali, where the 6-month 
      malaria and dry seasons are sharply demarcated. Polymerase chain reaction-based
      genotyping of the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2 gene was
      performed on blood samples collected at 5 cross-sectional surveys. RESULTS: In an
      age-adjusted analysis, individuals with multiclonal P. falciparum infections
      before the rainy season were at reduced risk of febrile malaria, compared with
      individuals who were uninfected (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], .11-.69). In contrast, there was no significant association between risk of
      malaria and having 1 clone at baseline (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, .36-1.40). CONCLUSIONS:
      The results suggest that persistent multiclonal infections carried through the
      dry season contribute to protection against subsequent febrile malaria, possibly 
      by maintaining protective immune responses that depend on ongoing parasite
      infection.

TI  - Polymorphisms of the Pfatpase 6 and Pfcrt gene and their relationship with the in
      vitro susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin and chloroquine of Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates from Abobo, Cote d'Ivoire.
PG  - 259-66
AB  - As a result of widespread resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has 
      been recommended as a first-line anti-malarial regimen in Cote d'Ivoire since
      2005. A thorough understanding of the molecular bases of P. falciparum resistance
      to existing drugs is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to analyze the
      in vitro sensitivity of P. falciparum field isolates from Abobo to CQ,
      pyronaridine (PYR) and dihydroartemisinine (DHA), and to investigate the
      polymorphisms associated with drug resistance. The standard in vitro drug
      sensitivity microtechnique recommended by the WHO was used to assess the
      sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected in December 2006. The
      Pfcrt haplotype 76 was analysed by PCR-RFLP while Pfatpase 6 amplification
      products were sequenced. Associations between drug sensitivity and parasite gene 
      polymorphisms were evaluated with Cohen's kappa test. The correlation between the
      IC50 values for different drugs was assessed by the coefficient of determination 
      (r(2)). Significance was assumed at p<0.05. Of 128 in vitro tests performed, 112 
      (87.5%) were successful. Of the isolates, 56.2% were resistant for CQ and 48% for
      PYR. One isolate (3.6%) demonstrated reduced DHA sensitivity (IC50 higher than 10
      nM). The mutant K76T pfcrt codon, present in 90% of DNA fragments analyzed, was
      associated with CQ-R (k=0.76). The N669Y (16.1%), D734Y (28.6%) and D734H (1.8%) 
      isolates were found to have mutant Pfatpase6, however, these mutations were not
      associated with diminished DHA sensitivity (k=0.01). These high levels of
      antimalarial drug resistance in Abobo (Cote d'Ivoire) demand further studies of
      drug efficacy across the whole country.

TI  - Artemisinin-naphthoquine for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria.
PG  - CD011547
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based
      combination therapy (ACT) for treating people with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
      Five combinations are currently recommended, all administered over three days.
      Artemisinin-naphthoquine is a new combination developed in China, which is being 
      marketed as a one-day treatment. Although shorter treatment courses may improve
      adherence, the WHO recommends at least three days of the short-acting artemisinin
      component to eliminate 90% P. falciparum parasites in the bloodstream, before
      leaving the longer-acting partner drug to clear the remaining parasites.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the artemisinin-naphthoquine
      combination for treating adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group
      Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
      published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; and LILACS up to January
      2015. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) using
      'malaria' and 'arte* OR dihydroarte*' as search terms. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomized controlled trials comparing artemisinin-naphthoquine combinations with
      established WHO-recommended ACTs for the treatment of adults and children with
      uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two
      review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias,
      and extracted data. We analysed primary outcomes in line with the WHO 'Protocol
      for assessing and monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy' and compared drugs using
      risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary outcomes were
      effects on gametocytes, haemoglobin, and adverse events. We assessed the quality 
      of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials, enrolling 740
      adults and children, met the inclusion criteria. Artemisinin-naphthoquine was
      administered as a single dose (two trials), as two doses given eight hours apart 
      (one trial), and once daily for three days (one trial), and compared to three-day
      regimens of established ACTs. Three additional small pharmaceutical company
      trials have been carried out. We have requested the data but have not received a 
      response from the company. Artemisinin-naphthoquine versus
      artemether-lumefantrineIn three small trials from Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua
      New Guinea, both combinations had a very low incidence of treatment failure at
      Day 28, and there were no differences demonstrated in PCR-unadjusted, or
      PCR-adjusted treatment failure (three trials, 487 participants, low quality
      evidence). Only the single study from Papua New Guinea followed participants up
      to Day 42, and the number of treatment failures remained very low with both
      combinations (one trial, 186 participants, very low quality evidence).
      Artemisinin-naphthoquine versus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquineIn a single small
      trial from Indonesia, treatment failure at Day 28 and Day 42 was very low in both
      groups with no differences demonstrated (one trial, 144 participants, very low
      quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of these few trials of
      artemisinin-naphthoquine are promising, but further trials from multiple settings
      are required to reliably demonstrate the relative efficacy and safety compared to
      established ACTs. Future trials should be adequately powered to demonstrate
      non-inferiority, and regimens incorporating three days of the artemisinin
      component are probably preferable to the one-day regimens.

TI  - Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum Infections Are Associated With Maternal
      Anemia, Premature Births, and Low Birth Weight.
PG  - 1481-8
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular, as opposed to microscopic, detection measures the real
      prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Such occult infections are common
      during pregnancy but their impact on pregnancy outcomes is unclear. We performed 
      a longitudinal study to describe that impact. METHODS: In a cohort of 1037
      Beninese pregnant women, we used ultrasound to accurately estimate gestational
      ages. Infection with P. falciparum, hemoglobin concentration, use of intermittent
      preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) for malaria, and other parameters
      were recorded during pregnancy. Using multivariate analyses, we evaluated the
      impact of submicroscopic infections on maternal anemia, premature birth, and low 
      birth weight. RESULTS: At inclusion, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      microscopy detected infection in 40% and 16% of women, respectively. The
      proportion infected declined markedly after 2 doses of IPTp but rebounded to 34% 
      (by PCR) at delivery. Submicroscopic infections during pregnancy were associated 
      with lower mean hemoglobin irrespective of gravidity, and with increased anemia
      risk in primigravidae (odds ratio [OR], 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      .98-5.07). Prospectively, submicroscopic infections at inclusion were associated 
      with significantly increased risks of low birth weight in primigravidae (OR,
      6.09; 95% CI, 1.16-31.95) and premature births in multigravidae (OR, 2.25; 95%
      CI, 1.13-4.46). CONCLUSIONS: In this detailed longitudinal study, we document the
      deleterious impact of submicroscopic P. falciparum parasitemia during pregnancy
      on multiple pregnancy outcomes. Parasitemia occurs frequently during pregnancy,
      but routine microscopic and rapid diagnostic tests fail to detect the vast
      majority of episodes. Our findings imply caution in any revision of the current
      strategies for prevention of pregnancy-associated malaria.

      the kelch13 molecular marker.
PG  - 2548-53
LID - 10.1128/AAC.04632-14 [doi]
AB  - Malaria treatment in Southeast Asia is threatened with the emergence of
      artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Genome association studies have
      strongly linked a locus on P. falciparum chromosome 13 to artemisinin resistance,
      and recently, mutations in the kelch13 propeller region (Pfk-13) were strongly
      linked to resistance. To date, this information has not been shown in Indian
      samples. Pfk-13 mutations were assessed in samples from efficacy studies of
      artemisinin combination treatments in India. Samples were PCR amplified and
      sequenced from codon 427 to 727. Out of 384 samples, nonsynonymous mutations in
      the propeller region were found in four patients from the northeastern states,
      but their presence did not correlate with ACT treatment failures. This is the
      first report of Pfk-13 point mutations from India. Further phenotyping and
      genotyping studies are required to assess the status of artemisinin resistance in
      this region.

TI  - The Mu subunit of Plasmodium falciparum clathrin-associated adaptor protein 2
      modulates in vitro parasite response to artemisinin and quinine.
PG  - 2540-7
LID - 10.1128/AAC.04067-14 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of drug-resistant parasites is a serious threat faced by malaria
      control programs. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance is critical to
      the success of treatment and intervention strategies. A novel locus associated
      with antimalarial resistance, ap2-mu (encoding the mu chain of the adaptor
      protein 2 [AP2] complex), was recently identified in studies on the rodent
      malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi (pcap2-mu). Furthermore, analysis in Kenyan 
      malaria patients of polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum ap2-mu homologue, 
      pfap2-mu, found evidence that differences in the amino acid encoded by codon 160 
      are associated with enhanced parasite survival in vivo following combination
      treatments which included artemisinin derivatives. Here, we characterize the role
      of pfap2-mu in mediating the in vitro antimalarial drug response of P. falciparum
      by generating transgenic parasites constitutively expressing codon 160 encoding
      either the wild-type Ser (Ser160) or the Asn mutant (160Asn) form of pfap2-mu.
      Transgenic parasites carrying the pfap2-mu 160Asn allele were significantly less 
      sensitive to dihydroartemisinin using a standard 48-h in vitro test, providing
      direct evidence of an altered parasite response to artemisinin. Our data also
      provide evidence that pfap2-mu variants can modulate parasite sensitivity to
      quinine. No evidence was found that pfap2-mu variants contribute to the
      slow-clearance phenotype exhibited by P. falciparum in Cambodian patients treated
      with artesunate monotherapy. These findings provide compelling evidence that
      pfap2-mu can modulate P. falciparum responses to multiple drugs. We propose that 
      this gene should be evaluated further as a potential molecular marker of
      antimalarial resistance.

AB  - We aimed to determine the current prevalence of four P. falciparum candidate
      artemisinin resistance biomarkers L263E, E431K, A623E, and S769N in the pfatpase6
      gene in a high transmission area in Tanzania in a retrospective cross sectional
      study using 154 archived samples collected from three previous malaria studies in
      2010, 2011 and 2013. Mutations in pfatpase6 gene were detected in parasite DNA
      isolated from Dried Blood Spots by using PCR-RFLP. We observed overall allelic
      frequencies for L263E, E431K, A623E, and S769N to be 5.8% (9/154), 16.2%
      (25/154), 0.0% (0/154), and 3.9% (6/154). The L263E mutation was not detected in 
      2010 but occurred at 3.9% and 2.6% in 2011 and 2013 respectively. The L263E
      mutation showed a significant change of frequency between 2010 and 2011, but not 
      between 2011 and 2013 (P < 0.05). Frequency of E431K was highest of all without
      any clear trend whereas S769N increased from 2.2% in 2010 to 3.6% in 2011 and
      5.1% in 2013. A623E mutation was not detected. The worrisome detection and the
      increase in the frequency of S769N and other mutations calls for urgent
      assessment of temporal changes of known artemisinin biomarkers in association
      with in vivo ACT efficacy.

AB  - Actin is a highly versatile, abundant, and conserved protein, with functions in a
      variety of intracellular processes. Here, we describe a novel role for insect
      cytoplasmic actin as an extracellular pathogen recognition factor that mediates
      antibacterial defense. Insect actins are secreted from cells upon immune
      challenge through an exosome-independent pathway. Anopheles gambiae actin
      interacts with the extracellular MD2-like immune factor AgMDL1, and binds to the 
      surfaces of bacteria, mediating their phagocytosis and direct killing. Globular
      and filamentous actins display distinct functions as extracellular immune
      factors, and mosquito actin is a Plasmodium infection antagonist.

      number in pre- and post-ACTs in western Kenya.
PG  - 8308
LID - 10.1038/srep08308 [doi]
AB  - Genetic analysis of molecular markers is critical in tracking the emergence
      and/or spread of artemisinin resistant parasites. Clinical isolates collected in 
      western Kenya pre- and post- introduction of artemisinin combination therapies
      (ACTs) were genotyped at SNP positions in regions of strong selection signatures 
      on chromosome 13 and 14, as described in Southeast Asia (SEA). Twenty five SNPs
      were genotyped using Sequenom MassArray and pfmdr1 gene copy number by real-time 
      PCR. Parasite clearance half-life and in vitro drug sensitivity testing were
      performed using standard methods. One hundred twenty nine isolates were
      successfully analyzed. Fifteen SNPs were present in pre-ACTs isolates and six in 
      post-ACTs. None of the SNPs showed association with parasite clearance half-life.
      Post-ACTs parasites had significantly higher pfmdr1 copy number compared to
      pre-ACTs. Seven of eight parasites with multiple pfmdr1 were post-ACTs. When in
      vitro IC50s were compared for parasites with single vs. multiple gene copies,
      only amodiaquine and piperaquine reached statistical significance. Data showed
      SNPs on chromosome 13 and 14 had different frequency and trend in western Kenya
      parasites compared SEA. Increase in pfmdr1 gene copy is consistent with recent
      studies in African parasites. Data suggests genetic signature of artemisinin
      resistance in Africa might be different from SEA.

AB  - The spread of anti-malarial drug resistance will challenge any malaria control
      and elimination strategies, and routine monitoring of resistance-associated
      molecular markers of commonly used anti-malarial drugs is very important.
      Therefore, in the present investigation, the extent of mutations/haplotypes in
      dhfr and dhps genes of Plasmodium falciparum isolates (n=72) was analyzed seven
      years after the introduction of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate
      (AS) as first-line anti-malarial treatment in Iran using PCR-RFLP methods. The
      results showed that the majority of the patients (97.2%) carried both 59R and
      108N mutations in pure form with wild-type genotype at positions N51 and I164.
      Additionally, a significant increase (P<0.05) was observed in the frequency of
      R59N108/G437 haplotype (79.2%) during 2012-2014. This raise was because of the
      significant increase (P<0.05) in the frequency of 437G mutation (81.9%), which
      more likely was due to more availability of SP as anti-malarial drug for
      treatment of falciparum patients in these malaria-endemic areas of Iran. However,
      no quintuple mutations associated with treatment failure were detected. In
      conclusion, the present results along with in vivo assays suggest that seven
      years after the adoption of SP-AS as the first-line treatment in Iran, this drug 
      remains efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, as a
      partner drug with AS in these malaria-endemic areas.

      recognition of multiple antigens.
PG  - 56

AB  - BACKGROUND: Naturally acquired immunity to clinical malaria is thought to be
      mainly antibody-mediated, but reports on antigen targets are contradictory.
      Recognition of multiple antigens may be crucial for protection. In this study,
      the magnitude of antibody responses and their temporal stability was assessed for
      a panel of malaria antigens in relation to protection against clinical Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria. METHODS: Malian children aged two to 14 years were enrolled
      in a longitudinal study and followed up by passive and active case detection for 
      seven months. Plasma was collected at enrolment and at the beginning, in the
      middle and after the end of the transmission season. Antibody titres to the P.
      falciparum-antigens apical membrane protein (AMA)-1, merozoite surface protein
      (MSP)-1(1)(9), MSP-3, glutamine-rich protein (GLURP-R0) and circumsporozoite
      antigen (CSP) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 99
      children with plasma available at all time points. Parasite carriage was
      determined by microscopy and nested PCR. RESULTS: Antibody titres to all
      antigens, except MSP-1(1)(9), and the number of antigens recognized increased
      with age. After malaria exposure, antibody titres increased in children that had 
      low titres at baseline, but decreased in those with high baseline responses. No
      significant differences were found between antibody titers for individual
      antigens between children remaining symptomatic or asymptomatic after exposure,
      after adjustment for age. Instead, children remaining asymptomatic following
      parasite exposure had a broader repertoire of antigen recognition. CONCLUSIONS:
      The present study provides immune-epidemiological evidence from a limited cohort 
      of Malian children that strong recognition of multiple antigens, rather than
      antibody titres for individual antigens, is associated with protection from
      clinical malaria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dried blood spots are a common medium for collecting patient blood
      prior to testing for malaria by molecular methods. A new shaped filter device for
      the quick and simple collection of a designated volume of patient blood has been 
      designed and tested against conventional blood spots for accuracy and precision. 
      METHODS: Shaped filter devices were laser cut from Whatman GB003 paper to absorb 
      a 20 mul blood volume. These devices were used to sample Plasmodium falciparum
      infected blood and the volume absorbed was measured volumetrically. Conventional 
      blood spots were made by pipetting 20 mul of the same blood onto Whatman 3MM
      paper. DNA was extracted from both types of dried blood spot using Qiagen DNA
      blood mini or Chelex extraction for real-time PCR analysis, and PURE extraction
      for malaria LAMP testing. RESULTS: The shaped filter devices collected a mean
      volume of 21.1 mul of blood, with a coefficient of variance of 8.1%. When used
      for DNA extraction by Chelex and Qiagen methodologies the mean number of
      international standard units of P. falciparum DNA recovered per mul of the eluate
      was 53.1 (95% CI: 49.4 to 56.7) and 32.7 (95% CI: 28.8 to 36.6), respectively for
      the shaped filter device, and 54.6 (95% CI: 52.1 to 57.1) and 12.0 (95% CI: 9.9
      to 14.1), respectively for the 3MM blood spots. Qiagen extraction of 200 mul of
      whole infected blood yielded 853.6 international standard units of P. falciparum 
      DNA per mul of eluate. CONCLUSIONS: A shaped filter device provides a simple way 
      to quickly sample and store a defined volume of blood without the need for any
      additional measuring devices. Resultant dried blood spots may be employed for DNA
      extraction using a variety of technologies for nucleic acid amplification without
      the need for repeated cleaning of scissors or punches to prevent cross
      contamination of samples and results are comparable to traditional DBS.

TI  - In vivo monitoring of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine sensitivity in Plasmodium
      falciparum along the China-Myanmar border of Yunnan Province, China from 2007 to 
      2013.
PG  - 47

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the recommended
      first-line treatment of falciparum malaria in all endemic countries. Artemisinin 
      resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has been confirmed in the Greater Mekong
      subregion (GMS). Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DAPQ) is the most commonly used 
      ACT in China. To understand the DAPQ sensitivity of P. falciparum, DAPQ
      resistance was monitored in vivo along the China-Myanmar border from 2007 to
      2013. METHODS: Eligible patients with mono-infections of P. falciparum were
      recruited to this study after obtaining full informed consent. DAPQ tablets for
      different categories of kg body weight ranges were given once a day for three
      days. Patients were followed up for 42 days. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 
      conducted to distinguish between re-infection and recrudescence, to confirm the
      Plasmodium species. The data were entered and analysed by the Kaplan-Meier
      method. Treatment outcome was assessed according to the WHO recommended
      standards. RESULTS: 243 patients were completed valid follow-up. The fever
      clearance time (FCT) and asexual parasite clearance times (APCT) were,
      respectively, 36.5 +/- 10.9 and 43.5 +/- 11.8 hours, and there was an increasing 
      trend of both FCT (F = 268.41, P < 0.0001) and APCT (F = 88.6, P < 0.0001) from
      2007 to 2013. Eight (3.3%, 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.4%) patients present
      parasitaemia on day three after medication; however they were spontaneous cure on
      day four. 241 (99.2%; 95% CI, 97.1-99.9%) of the patients were adequate clinical 
      and parasitological response (ACPR) and the proportions of ACPR had not changed
      significantly from 2007 to 2013 (X(2) = 2.81, P = 0.7288). CONCLUSION: In terms
      of efficacy, DAPQ is still an effective treatment for falciparum malaria. DAPQ
      sensitivity in P. falciparum had not significantly changed along the
      China-Myanmar border of Yunnan Province, China. However more attentions should be
      given to becoming slower fever and parasite clearance.

      multiplex PCR and hydrolysis probes real-time PCR.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0542-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a vector borne-parasitic disease transmitted through the
      bite of the infective female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five Plasmodium species have
      been recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) as the causative agents of
      human malaria. Generally, microscopic examination is the gold standard for
      routine malaria diagnosis. However, molecular PCR assays in many cases have shown
      improvement on the sensitivity and specificity over microscopic or other
      immunochromatographic assays. METHODS: The present study attempts to screen 207
      suspected malaria samples from patients seeking treatment in clinics around Sabah
      state, Malaysia, using two panels of multiplex PCRs, conventional PCR system
      (PlasmoNex) and real-time PCR based on hydrolysis probe technology. Discordance
      results between two PCR assays were further confirmed by sequencing using 18S ssu
      rRNA species-specific primers. RESULTS: Of the 207 malaria samples, Plasmodium
      knowlesi (73.4% vs 72.0%) was the most prevalent species based on two PCR assays,
      followed by Plasmodium falciparum (15.9% vs 17.9%), and Plasmodium vivax (9.7% vs
      7.7%), respectively. Neither Plasmodium malariae nor Plasmodium ovale was
      detected in this study. Nine discrepant species identification based on both the 
      PCR assays were further confirmed through DNA sequencing. Species-specific
      real-time PCR only accurately diagnosed 198 of 207 (95.7%) malaria samples up to 
      species level in contrast to PlasmoNex assay which had 100% sensitivity and
      specificity based on sequencing results. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR accelerate
      the speed in the diagnosis of malaria. The PlasmoNex PCR assay seems to be more
      accurate than real-time PCR in the speciation of all five human malaria
      parasites. The present study also showed a significant increase of the potential 
      fatal P. knowlesi infection in Sabah state as revealed by molecular PCR assays.

AB  - The Plasmodium falciparum cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is a key
      regulator across the malaria parasite life cycle. Little is known about PfPKG's
      activation mechanism. Here we report that the carboxyl cyclic nucleotide binding 
      domain functions as a "gatekeeper" for activation by providing the highest cGMP
      affinity and selectivity. To understand the mechanism, we have solved its crystal
      structures with and without cGMP at 2.0 and 1.9 A, respectively. These structures
      revealed a PfPKG-specific capping triad that forms upon cGMP binding, and
      disrupting the triad reduces kinase activity by 90%. Furthermore, mutating these 
      residues in the parasite prevents blood stage merozoite egress, confirming the
      essential nature of the triad in the parasite. We propose a mechanism of
      activation where cGMP binding allosterically triggers the conformational change
      at the alphaC-helix, which bridges the regulatory and catalytic domains, causing 
      the capping triad to form and stabilize the active conformation.

TI  - Molecular detection of malaria in South punjab with higher proportion of mixed
      infections.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is well known for its fatalities worldwide, Plasmodium vivax 
      and the Plasmodium falciparum are the two important species of malaria reported
      from Pakistan and creating lots of morbidities across the country. METHOD: Study 
      was conducted to determine the Surveillance of malaria in South Punjab by
      microscopy and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULT: samples out of 100
      patients were found positive for malarial parasites. One patient was found with
      mixed infection, whereas P. falciparum and P. vivax infections were detected in
      17 and 22 patients, respectively. In nested PCR, genus-specific primers for
      Plasmodium species. in round 1 and species-specific primers for P. falciparum and
      P. vivax in round 2 were used. By the application of PCR 41% were found to be
      infected by Plasmodium spp. Among Plasmodium positive patients: mixed, P.
      falciparum and P. vivax infection were detected in 10, 15 and 16 patients,
      respectively. Thirty nine microscopically positive patients confirmed to have
      Plasmodium spp. One negative by PCR, 2 microscopically negative patients had
      shown Plasmodium spp. infection (P. falciparum and P. vivax) by PCR. In total
      samples, P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infection accounted for 36.6%, 39.0%
      and 24.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Microscopy was found deficient for
      interpretation of mixed infections, low parasitaemia, and species specific
      diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity and efficacy of nested PCR was calculated
      95%, 98% and 97%, respectively, showing PCR as a more effective and efficient
      diagnostic tool for malaria.

TI  - Time-to-infection by Plasmodium falciparum is largely determined by random
      factors.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s12916-014-0252-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of protective immune responses to P. falciparum
      infection is an important goal for the development of a vaccine for malaria. This
      requires the identification of susceptible and resistant individuals, so that
      their immune responses may be studied. Time-to-infection studies are one method
      for identifying putative susceptible individuals (infected early) versus
      resistant individuals (infected late). However, the timing of infection is
      dependent on random factors, such as whether the subject was bitten by an
      infected mosquito, as well as individual factors, such as their level of
      immunity. It is important to understand how much of the observed variation in
      infection is simply due to chance. METHODS: We analyse previously published data 
      from a treatment-time-to-infection study of 201 individuals aged 0.5 to 78 years 
      living in Western Kenya. We use a mathematical modelling approach to investigate 
      the role of immunity versus random factors in determining time-to-infection in
      this cohort. We extend this analysis using a modelling approach to understand
      what factors might increase or decrease the utility of these studies for
      identifying susceptible and resistant individuals. RESULTS: We find that, under
      most circumstances, the observed distribution of time-to-infection is consistent 
      with this simply being a random process. We find that age, method for detection
      of infection (PCR versus microscopy), and underlying force of infection are all
      factors in determining whether time-to-infection is a useful correlate of
      immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Many epidemiological studies of P. falciparum infection
      assume that the observed variation in infection outcomes, such as
      time-to-infection or presence or absence of infection, is determined by host
      resistance or susceptibility. However, under most circumstances, this
      distribution appears largely due to the random timing of infection, particularly 
      in children. More direct measurements, such as parasite growth rate, may be more 
      useful than time-to-infection in segregating patients based on their level of
      immunity.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria is highly endemic in the three most affected
      countries in the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa. As
      EVD and malaria are clinically indistinguishable, both remain part of the
      differential diagnosis of ill travelers from returning from areas of EVD
      transmission. We compared the performances of a rapid diagnostic test (BinaxNOW) 
      and real-time PCR with P. falciparum-positive specimens before and after heat and
      Triton X-100 inactivation, and we documented no loss of sensitivity.

TI  - What is the burden of submicroscopic malaria in pregnancy in central India?
PG  - 30-8
LID - 10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional microscopy underestimates the burden of malarial
      infection when compared with molecular diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based methods. Lower density parasitemias serve as a reservoir for
      infection. We evaluated the prevalence of submicroscopic infections in an area of
      unstable malarial transmission in India and determined whether these infections
      negatively impacted maternal or fetal outcomes. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study (2007-2008) was undertaken in two districts of Chhattisgarh, recruiting
      women from both antenatal clinics (ANCs) and delivery units (DUs). For ANC/DU
      subjects, peripheral/placental blood, respectively, was obtained for conventional
      microscopy and collected onto filter paper for PCR analysis. RESULTS: There were 
      3425 pregnant women, including 2477 ANC subjects and 948 DU subjects who had both
      microscopic and PCR samples available. Polymerase chain reaction detected
      significantly more Plasmodium infections than traditional light microscopy both
      from peripheral (3.4 vs 1.2%; OR 2.9, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.9-4.5) and
      placental (4.2 vs 1.7%; OR 2.5, 95% CIs 1.4-4.8) blood samples. Submicroscopic
      infections were not associated with anemia or severe maternal anemia among ANC or
      DU participants and were not associated with low birth weight (LBW) among DU
      participants. In contrast, microscopically detected infections were associated
      with severe anemia and LBW. CONCLUSIONS: In this area of unstable malarial
      transmission from India, submicroscopic infections did not identify a set of
      pregnant women at increased risk for anemia or LBW. Until PCR techniques become
      much less expensive and available as a point of care test for the field setting, 
      its use will be limited for malarial detection.

TI  - Increased sample volume and use of quantitative reverse-transcription PCR can
      improve prediction of liver-to-blood inoculum size in controlled human malaria
      infection studies.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0541-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies increasingly rely
      on nucleic acid test (NAT) methods to detect and quantify parasites in the blood 
      of infected participants. The lower limits of detection and quantification vary
      amongst the assays used throughout the world, which may affect the ability of
      mathematical models to accurately estimate the liver-to-blood inoculum (LBI)
      values that are used to judge the efficacy of pre-erythrocytic vaccine and drug
      candidates. METHODS: Samples were collected around the time of onset of
      pre-patent parasitaemia from subjects who enrolled in two different CHMI clinical
      trials. Blood samples were tested for Plasmodium falciparum 18S rRNA and/or rDNA 
      targets by different NAT methods and results were compared. Methods included an
      ultrasensitive, large volume modification of an established quantitative reverse 
      transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that achieves detection of as little as one
      parasite/mL of whole blood. RESULTS: Large volume qRT-PCR at the University of
      Washington was the most sensitive test and generated quantifiable data more often
      than any other NAT methodology. Standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed at the
      University of Oxford and standard volume qRT-PCR performed at the University of
      Washington were less sensitive than the large volume qRT-PCR, especially at 6.5
      days after CHMI. In these trials, the proportion of participants for whom LBI
      could be accurately quantified using parasite density value greater than or equal
      to the lower limit of quantification was increased. A greater improvement would
      be expected in trials in which numerous subjects receive a lower LBI or low dose 
      challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Standard qPCR and qRT-PCR methods with analytical
      sensitivities of ~20 parasites/mL probably suffice for most CHMI purposes, but
      the newly developed large volume qRT-PCR may be able to answer specific questions
      when more analytical sensitivity is required.

TI  - Randomized non-inferiority and safety trial of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine and
      artesunate-amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine are first-line
      treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Cameroon. No study has yet compared the
      efficacy of these drugs following the WHO recommended 42-day follow-up period.
      The goal of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy, tolerability and
      safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and
      dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DHAP) among children aged less than ten years in 
      two malaria-endemic ecological regions of Cameroon. METHODS: A three-arm,
      randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted among children of
      either gender aged six months (>5 kg) to ten years (n = 720) with acute
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection. Parents/guardians of children
      provided consent prior to randomization to receive ASAQ, DHAP or AL in the ratio 
      of 2:2:1, respectively. Treatment outcome was assessed based on standard WHO 2003
      classification after 42 days of follow-up. The primary outcome was PCR-corrected 
      day-42 cure rates. The non-inferiority, one-sided, lower limit asymptotic 97.5%
      confidence interval (CI) on the difference in PCR-corrected cure rates of ASAQ
      and DHAP when compared to AL was accepted if the lower limit of the CI was
      greater than -10%. Secondary outcomes were parasite and fever clearances and day 
      7 haemoglobin changes. RESULTS: PCR-corrected PP cure rates of 96.7, 98.1 and
      96.3, respectively, for AL, ASAQ and DHAP was observed. The lower bound of the
      one-sided 97.5% CI calculated around the difference between day-42 cure rate
      point estimates in AL and ASAQ groups, AL and DHAP groups were, -6% and -4%
      respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in parasite or
      fever clearance times between treatments, although fever clearance pattern was
      different between ASAQ and DHAP. No statistical significant differences were
      observed in the occurrence of adverse events among treatment groups. CONCLUSION: 
      ASAQ and DHAP are considered safe and tolerable and are not inferior to AL in the
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: NCT01845701.
