AB  - Malaria is one of the serious diseases threatening human health in Pakistan and
      contributes to a large proportion of the total malaria deaths in South Asia.
      However, little is known about the nature and extent of genetic diversity of the 
      malarial parasites circulating in Pakistan. This study was designed to assess the
      infection status of Plasmodium and the genetic diversity of Plasmodium vivax and 
      Plasmodium falciparum by analyzing msp-3alpha, msp-3beta and msp-1, msp-2 genes
      respectively using allele specific nested PCR and RFLP assays. For this purpose, 
      130 field isolates were collected from the individuals who exhibited clinical
      symptoms associated with malaria in the Kohat region of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa
      (KPK), Pakistan. Among 130 blood samples collected, P. vivax was detected in
      105/130 (80.8%) and P. falciparum in 21/130 (16.2%). Mixed infections with both
      parasites were detected in 4/130 (3%) of the isolates. A large number of
      distinguishable alleles were found for msp genetic markers: 10 alleles for
      msp-3alpha and seven for msp-3beta with one mixed infection in case of msp-3beta.
      The genotyping of P. falciparum showed that K1+MAD20 mixed genotype was dominant 
      in msp-1 and FC27 in msp-2. The results collectively suggest that P. vivax and P.
      falciparum populations in this region are highly polymorphic and mixed infections
      are prevalent.

TI  - Mosquito bisection as a variable in estimates of PCR-derived malaria sporozoite
      rates.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods offer an
      alternative to the light microscopy examination of mosquito salivary glands for
      the determination of malaria sporozoite rates in wild caught female Anopheles.
      Removal of mosquito abdomens is assumed to eliminate false positives caused by
      malaria oocyst DNA in the midgut. This assumption has not been tested with
      current gold standard PCR assays, and for the variety of conditions that
      specimens could encounter in the laboratory and field. METHODS: Laboratory
      Anopheles stephensi were used that had been infected with Plasmodium falciparum
      6-7 days and 14 days post infection (p.i.), when oocysts only and oocysts +
      sporozoites, respectively, are developed. Mosquitoes were killed and immediately 
      frozen, air dried before being frozen, or stored under humid conditions overnight
      before being frozen, to simulate a range of conditions in the field.
      Additionally, abdomens were removed anterior to, at, or posterior to the junction
      of the abdomen and thorax, and both portions were processed using a standard
      nested PCR of the small sub-unit nuclear ribosomal genes (ssrDNA) with products
      visualized on agarose gels. RESULTS: Overall, 4.1 % (4/97) of head + thorax
      samples that were 6-7 days p.i. gave apparent false positives for sporozoites,
      compared to 9.3 % (9/97) that were positive for abdomens. No positives (0/52)
      were obtained when similar specimens were bisected anterior to the junction of
      the thorax and abdomen, compared to 21.2 % (11/52) that were positive for
      posterior portions. Multiple bands were noted for positives from the 'Frozen'
      treatment and the rate of false negatives due to DNA degradation appears higher
      under the 'Humid' treatment. Reproducibility of results for the 'Frozen'
      treatment was 90 %. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance of specimen condition and
      the bisection step in determining sporozoite rates, little attention has been
      paid to them in the literature. Recommendations from this study are that: 1) care
      needs to be taken to reduce DNA degradation in the field; 2) mosquito abdomens be
      separated anterior to the junction of the thorax and abdomen; and 3) DNA
      sequencing of a subsample of positive results should be undertaken if possible.

TI  - Evaluating the frequency of bacterial co-infections in children recruited into a 
      malaria pathogenesis study in The Gambia, West Africa using molecular methods.
PG  - 151-8
LID - 10.1016/j.mcp.2012.04.003 [doi]
AB  - Systemic bacteraemia has been reported in children with severe Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in Sub Saharan Africa, making the identification or exclusion 
      of concurrent infections a prerequisite for adequate treatment and studies of the
      immune responses to particular infections. Given the overlap in clinical signs in
      humans between malaria and, for example, pneumonia, the true cause of severe
      illness is sometimes difficult to establish. Traditional microbiological culture 
      methods employed to detect systemic bacteraemia are often time consuming and have
      modest sensitivity. Therefore, molecular methods have become increasingly used in
      the diagnosis of septicaemia. Here, we evaluated the usefulness of both
      broad-range 16S rRNA PCR, in conjunction with DNA sequencing and species-specific
      PCR targeting of Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella, to screen
      for bacterial co-infections in blood samples from children enrolled in a malaria 
      pathogenesis study. PCR revealed no test-positive results for these pathogens and
      DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons identified the presence of bacterial genomic
      DNA (most probably from environmental bacterial sources) in a large proportion of
      samples. We demonstrate that the issue of potential mixed bacteraemic infection
      and/or background bacterial genomic DNA, which may relate to co-migration of PCR 
      amplicons on agarose gels, can be overcome by using denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE). PCR for Plasmodium spp. was also performed on genomic DNA
      from bloods from Gambian children with pneumonia, in order to estimate the
      prevalence of Plasmodium/pneumonia co-infections in the study population. While
      12.2% of samples were test-positive, parasite density was very low and did not
      vary significantly between cases and controls.

TI  - Differential Plasmodium falciparum infection of Anopheles gambiae s.s. molecular 
      and chromosomal forms in Mali.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) is a primary vector of
      Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some physiological
      differences among molecular and chromosomal forms of this species have been
      demonstrated, the relative susceptibility to malaria parasite infection among
      them has not been unequivocally shown. The objective of this study was to
      investigate P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein infection (CSP) positivity
      among An. gambiae s.s. chromosomal and molecular forms. METHODS: Wild An. gambiae
      from two sites Kela (n=464) and Sidarebougou (n=266) in Mali were screened for
      the presence of P. falciparum CSP using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). Samples were then identified to molecular form using multiple PCR
      diagnostics (n=713) and chromosomal form using chromosomal karyotyping (n=419).
      RESULTS: Of 730 An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) mosquitoes, 89 (12.2%) were CSP
      ELISA positive. The percentage of positive mosquitoes varied by site: 52 (11.2%) 
      in Kela and 37 (13.9%) in Sidarebougou. Eighty-seven of the positive mosquitoes
      were identified to molecular form and they consisted of nine Anopheles arabiensis
      (21.4%), 46 S (10.9%), 31 M (12.8%), and one MS hybrid (14.3%). Sixty of the
      positive mosquitoes were identified to chromosomal form and they consisted of
      five An. arabiensis (20.0%), 21 Savanna (15.1%), 21 Mopti (30.4%), 11 Bamako
      (9.2%), and two hybrids (20.0%). DISCUSSION: In this collection, the prevalence
      of P. falciparum infection in the M form was equivalent to infection in the S
      form (no molecular form differential infection). There was a significant
      differential infection by chromosomal form such that, P. falciparum infection was
      more prevalent in the Mopti chromosomal forms than in the Bamako or Savanna
      forms; the Mopti form was also the most underrepresented in the collection.
      Continued research on the differential P. falciparum infection of An. gambiae
      s.s. chromosomal and molecular forms may suggest that Plasmodium - An. gambiae
      interactions play a role in malaria transmission.

TI  - Temporal trends of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) drug-resistance molecular
      markers in Plasmodium falciparum parasites from pregnant women in western Kenya.
PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites is associated with mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase 
      (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes and has spread worldwide. SP
      remains the recommended drug for intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in
      pregnancy (IPTp) and information on population prevalence of the SP resistance
      molecular markers in pregnant women is limited. METHODS: Temporal trends of SP
      resistance molecular markers were investigated in 489 parasite samples collected 
      from pregnant women at delivery from three different observational studies
      between 1996 and 2009 in Kenya, where SP was adopted for both IPTp and case
      treatment policies in 1998. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction,
      pyrosequencing and direct sequencing, 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      of SP resistance molecular markers were assayed. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      quintuple mutant (dhfr N51I/C59R/S108N and dhps A437G/K540E combined genotype)
      increased from 7% in the first study (1996-2000) to 88% in the third study
      (2008-2009). When further stratified by sample collection year and adoption of
      IPTp policy, the prevalence of the quintuple mutant increased from 2.4% in 1998
      to 44.4% three years after IPTp policy adoption, seemingly in parallel with the
      increase in percentage of SP use in pregnancy. However, in the 1996-2000 study,
      more mutations in the combined dhfr/dhps genotype were associated with SP use
      during pregnancy only in univariable analysis and no associations were detected
      in the 2002-2008 and 2008-2009 studies. In addition, in the 2008-2009 study, 5.3%
      of the parasite samples carried the dhps triple mutant (A437G/K540E/A581G). There
      were no differences in the prevalence of SP mutant genotypes between the parasite
      samples from HIV + and HIV- women over time and between paired peripheral and
      placental samples. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in dhfr/dhps
      quintuple mutant and the emergence of new genotype containing dhps 581 in the
      parasites from pregnant women in western Kenya over 13 years. IPTp adoption and
      SP use in pregnancy only played a minor role in the increased drug-resistant
      parasites in the pregnant women over time. Most likely, other major factors, such
      as the high prevalence of resistant parasites selected by the use of SP for case 
      management in large non-pregnant population, might have contributed to the
      temporally increased prevalence of SP resistant parasites in pregnant women.
      Further investigations are needed to determine the linkage between SP drug
      resistance markers and efficacy of IPTp-SP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Control of malaria during pregnancy remains a major public health

      frequency of submicroscopic and multiple Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum)
      infections during pregnancy, using the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein1
      (MSP-1) gene as a polymorphic marker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a
      cross-sectional, analytical study that was conducted at Omdurman Maternity
      Hospital, Sudan, between July 2003 and December 2004. Following informed consent,
      836 pregnant women between the ages of 16-47 years with different gestational
      ages were enrolled in the study. Thin and thick blood films were stained with
      Giemsa and examined by experienced microscopists. Parasite DNA was extracted
      using Chelex method. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for
      P. falciparum were carried out to detect infections below the threshold of
      microscopy and to genotype different strains in the samples using merozoite
      surface protein-1. RESULTS: More than a quarter of the study participants
      (219/836; 26.2%) were smear-positive for malaria infection. The results of the
      PCR-based assays showed that 41.8 % (257/617) of the smear-negative women were
      PCR positive and therefore had submicroscopic infections. The mean number of
      genetically different P. falciparum parasites detected was 2.7 (range 1-9). The
      multiplicity of infection identified by at least two alleles of MSP-1 was
      significantly higher among paucigravidae (45.6%) compared to multigravidae
      (28.9%), with mean number of alleles of 2.4 and 1.9, respectively (p=0.009). This
      likely indicates the gradual acquisition of immunity. CONCLUSION: Conventional
      microscopy underestimates the actual extent of malaria infections during
      pregnancy in endemic regions. Multiplicity of infection may be an important
      factor in the gradual acquisition of strain-specific immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although transmission of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection during 
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusion from an infected donor has been well documented,
      malaria parasites are not known to infect hematopoietic stem cells. We report a
      case of Pf infection in a patient 11 days after peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant for sickle cell disease. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Malaria parasites
      were detected in thick blood smears by Giemsa staining. Pf HRP2 antigen was
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on whole blood and plasma. Pf DNA
      was detected in whole blood and stem cell retention samples by real-time
      polymerase chain reaction using Pf species-specific primers and probes.
      Genotyping of eight Pf microsatellites was performed on genomic DNA extracted
      from whole blood. RESULTS: Pf was not detected by molecular, serologic, or
      parasitologic means in samples from the recipient until Day 11 posttransplant,
      coincident with the onset of symptoms. In contrast, Pf antigen was
      retrospectively detected in stored plasma collected 3 months before transplant
      from the asymptomatic donor. Pf DNA was detected in whole blood from both the
      donor and the recipient after transplant, and genotyping confirmed shared markers
      between donor and recipient Pf strains. Lookback analysis of RBC donors was
      negative for Pf infection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with
      transmission by the stem cell product and have profound implications with respect
      to the screening of potential stem cell donors and recipients from
      malaria-endemic regions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to validate the use of pftetQ and pfmdt genes as 
      molecular markers of decreased in vitro susceptibility to doxycycline in 113
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Dakar, Senegal. The results show that copy
      numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt, estimated by TaqMan real-time PCR, are not
      significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to doxycycline in vitro;
      however, the number of samples with a high doxycycline IC(50) was likely to be
      too low to derive statistically significant results. Thus, no definitive
      conclusions could be drawn. The markers should be further tested by analysing
      more isolates.

TI  - Evidence for in vitro and in vivo expression of the conserved VAR3 (type 3)
      plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Members of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
      (PfEMP1) adhesion antigen family are major contributors to the pathogenesis of P.
      falciparum malaria infections. The PfEMP1-encoding var genes are among the most
      diverse sequences in nature, but three genes, var1, var2csa and var3 are found
      conserved in most parasite genomes. The most severe forms of malaria disease are 
      caused by parasites expressing a subset of antigenically conserved PfEMP1
      variants. Thus the ubiquitous and conserved VAR3 PfEMP1 is of particular interest
      to the research field. Evidence of VAR3 expression on the infected erythrocyte
      surface has never been presented, and var3 genes have been proposed to be
      transcribed and expressed differently from the rest of the var gene family
      members. METHODS: In this study, parasites expressing VAR3 PfEMP1 were generated 
      using anti-VAR3 antibodies and the var transcript and PfEMP1 expression profiles 
      of the generated parasites were investigated. The IgG reactivity by plasma from
      children living in malaria-endemic Tanzania was tested to parasites and
      recombinant VAR3 protein. Parasites from hospitalized children were isolated and 
      the transcript level of var3 was investigated. RESULTS: Var3 is transcribed and
      its protein product expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. The
      VAR3-expressing parasites were better recognized by children s IgG than a
      parasite line expressing a Group B var gene. Two in 130 children showed increased
      recognition of parasites expressing VAR3 and to the recombinant VAR3 protein
      after a malaria episode and the isolated parasites showed high levels of var3
      transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the presented data suggest that var3 is
      transcribed and its protein product expressed on the surface of infected
      erythrocytes in the same manner as seen for other var genes both in vitro and in 
      vivo. Only very few children exhibit seroconversion to VAR3 following a malaria
      episode requiring hospitalization, supporting the previous conclusion drawn from 
      var3 transcript analysis of parasites collected from children hospitalized with
      malaria, that VAR3 is not associated with severe anaemia or cerebral malaria
      syndromes in children.

      severe malaria.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exports proteins that remodel the erythrocyte
      membrane. One such protein, called Pf155/RESA (RESA1) contributes to parasite
      fitness, optimizing parasite survival during febrile episodes. Resa1 gene is a
      member of a small family comprising three highly related genes. Preliminary
      evidence led to a search for clues indicating the involvement of RESA2 protein in
      the pathophysiology of malaria. In the present study, cDNA sequence of resa2 gene
      was obtained from two different strains. The proportion of P. falciparum isolates
      having a non-stop T1526C mutation in resa2 gene was evaluated and the association
      of this genotype with severity of malaria was investigated. METHODS: Resa2 cDNAs 
      of two different strains (a patient isolate and K1 culture adapted strain) was
      obtained by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing was performed to confirm its gene
      structure. The proportion of isolates having a T1526C mutation was evaluated
      using a PCR-RFLP methodology on groups of severe malaria and uncomplicated
      patients recruited in 1991-1994 in Senegal and in 2009 in Benin. RESULTS: A
      unique ORF with an internal translation stop was found in the patient isolate
      (Genbank access number : JN183870), while the K1 strain harboured the T1526C
      mutation (Genbank access number : JN183869) which affects the internal stop codon
      and restores a full length coding sequence. About 14% of isolates obtained from
      Senegal and Benin harboured mutant T1526C parasites. Some isolates had both wild 
      and mutant resa alleles. The analysis excluding those mixed isolates showed that 
      the resa2 T1526C mutation was found more frequently in severe malaria cases than 
      in uncomplicated cases (p = 0.008). The association of the presence of the mutant
      allele and parasitaemia >4% was shown in multivariate analysis (p = 0.03) in the 
      group of Beninese children. CONCLUSIONS: All T1526C mutant parasites
      theoretically have the ability to give rise to a full-length RESA2 protein. This 
      study raises the hypothesis that the RESA2 protein could favour high-density
      infections. Other studies in various geographic settings and probably including
      more patients are now required to replicate these results and to answer the
      questions raised by these results.

TI  - Survey for asymptomatic malaria cases in low transmission settings of Iran under 
      elimination programme.
PG  - 126
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, continuous exposure to Plasmodium parasites
      leads to asymptomatic carriers that provide a fundamental reservoir of parasites,
      contributing to the persistence of malaria transmission. Therefore, in the
      present investigation, the presence and prevalence of malaria asymptomatic cases 
      were determined to evaluate the reservoir of infection in two malaria endemic
      areas with a previous history of malaria transmission in the south of Iran,
      Bashagard and Ghale-Ganj districts of Hormozgan and Kerman provinces,
      respectively, where malaria transmission has been drastically reduced in the
      recent years. METHODS: The population samples (n = 500 from each of the studied
      areas) were randomly collected from non-febrile, long-term residing, aged two to 
      over 60 years, during 20092010. Three identical surveys were carried out in both 
      study areas and in each phase all the consent participants were interviewed and
      clinically examined. In all, three surveys to detect hidden parasite reservoirs
      (both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax), thick and thin blood smears
      and a highly sensitive nested-PCR were applied. In addition, the sero-prevalence 
      survey for detecting malaria exposure was done by using a serological marker.
      RESULTS: In this study, P. vivax and P. falciparum parasites were not detected by
      light microscopy and nested-PCR assay in all three surveys of samples. Antibody
      responses against P. vivax and P. falciparum were detected in 1% and 0.2% of the 
      total examined individuals, respectively, in Bashagard district. Regarding to
      Ghale-Ganj district, about 0.9% of the individuals had IgG -specific antibody to 
      P. vivax at the first and second surveys, but at the third survey 0.45% of the
      participants had positive antibody to P. vivax parasite. IgG -specific antibody
      to P. falciparum was detected in 0.2% of the participants at the first and
      follow-up surveys. The overall regional differences were not statistically
      significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Taken together, the lack of asymptomatic
      carrier with the evidence of extremely low sero-positive to both P. vivax and P. 
      falciparum among examined individuals supported the limited recent transmission
      in the studied areas and, therefore, these parts of Iran have potential to
      eliminate the disease in the next few years. However, continued follow up and
      action are still needed in both studied areas and also in their neighbouring
      province, Sistan and Baluchistan, which has the highest reported cases of malaria
      in Iran and also, has the largest border line with Afghanistan and Pakistan, with
      no elimination activities. This data will provide useful information for managing
      elimination activities in Iran.

TI  - Distribution of human CYP2C8*2 allele in three different African populations.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate cytochrome P450 2C8*2
      (CYP2C8*2) distribution and allele frequency in three populations from West and
      East Africa exposed to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. CYP2C8 enzyme is involved
      in the metabolism of the anti-malarials amodiaquine and chloroquine. The presence
      of the CYP2C8*2 defective allele has been recently associated to higher rate of
      chloroquine-resistant malaria parasites. METHODS: A total of 503 young subjects
      were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs11572103 (A/T).
      Eighty-eight were from southern Senegal, 262 from eastern Uganda and 153 from
      southern Madagascar. The PCR-RFLP technique was used to discriminate the
      wild-type (A) from the defective allele (T). RESULTS: A CYP2C8*2 (T) allele
      frequency of 0.222 +/- 0.044 was detected in Senegal, 0.105 +/- 0.019 in Uganda
      and 0.150 +/- 0.029 in Madagascar. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that
      CYP2C8*2 allele is widespread in Africa. This allele occurs at different
      frequency in West and East Africa, being higher in Senegal than in Uganda and
      Madagascar. These data indicate that an important fraction of the populations
      analysed has a decreased enzymatic activity, thus being at higher risk for drug
      accumulation with two possible consequences: i) an exacerbation of
      drug-associated adverse side effects; ii) an increase of drug-resistance
      selection pressure on P. falciparum parasites.

TI  - Dihydroartemisinin/Piperaquine: a review of its use in the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 937-61

AB  - Artemisinin-based combination regimens are recommended by WHO for the treatment
      of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. One such combination comprises
      the artemisinin derivative dihydroartemisinin and the bisquinolone piperaquine.
      Eurartesim(R) is the only dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine formulation that meets
      international good manufacturing practice standards. This article reviews the
      pharmacological properties of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, and the
      therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine in the
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. A number of trials have shown
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine to be highly effective in the treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Two pivotal, randomized, open-label,
      multicentre trials demonstrated the Eurartesim(R) formulation of
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine to be noninferior to artesunate plus mefloquine in
      children and adults in Asia and noninferior to artemether/lumefantrine in
      children in Africa, in terms of polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates.
      In both trials, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine recipients were significantly less
      likely than artesunate plus mefloquine recipients or artemether/lumefantrine
      recipients to experience reinfection. Gametocyte carriage was greater in patients
      receiving dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine than in those receiving comparator
      antimalarial regimens. The Eurartesim(R) formulation of
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine was generally well tolerated in the treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and was associated with significantly less
      nausea, vomiting and dizziness than artesunate plus mefloquine. Although
      prolongation of the corrected QT interval has been reported in patients receiving
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine, there are currently no clinical data signalling
      that it is associated with clinically significant arrhythmias. In conclusion,
      dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine is a valuable option for use in the first-line
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

TI  - Comparison of molecular tests for the diagnosis of malaria in Honduras.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Honduras is a tropical country with more than 70% of its population
      living at risk of being infected with either Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium
      falciparum. Laboratory diagnosis is a very important factor for adequate
      treatment and management of malaria. In Honduras, malaria is diagnosed by both,
      microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests and to date, no molecular methods have been
      implemented for routine diagnosis. However, since mixed infections, and
      asymptomatic and low-parasitaemic cases are difficult to detect by light
      microscopy alone, identifying appropriate molecular tools for diagnostic
      applications in Honduras deserves further study. The present study investigated
      the utility of different molecular tests for the diagnosis of malaria in
      Honduras. METHODS: A total of 138 blood samples collected as part of a clinical
      trial to assess the efficacy of chloroquine were used: 69 microscopically
      confirmed P. falciparum positive samples obtained on the day of enrollment and 69
      follow-up samples obtained 28 days after chloroquine treatment and shown to be
      malaria negative by microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was
      compared to an 18 s ribosomal RNA gene-based nested PCR, two single-PCR reactions
      designed to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections, one single-PCR to detect
      Plasmodium vivax infections, and one multiplex one-step PCR reaction to detect
      both parasite species. RESULTS: Of the 69 microscopically positive P. falciparum 
      samples, 68 were confirmed to be P. falciparum-positive by two of the molecular
      tests used. The one sample not detected as P. falciparum by any of the molecular 
      tests was shown to be P. vivax-positive by a reference molecular test indicating 
      a misdiagnosis by microscopy. The reference molecular test detected five cases of
      P. vivax/P. falciparum mixed infections, which were not recognized by microscopy 
      as mixed infections. Only two of these mixed infections were recognized by a
      multiplex test while a P. vivax-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected
      three of them. In addition, one of the day 28 samples, previously determined to
      be malaria negative by microscopy, was shown to be P. vivax-positive by three of 
      the molecular tests specific for this parasite. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tests are 
      valuable tools for the confirmation of Plasmodium species and in detecting mixed 
      infections in malaria endemic regions.

TI  - Curcumin enhances non-opsonic phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum through
      up-regulation of CD36 surface expression on monocytes/macrophages.
PG  - 1895-904
LID - 10.1093/jac/dks132 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Curcumin is a natural plant product with antimalarial activity and
      immunomodulatory properties. In this study we aimed to investigate its effects on
      CD36 expression and CD36-mediated Plasmodium falciparum phagocytosis as well as
      the role played by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma retinoid X receptor (PPARgamma-RXR) in
      these processes. METHODS: In vitro antimalarial activity was evaluated by the
      [(3)H]hypoxanthine assay. ROS production and surface CD36 in human
      monocyte/macrophages were measured by flow cytometry. PPARgamma and CD36 mRNA
      expression was determined by the QuantiGene Plex(R) assay and RT-qPCR. Nuclear
      PPARgamma activation was analysed by a DNA-binding ELISA while nuclear
      erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression was analysed by western blotting. P.
      falciparum phagocytosis was assessed by light microscopy. RESULTS: Curcumin's
      antimalarial activity was confirmed and did not differ between drug-susceptible
      and -resistant P. falciparum strains. Curcumin increased monocyte ROS production 
      and expression of PPARgamma and CD36 at the mRNA and protein levels. Although
      PPARgamma activation was blocked by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662, CD36
      expression and CD36-mediated P. falciparum phagocytosis were only inhibited by
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suggesting a PPARgamma-independent CD36 expression
      pathway. We then identified seven putative Nrf2 antioxidant response elements on 
      the CD36 gene promoter and showed that NAC inhibited curcumin-induced Nrf2
      protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: CD36 expression and CD36-mediated P. falciparum 
      phagocytosis by curcumin are dependent on ROS production and probably involve the
      Nrf2 pathway. The dual immunomodulatory and antimalarial mechanisms of curcumin
      action may mean that curcumin has potential as an adjuvant treatment limiting the
      risk of recrudescence following standard antimalarial therapy.

TI  - Molecular monitoring of Plasmodium falciparum drug susceptibility at the time of 
      the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy in Yaounde, Cameroon:
      implications for the future.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular monitoring of the levels of anti-malarial resistance of
      Plasmodium falciparum is an essential policy to adapt therapy and improve malaria
      control. This monitoring can be facilitated by using molecular tools, which are
      easier to implement than the classical determination of the resistance phenotype.
      In Cameroon, chloroquine (CQ), previously the first-line therapy for
      uncomplicated malaria was officially withdrawn in 2002 and replaced initially by 
      amodiaquine (AQ) monotherapy. Then, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), 
      notably artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL), was
      gradually introduced in 2004. This situation raised the question of the evolution
      of P. falciparum resistance molecular markers in Yaounde, a highly urbanized
      Cameroonian city. METHODS: The genotype of pfcrt 72 and 76 and pfmdr1 86 alleles 
      and pfmdr1 copy number were determined using real-time PCR in 447 P. falciparum
      samples collected between 2005 and 2009. RESULTS: This study showed a high
      prevalence of parasites with mutant pfcrt 76 (83%) and pfmdr1 86 (93%) codons. On
      the contrary, no mutations in the pfcrt 72 codon and no samples with duplication 
      of the pfmdr1 gene were observed. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of mutant pfcrt
      76T and pfmdr1 86Y alleles might be due to the choice of alternative drugs (AQ
      and AS-AQ) known to select such genotypes. Mutant pfcrt 72 codon was not detected
      despite the prolonged use of AQ either as monotherapy or combined with
      artesunate. The absence of pfmdr1 multicopies suggests that AL would still remain
      efficient. The limited use of mefloquine or the predominance of mutant pfmdr1 86Y
      codon could explain the lack of pfmdr1 amplification. Indeed, this mutant codon
      is rarely associated with duplication of pfmdr1 gene. In Cameroon, the changes of
      therapeutic strategies and the simultaneous use of several formulations of ACT or
      other anti-malarials that are not officially recommended result in a complex
      selective pressure, rendering the prediction of the evolution of P. falciparum
      resistance difficult. This public health problem should lead to increased
      vigilance and regular monitoring.

TI  - Artemether-lumefantrine: an option for malaria.
PG  - 567-77
LID - 10.1345/aph.1Q539 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
      artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. DATA 
      SOURCES: English-language articles indexed in PubMed (1947-November 2011) were
      identified, using the search terms artemether-lumefantrine,
      artemether-lumefantrine AND malaria, Coartem, and Coartem AND malaria. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English-language articles were reviewed.
      In addition, the malaria treatment regimens recommended by region as provided by 
      the World Health Organization and the treatment guidelines from the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Artemether-lumefantrine is an artemisinin-derived combination antimalarial
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2009 for the treatment of P.
      falciparum malaria. The dual mechanisms of action of artemether-lumefantrine
      provide rapid and sustained parasite clearance. In the reviewed studies, the
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected 28-day cure rates of
      artemether-lumefantrine were noninferior to the most common comparators,
      including chloroquine, dapsone, and other artemisinin derivatives (86-100% vs
      51-100%, respectively). PCR-corrected day-42 cure rates were 92-99.3% for
      artemether-lumefantrine versus 62-100% for the comparator groups. The major
      adverse effects (gastrointestinal and central nervous system) were mild to
      moderate in severity and did not require a change in therapy. Although adherence 
      to artemether-lumefantrine has been described as a potential problem due to the
      complicated dosing schedule, studies have described clinical cure rates similar
      to those of other antimalarials. CONCLUSIONS: Artemether-lumefantrine is a safe
      and effective treatment for children and adults with P. falciparum malaria.

TI  - Plasmodium knowlesi: from Malaysia, a novel health care threat.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - Epidemic foci of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria have been identified during the past
      ten years in Malaysia, in particular in the States of Sarawak and Sabah (Malaysia
      Borneo), and in the Pahang region (peninsular Malaysia). Based on a review of the
      available recent international literature, the authors underline the importance
      of molecular biology examinations, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), performed
      with primers specific for P. knowlesi, since the current microscopic examination 
      (haemoscope) may fail to distinguish P. knowlesi from Plasmodium malariae, due to
      the very similar appearance of the two parasites. P. knowlesi has been described 
      as the causal agent of life-threatening and lethal forms of malaria: its clinical
      picture is more severe when compared with that of P. malariae, since the disease 
      is characterized by greater parasitaemia, as opposed to that documented in the
      course of P. malariae disease. The most effective carrier is Anopheles
      leucosphyrus: this mosquito is attracted by both humans and monkeys. Among
      primates, the natural hosts of P. knowlesi are Macaca fascicularis and Macaca
      nemestina, while Saimiri scirea and Macaca mulatta, which cannot become infected 
      in nature, may be useful in experimental models. When underlining the potentially
      severe evolution, we note the key role played by prompt disease recognition,
      which is expected to be more straightforward in patients monitored in endemic
      countries at high risk, but should be carefully implemented for subjects being
      admitted to hospital in Western countries suffering from the typical signs and
      symptoms of malaria, after travelling in South-East Asia where they were engaged 
      in excursions in the tropical forest (trekking, and similar outdoor activities). 
      In these cases, the diagnosis should be prompt, and suitable treatment should
      follow. According to data in the literature, in non-severe cases chloroquine
      proves very effective against P. knowlesi, achieving the disappearance of signs
      and symptoms in 96% of cases after only 24 hours after treatment start. In the
      light of the emerging epidemiological data, P. knowlesi should be added to
      Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, P. malariae, and Plasmodium falciparum, as
      the fifth aetiological agent of malaria. During the next few years, it will
      become mandatory to plan an appropriate surveillance program of the
      epidemiological evolution, paying also great attention to the clinical features
      of patients affected by P. knowlesi malaria, which are expected to worsen
      according to the time elapsed; some studies seem to point out greater severity
      according to increased parasitaemia, paralleling the increased interhuman
      infectious passages of the plasmodium.

TI  - Pyronaridine-artesunate versus mefloquine plus artesunate for malaria.
PG  - 1298-309
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1007125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyronaridine-artesunate is an artemisinin-based combination therapy
      under evaluation for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria.
      METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial
      that included 1271 patients between 3 and 60 years of age from Asia (81.3%) or
      Africa (18.7%) with microscopically confirmed, uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria. Patients underwent randomization for treatment with a fixed-dose
      combination of 180 mg of pyronaridine and 60 mg of artesunate or with 250 mg of
      mefloquine plus 100 mg of artesunate. Doses were calculated according to body
      weight and administered once daily for 3 days. RESULTS: Pyronaridine-artesunate
      was noninferior to mefloquine plus artesunate for the primary outcome: adequate
      clinical and parasitologic response in the per-protocol population on day 28,
      corrected for reinfection with the use of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)
      genotyping. For this outcome, efficacy in the group receiving
      pyronaridine-artesunate was 99.2% (743 of 749 patients; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 98.3 to 99.7) and that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate
      was 97.8% (360 of 368 patients; 95% CI, 95.8 to 99.1), with a treatment
      difference of 1.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.0 to 3.5; P=0.05). In the
      intention-to-treat population, efficacy on day 42 in the group receiving
      pyronaridine-artesunate was 83.1% (705 of 848 patients; 95% CI, 80.4 to 85.6) and
      that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate was 83.9% (355 of 423
      patients; 95% CI, 80.1 to 87.3). In Cambodia, where there were 211 study
      patients, the median parasite clearance time was prolonged for both treatments:
      64 hours versus 16.0 to 38.9 hours in other countries (P<0.001, on the basis of
      Kaplan-Meier estimates). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the recrudescence rate in the 
      intention-to-treat population in Cambodia until day 42 were higher with
      pyronaridine-artesunate than with mefloquine plus artesunate (10.2% [95% CI, 5.4 
      to 18.6] vs. 0%; P=0.04 as calculated with the log-rank test), but similar for
      the other countries combined (4.7% [95% CI, 3.3 to 6.7] and 2.8% [95% CI, 1.5 to 
      5.3], respectively; P=0.24). Elevated levels of aminotransferases were observed
      in those receiving pyronaridine-artesunate. Two patients receiving mefloquine
      plus artesunate had seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate was
      efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. In Cambodia,
      extended parasite clearance times were suggestive of in vivo resistance to
      artemisinin. (Funded by Shin Poong Pharmaceutical Company and the Medicines for

AB  - Unique peptide-morpholino oligomer (PMO) conjugates have been designed to bind
      and promote the cleavage of specific mRNA as a tool to inhibit gene function and 
      parasite growth. The new conjugates were validated using the P. falciparum gyrase
      mRNA as a target (PfGyrA). Assays in vitro demonstrated a selective degradation
      of the PfGyrA mRNA directed by the external guide sequences, which are morpholino
      oligomers in the conjugates. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that labeled
      conjugates are delivered into Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes during all
      intraerythrocytic stages of parasite development. Consistent with the expression 
      of PfGyrA in all stages of parasite development, proliferation assays showed that
      these conjugates have potent antimalarial activity, blocking early development,
      maturation, and replication of the parasite. The conjugates were equally
      effective against drug sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains. The
      potency, selectivity, and predicted safety of PMO conjugates make this approach
      attractive for the development of a unique class of target-specific antimalarials
      and for large-scale functional analysis of the malarial genome.

AB  - Microvascular sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum underlies cerebral malaria. 
      Despite suggestive ex vivo evidence, this phenomenon has not been convincingly
      demonstrated in coma complicating Plasmodium vivax malaria. Severely-ill Papua
      New Guinean children with mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections are more likely
      to develop cerebral malaria and die than those with P. falciparum alone, possibly
      reflecting P. vivax sequestration. Nested PCR was performed on post mortem brain 
      tissue from three such children dying from cerebral malaria due to mixed-species 
      infections. No P. vivax DNA was detected. These findings do not support the
      hypothesis that P. vivax sequestration occurs in human brain.

      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-based RDT and two ELISAs based on the
      detection of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) and haeme
      detoxification protein (HDP) were compared with each other and to RT-PCR at each 
      visit. RESULTS: The mean visit number (95% confidence interval) on which the
      HRP2-based RDT was still positive after treatment was 3.4 (2.7-4.1) visits with
      some patients still positive at day 28. This is significantly later than the
      pLDH-based RDT [0.84 (0.55-1.1)], microscopy (median 1, range 1-3), DHFR-TS-ELISA
      [1.7 (1.1-2.3)] and RT-PCR (median 2, range 1-5) (P < 0.05), but not
      significantly later than HDP-ELISA [2.1 (1.6-2.7)]. Lower gravidity and higher
      parasite density at day 0 resulted in significantly longer positive results with 
      most tests (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HRP2 can persist up to 28 days after ACT
      treatment; therefore, this test is not suitable for treatment follow-up in
      pregnant women and can generate problems when using this test during intermittent
      preventive treatment (IPTp). DHFR-TS is less persistent than HRP2, making it a
      potentially interesting target for diagnosis.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism of merozoite surface protein 2 and prevalence of K76T pfcrt 
      mutation in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Congolese children with
      asymptomatic infections.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to prepare the field site for future interventions, the
      prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection was evaluated in a
      cohort of children living in Brazzaville. Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
      protein 2 gene (msp2) was used to characterize the genetic diversity and the
      multiplicity of infection. The prevalence of mutant P. falciparum chloroquine
      resistance transporter (pfcrt) allele in isolates was also determined. METHODS:
      Between April and June 2010, 313 children below 10 years of age enrolled in the
      cohort for malaria surveillance were screened for P. falciparum infection using
      microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The children were selected on the
      basis of being asymptomatic. Plasmodium falciparum msp2 gene was genotyped by
      allele-specific nested PCR and the pfcrt K76T mutation was detected using nested 
      PCR followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      asymptomatic P. falciparum infections was 8.6% and 16% by microscopy and by PCR
      respectively. Allele typing of the msp2 gene detected 55% and 45% of 3D7 and FC27
      allelic families respectively. The overall multiplicity of infections (MOI) was
      1.3. A positive correlation between parasite density and multiplicity of
      infection was found. The prevalence of the mutant pfcrt allele (T76) in the
      isolates was 92%. CONCLUSION: This is the first molecular characterization of P. 
      falciparum field isolates in Congolese children, four years after changing the
      malaria treatment policy from chloroquine (CQ) to artemisinin-based combination
      therapy (ACT). The low prevalence of asymptomatic infections and MOI is discussed
      in the light of similar studies conducted in Central Africa.

TI  - Plasmodium yoelii blood-stage primes macrophage-mediated innate immune response
      through modulation of toll-like receptor signalling.
PG  - 104
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signalling is reported to be primed by the
      infection of human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. However, little is
      known about the regulation of macrophages TLR signalling by the infection of
      lethal or non-lethal strain of rodent malaria parasites. METHODS: BALB/c mice
      were infected with non-lethal strain Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL or lethal strain P. 
      yoelii 17XL. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated to study its immune response to
      pRBC lysate, and TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9) agonists, and the expression of TLRs
      and intracellular signalling molecules were also investigated by flow cytometry
      and semi-quantitive RT-PCR. RESULTS: The reactivity of peritoneal macrophages
      from the mice infected with lethal strain P. y 17XL or non-lethal strain P. y
      17XNL were enhanced to pRBC lysate, and TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists at one,
      three and five days post-infection. Of all the tested TLRs, only TLR2 was
      up-regulated on peritoneal macrophages of mice infected with either strain.
      However, transcription of intracellular signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and
      TRAF-6 was significantly up-regulated in peritoneal macrophages from mice
      infected either with P. yoelii 17XL or P. yoelii 17XNL at one, three and five
      days post-infection. However, the enhanced TLRs response of macrophage from P.
      yoelii 17XNL-infected mice persisted for a much longer time than that from P.
      yoelii 17XL-infected mice. CONCLUSION: Both P. yoelii 17XL and 17XNL strains
      could enhance the response of peritoneal macrophages to pRBC lysate and TLR
      agonists, through up-regulating the expression of TLR2 and intracellular
      signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6. In addition, prolonged high
      response of macrophage from P. yoelii 17XNL-infected mice might be associated
      with the more efficiently controlling of P. yoelii 17XNL growth in mice at early 
      stage.

TI  - Operational research to inform a sub-national surveillance intervention for
      malaria elimination in Solomon Islands.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful reduction of malaria transmission to very low levels has
      made Isabel Province, Solomon Islands, a target for early elimination by 2014.
      High malaria transmission in neighbouring provinces and the potential for local
      asymptomatic infections to cause malaria resurgence highlights the need for
      sub-national tailoring of surveillance interventions. This study contributes to a
      situational analysis of malaria in Isabel Province to inform an appropriate
      surveillance intervention. METHODS: A mixed method study was carried out in
      Isabel Province in late 2009 and early 2010. The quantitative component was a
      population-based prevalence survey of 8,554 people from 129 villages, which were 
      selected using a spatially stratified sampling approach to achieve uniform
      geographical coverage of populated areas. Diagnosis was initially based on
      Giemsa-stained blood slides followed by molecular analysis using polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). Local perceptions and practices related to management of fever
      and treatment-seeking that would impact a surveillance intervention were also
      explored using qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Approximately 33%
      (8,554/26,221) of the population of Isabel Province participated in the survey.
      Only one subject was found to be infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (96
      parasites/muL) using Giemsa-stained blood films, giving a prevalence of 0.01%.
      PCR analysis detected a further 13 cases, giving an estimated malaria prevalence 
      of 0.51%. There was a wide geographical distribution of infected subjects. None
      reported having travelled outside Isabel Province in the previous three months
      suggesting low-level indigenous malaria transmission. The qualitative findings
      provide warning signs that the current community vigilance approach to
      surveillance will not be sufficient to achieve elimination. In addition, fever
      severity is being used by individuals as an indicator for malaria and a trigger
      for timely treatment-seeking and case reporting. In light of the finding of a low
      prevalence of parasitaemia, the current surveillance system may not be able to
      detect and prevent malaria resurgence. CONCLUSION: An adaption to the malERA
      surveillance framework is proposed and recommendations made for a tailored
      provincial-level surveillance intervention, which will be essential to achieve
      elimination, and to maintain this status while the rest of the country catches
      up.

TI  - Molecular markers in plasmodium falciparum linked to resistance to anti-malarial 
      drugs in samples imported from Africa over an eight-year period (2002-2010):
      impact of the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is a major problem to control Plasmodium falciparum
      infection in endemic countries. During last decade, African countries have
      changed first-line treatment to artemisinin-based combinations therapy (ACT);
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for Intermittent Preventive
      Therapy (IPT). Molecular markers related to P falciparum resistance were analysed
      for the period of transition from SP to ACT, in isolates imported from Africa.
      METHODS: A first group of samples was taken in the period between June 2002 and
      June 2006 (n = 113); a second group in the period between November 2008 and
      August 2010 (n = 46). Several alleles were analysed by nested PCR-RFLP: 51, 59,
      108, 164, in the pfdhfr gene; 436, 437, 540, 581, in the pfdhps gene; 86, 1246,
      in the pfmdr1 gene and 76, in the pfcrt gene. The prevalence of alleles in the
      groups was compared with the chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: The
      pfdhfr N51I, C59R and S108N were over to 90% in the two groups; all samples had
      the I164. In the pfdhps, 437 G and 581 G, increased up to 80% and 10.9% (p =
      0.024), respectively in the second group. The 540 G decreases (24% to 16.%) and
      the 436A disappears at the end of the follow-up (p = 0.004) in the second group. 
      The 76I-pfcrt stayed over 95% in the two groups. Prevalence of 86Y-pfmdr1
      decreased over eight years. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological pressure affects the
      resistance strains prevalence. As for SP, the disappearance of 436A and the
      decrease in 540 G suggest that these mutations are not fixed. On the other hand, 
      studies carried out after ACT introduction show there was a selection of strains 
      carrying the SNPs N86Y, D1246Y in pfmdr1. In this work, the prevalence of pfmdr1-
      D1246Y is increasing, perhaps as a result of selective pressure by ACT. Continued
      surveillance is essential to monitor the effectiveness of treatments.

TI  - Erasing the epigenetic memory and beginning to switch--the onset of antigenic
      switching of var genes in Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - e34168
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034168 [doi]
AB  - Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum is regulated by transcriptional
      switches among members of the var gene family, each expressed in a mutually
      exclusive manner and encoding a different variant of the surface antigens
      collectively named PfEMP1. Antigenic switching starts when the first merozoites
      egress from the liver and begin their asexual proliferation within red blood
      cells. By erasing the epigenetic memory we created parasites with no var
      background, similar to merozoites that egress from the liver where no var gene is
      expressed. Creating a null-var background enabled us to investigate the onset of 
      antigenic switches at the early phase of infection. At the onset of switching,
      var transcription pattern is heterogeneous with numerous genes transcribed at low
      levels including upsA vars, a subtype that was implicated in severe malaria,
      which are rarely activated in growing cultures. Analysis of subsequent in vitro
      switches shows that the probability of a gene to turn on or off is not associated
      with its chromosomal position or promoter type per se but on intrinsic properties
      of each gene. We concluded that var switching is determined by gene specific
      associated switch rates rather than general promoter type or locus associated
      switch rates. In addition, we show that fine tuned reduction in var transcription
      increases their switch rate, indicating that transcriptional perturbation can
      alter antigenic switching.

TI  - Artesunate-amodiaquine fixed dose combination for the treatment of Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in India.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-97 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been recommended for 
      the treatment of falciparum malaria by the World Health Organization. Though
      India has already switched to ACT for treating falciparum malaria, there is need 
      to have multiple options of alternative forms of ACT. A randomized trial was
      conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of the fixed dose combination of
      artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) for the treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria for the first time in India. The study sites are
      located in malaria-endemic, chloroquine-resistant areas. METHODS: This was an
      open label, randomized trial conducted at two sites in India from January 2007 to
      January 2008. Patients between six months and 60 years of age having Plasmodium
      falciparum mono-infection were randomly allocated to ASAQ and AQ arms. The
      primary endpoint was 28-day PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate. RESULTS:
      Three hundred patients were enrolled at two participating centres, Ranchi,
      Jharkhand and Rourkela, Odisha. Two patients in AQ arm had early treatment
      failure while there was no early treatment failure in ASAQ arm. Late treatment
      failures were seen in 13 and 12 patients in ASAQ and AQ arms, respectively. The
      PCR-corrected cure rates in intent-to-treat population were 97.51% (94.6-99.1%)
      in ASAQ and 88.65% (81.3-93.9%) in AQ arms. In per-protocol population, they were
      97.47% (94.2-99.2%) and 88.30% (80-94%) in ASAQ and AQ arms respectively. Seven
      serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in five patients, of which two were
      reported as related to the treatment. All SAEs resolved without sequel.
      CONCLUSION: The fixed dose combination of ASAQ was found to be efficacious and
      safe treatment for P. falciparum malaria. Amodiaquine also showed acceptable
      efficacy, making it a suitable partner of artesunate. The combination could prove
      to be a viable option in case India opts for fixed dose combination ACT. CLINICAL
      TRIAL REGISTRY: ISRCTN84408319.

TI  - Haemolytic anaemia in an HIV-infected patient with severe falciparum malaria
      after treatment with oral artemether-lumefantrine.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-91 [doi]
AB  - Intravenous (i.v.) artesunate is now the recommended first-line treatment of
      severe falciparum malaria in adults and children by WHO guidelines. Nevertheless,
      several cases of haemolytic anaemia due to i.v. artesunate treatment have been
      reported. This paper describes the case of an HIV-infected patient with severe
      falciparum malaria who was diagnosed with haemolytic anaemia after treatment with
      oral artemether-lumefantrine.The patient presented with fever, headache, and
      arthromyalgia after returning from Central African Republic where he had been
      working. The blood examination revealed acute renal failure, thrombocytopaenia
      and hypoxia. Blood for malaria parasites indicated hyperparasitaemia (6%) and
      Plasmodium falciparum infection was confirmed by nested-PCR. Severe malaria
      according to the laboratory WHO criteria was diagnosed. A treatment with quinine 
      and doxycycline for the first 12 hours was initially administered, followed by
      arthemeter/lumefantrine (Riamet((R))) for a further three days. At day 10, a
      diagnosis of severe haemolytic anaemia was made (Hb 6.9 g/dl, LDH 2071 U/l).
      Hereditary and autoimmune disorders and other infections were excluded through
      bone marrow aspiration, total body TC scan and a wide panel of molecular and
      serologic assays. The patient was treated by transfusion of six units of packed
      blood red cell. He was discharged after complete remission at day 25. At present,
      the patient is in a good clinical condition and there is no evidence of
      haemolytic anaemia recurrence.This is the first report of haemolytic anaemia
      probably associated with oral artemether/lumefantrine. Further research is
      warranted to better define the adverse events occurring during combination
      therapy with artemisinin derivatives.

TI  - Impact of mosquito bites on asexual parasite density and gametocyte prevalence in
      asymptomatic chronic Plasmodium falciparum infections and correlation with IgE
      and IgG titers.
PG  - 2240-6
LID - 10.1128/IAI.06414-11 [doi]
AB  - An immunomodulatory role of arthropod saliva has been well documented, but
      evidence for an effect on Plasmodium sp. infectiousness remains controversial.
      Mosquito saliva may orient the immune response toward a Th2 profile, thereby
      priming a Th2 response against subsequent antigens, including Plasmodium.
      Orientation toward a Th1 versus a Th2 profile promotes IgG and IgE proliferation,
      respectively, where the former is crucial for the development of an efficient
      antiparasite immune response. Here we assessed the direct effect of mosquito
      bites on the density of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites and the
      prevalence of gametocytes in chronic, asymptomatic infections in a longitudinal
      cohort study of seasonal transmission. We additionally correlated these
      parasitological measures with IgE and IgG antiparasite and anti-salivary gland
      extract titers. The mosquito biting density was positively correlated with the
      asexual parasite density but not asexual parasite prevalence and was negatively
      correlated with gametocyte prevalence. Individual anti-salivary gland IgE titers 
      were also negatively correlated with gametocyte carriage and were strongly
      positively correlated with antiparasite IgE titers, consistent with the
      hypothesis that mosquito bites predispose individuals to develop an IgE
      antiparasite response. We provide evidence that mosquito bites have an impact on 
      asymptomatic infections and differentially so for the production of asexual and
      sexual parasites. An increased research focus on the immunological impact of
      mosquito bites during asymptomatic infections is warranted, to establish whether 
      strategies targeting the immune response to saliva can reduce the duration of
      infection and the onward transmission of the parasite.

TI  - How hidden can malaria be in pregnant women? Diagnosis by microscopy, placental
      histology, polymerase chain reaction and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 in
      plasma.
PG  - 1561-8
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of malaria infection during pregnancy remains
      challenging because of low parasite densities and placental sequestration of
      Plasmodium falciparum. The performance of different methods to detect P.
      falciparum in pregnancy and the clinical relevance of undetected infections were 
      evaluated. METHODS: P. falciparum infections were assessed in 272 Mozambican
      women at delivery by microscopy, placental histology, quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (qPCR) and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in plasma 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
      Association between infection and delivery outcomes was determined. RESULTS:
      Among the 122 women qPCR-positive for P. falciparum in peripheral and/or
      placental blood samples, 87 (71.3%) did not receive a positive diagnosis by
      peripheral microscopy, 75 (61.5%) by HRP2 ELISA, and 74 (60.7%) by HRP2 RDT in
      plasma. Fifty-seven of the 98 qPCR-positive placental infections (58.2%) were not
      detected by histology. Women who were qPCR-positive but negative in their
      peripheral blood by microscopy or HRP2 RDT in plasma (n = 62) were at increased
      risk of anemia, compared with negative women (n = 141; odds ratio, 2.03; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.07-3.83; P = .029). CONCLUSIONS: Microscopy, placental
      histology and HRP2-based plasma diagnostic methods fail to identify the majority 
      of the P. falciparum infections detected by qPCR in peripheral and placental
      blood. Undetected infections were associated with maternal anemia, highlighting
      the urgent need for more accurate malaria diagnostic tools for pregnant women to 
      avoid the negative clinical impact that hidden infections can have during
      pregnancy. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00209781.

TI  - Management of uncomplicated malaria in febrile under five-year-old children by
      community health workers in Madagascar: reliability of malaria rapid diagnostic
      tests.
PG  - 85
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-85 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis, as well as prompt and effective treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria, are essential components of the anti-malaria strategy in
      Madagascar to prevent severe malaria, reduce mortality and limit malaria
      transmission. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of the
      malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) used by community health workers (CHWs) by 
      comparing RDT results with two reference methods (microscopy and Polymerase Chain
      Reaction, PCR). METHODS: Eight CHWs in two districts, each with a different level
      of endemic malaria transmission, were trained to use RDTs in the management of
      febrile children under five years of age. RDTs were performed by CHWs in all
      febrile children who consulted for fever. In parallel, retrospective
      parasitological diagnoses were made by microscopy and PCR. The results of these
      different diagnostic methods were analysed to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      of the RDTs administered by the CHWs. The stability of the RDTs stored by CHWs
      was also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 190 febrile children with suspected malaria
      who visited CHWs between February 2009 and February 2010, 89.5% were found to be 
      positive for malaria parasites by PCR, 51.6% were positive by microscopy and
      55.8% were positive by RDT. The performance accuracy of the RDTs used by CHWs in 
      terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values was
      greater than 85%. Concordance between microscopy and RDT, estimated by the Kappa 
      value was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.91). RDTs stored by CHWs for 24 months were
      capable of detecting Plasmodium falciparum in blood at a level of 200
      parasites/mul. CONCLUSION: Introduction of easy-to-use diagnostic tools, such as 
      RDTs, at the community level appears to be an effective strategy for improving
      febrile patient management and for reducing excessive use of anti-malarial drugs.

      protein expressed in salivary gland sporozoites.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a significant problem around the
      world today, thus there is still a need for new control methods to be developed. 
      Because the sporozoite displays dual infectivity for both the mosquito salivary
      glands and vertebrate host tissue, it is a good target for vaccine development.
      METHODS: The P. falciparum gene, PF11_0394, was chosen as a candidate for study
      due to its potential role in the invasion of host tissues. This gene, which was
      selected using a data mining approach from PlasmoDB, is expressed both at the
      transcriptional and protein levels in sporozoites and likely encodes a putative
      surface protein. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
      and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-trafficking studies, a transcript and protein
      expression profile of PF11_0394 was determined. RESULTS: The PF11_0394 protein
      has orthologs in other Plasmodium species and Apicomplexans, but none outside of 
      the group Apicomplexa. PF11_0394 transcript was found to be present during both
      the sporozoite and erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle, but no
      transcript was detected during axenic exoerythrocytic stages. Despite the
      presence of transcript throughout several life cycle stages, the PF11_0394
      protein was only detected in salivary gland sporozoites. CONCLUSIONS: PF11_0394
      appears to be a protein uniquely detected in salivary gland sporozoites. Even
      though a specific function of PF11_0394 has not been determined in P. falciparum 
      biology, it could be another candidate for a new vaccine.

      expression of host-Hsp70.
PG  - e33774
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0033774 [doi]
AB  - In the early immune response to Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes
      (iRBC), Natural Killer (NK) cells are activated, which suggests an important role
      in innate anti-parasitic immunity. However, it is not well understood whether NK 
      cells directly recognize iRBC or whether stimulation of NK cells depends mainly
      on activating signals from accessory cells through cell-to-cell contact or
      soluble factors. In the present study, we investigated the influence of
      membrane-bound host Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 in triggering cytotoxicity of NK 
      cells from malaria-naive donors or the cell line NK92 against iRBC. Hsp70 and
      HLA-E membrane expression on iRBC and potential activatory NK cell receptors
      (NKG2C, CD94) were assessed by flow cytometry and immunoblot. Upon contact with
      iRBC, Granzyme B (GzmB) production and release was initiated by unstimulated and 
      Hsp70-peptide (TKD) pre-stimulated NK cells, as determined by Western blot,
      RT-PCR and ELISPOT analysis. Eryptosis of iRBC was determined by Annexin
      V-staining. Our results suggest that presence of Hsp70 and absence of HLA-E on
      the membrane of iRBC prompt the infected host cells to become targets for NK
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as evidenced by impaired parasite development.
      Contact of iRBC with NK cells induced release of GzmB. We propose that following 
      GzmB uptake, iRBC undergo eryptosis via a perforin-independent, GzmB-mediated
      mechanism. Since NK activity toward iRBC could be specifically enhanced by TKD
      peptide and abrogated to baseline levels by blocking Hsp70 exposure, we propose
      TKD as an innovative immunostimulatory agent to be tested as an adjunct to
      anti-parasitic treatments in vivo.

TI  - Inadequate efficacy of a new formulation of fosmidomycin-clindamycin combination 
      in Mozambican children less than three years old with uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria.
PG  - 2923-8
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00018-12 [doi]
AB  - The combination of fosmidomycin and clindamycin (F/C) is effective in adults and 
      older children for the treatment of malaria and could be an important alternative
      to existing artemisinin-based combinations (ACTs) if proven to work in younger
      children. We conducted an open-label clinical trial to assess the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of F/C for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum 
      malaria in Mozambican children <3 years of age. Aqueous solutions of the drugs
      were given for 3 days, and the children were followed up for 28 days. The primary
      outcome was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response at
      day 28. Secondary outcomes included day 7 and 28 uncorrected cure rates and fever
      (FCT) and parasite (PCT) clearance times. Fifty-two children were recruited, but 
      only 37 patients were evaluable for the primary outcome. Day 7 cure rates were
      high (94.6%; 35/37), but the day 28 PCR-corrected cure rate was 45.9% (17/37).
      The FCT was short (median, 12 h), but the PCT was longer (median, 72 h) than in
      previous studies. Tolerability was good, and most common adverse events were
      related to the recurrence of malaria. The poor efficacy observed for the F/C
      combination may be a consequence of the new formulations used, differential
      bioavailability in younger children, naturally occurring variations in parasite
      sensitivity to the drugs, or an insufficient enhancement of their effects by
      naturally acquired immunity in young children. Additional studies should be
      conducted to respond to the many uncertainties arising from this trial, which
      should not discourage further evaluation of this promising combination.

      Slides were read in duplicate. The overall mean (95% confidence interval; range) 
      PCT in hours was 23.2 (21.2-25.3; 12-46) and 22.4 (20.3-24.5; 12-46) for the
      first and second microscopists, respectively (P = 0.57). Ten (23%) patients
      remained parasitemic on day 1 after treatment (4 [18%] in group 1 and 6 [27%] in 
      group 2; P = 0.47). No patient had patent asexual parasitemia on the second and
      third days of treatment. The 42-day polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure
      rates were 100% in both treatment groups. Serious adverse events did not develop 
      during or after treatment in any patients. In conclusion, no evidence of P.
      falciparum in vivo resistance to artesunate was found in southern Laos.

AB  - To detect pre-patent parasitemia, we developed a real-time quantitative reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the asexual 18S ribosomal
      RNA (rRNAs) of Plasmodium falciparum. Total nucleic acids extracted from whole
      blood were combined with control RNA and tested by qRT-PCR. The assay quantified 
      > 98.7% of parasite-containing samples to +/-0.5 log(10) parasites/mL of the
      nominal value without false positives. The analytical sensitivity was >/= 20
      parasites/mL. The coefficient of variation was 0.6% and 1.8% within runs and 1.6%
      and 4.0% between runs for high and low parasitemia specimens, respectively. Using
      this assay, we determined that A-type 18S rRNAs are stably expressed at 1 x 10(4)
      copies per ring-stage parasite. When used to monitor experimental P. falciparum
      infection of human volunteers, the assay detected blood-stage infections 3.7 days
      earlier on average than thick blood smears. This validated, internally controlled
      qRT-PCR method also uses a small (50 muL) sample volume requiring minimal
      pre-analytical handling, making it useful for clinical trials.

TI  - Cloning and characterization of trichome-specific promoter of cpr71av1 gene
      involved in artemisinin biosynthesis in Artemisia annua L.
PG  - 817-24
AB  - Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived from Artemisia annua L.
      (Asteraceae), is the most effective antimalarial drug. We used two methods:
      genome walking and thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction, to
      isolate the unknown 5'-flanking sequence of the cyp71av1 gene. The subsequent
      sequence analysis using bioinformatics software revealed that there are several
      cis-acting elements inside the cyp71av1 promoter. The 5'-rapid amplification of
      the cDNA ends method was used to determine the transcription start site of the
      cyp71av1 gene. We then mapped it at the 18 base upstream of the ATG initiation
      codon. For simple functional characterization, we built fusion vectors between
      the 5'-deletion promoter and the gas reporter gene. The expression levels of the 
      transferred vectors into A. annua L. were analyzed by the transient expression
      way. The beta-glucuronidase assay results indicated that deletion of the region
      to -1551 bp did not lead to much damage in the GUS activity, whereas further
      deletion, to -1155 bp, resulted in a 5.5-fold reduction of GUS activity. In
      stabilized transgenic A. annua L. seedlings we observed that GUS expression was
      restricted to trichomes, which means that the promoter of the cyp71av1 gene is
      trichome-specific. Compared with the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, which can
      express genes throughout the plant, influence on the trichome system through the 
      trichome-specific expression promoter merely imperils plant growth. In addition, 
      the promoter of the cyp71av1 gene contains several binding sites for
      transcription factors, which implies that the cyp71av1 promoter responds to more 
      than one form of stimulation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0032891 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of the composition of multi-clonal malarial infections and the 
      epidemiological factors which shape their diversity remain poorly understood.
      Traditionally within-host diversity has been defined in terms of the multiplicity
      of infection (MOI) derived by PCR-based genotyping. Massively parallel, single
      molecule sequencing technologies now enable individual read counts to be derived 
      on genome-wide datasets facilitating the development of new statistical
      approaches to describe within-host diversity. In this class of measures the F(WS)
      metric characterizes within-host diversity and its relationship to population
      level diversity. Utilizing P. falciparum field isolates from patients in West
      Africa we here explore the relationship between the traditional MOI and F(WS)
      approaches. F(WS) statistics were derived from read count data at 86,158 SNPs in 
      64 samples sequenced on the Illumina GA platform. MOI estimates were derived by
      PCR at the msp-1 and -2 loci. Significant correlations were observed between the 
      two measures, particularly with the msp-1 locus (P = 5.92x10(-5)). The F(WS)
      metric should be more robust than the PCR-based approach owing to reduced
      sensitivity to potential locus-specific artifacts. Furthermore the F(WS) metric
      captures information on a range of parameters which influence out-crossing risk
      including the number of clones (MOI), their relative proportions and genetic
      divergence. This approach should provide novel insights into the factors which
      correlate with, and shape within-host diversity.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2864-3 [doi]
AB  - Reactive oxygen species produced from hemoglobin digestion and the host immune
      system could have adverse effects on malaria parasites. To protect themselves,
      malaria parasites are highly dependent on the antioxidant enzymes, including
      superoxide dismutases and thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases. To date, several
      thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx) have been characterized in Plasmodium falciparum,
      but the TPx in Plasmodium vivax has not yet been characterized. The complete
      sequence of gene coding for thioredoxin peroxidase-1 of P. vivax (PvTPx-1) was
      amplified by PCR and cloned. Using the recombinant PvTPx-1 (rPvTPx-1), polyclonal
      antibody was produced in mice for immunolocalization of the enzyme in the
      parasite. The antioxidant activity of rPvTPx-1 was evaluated by mixed-function
      oxidation assay. PvTPx-1 has two conserved cysteine residues in the amino acid
      sequence at the positions 50 and 170 which formed a dimer under a non-reducing
      condition. Using a thiol mixed-function oxidation assay, the antioxidant activity
      of rPvTPx-1 was revealed. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with the
      specific antibody indicated that PvTPx-1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of the
      erythrocytic stage of the parasite in a dots-like pattern. The results suggest
      that P. vivax uses TPx-1 to reduce and detoxify hydrogen peroxides in order to
      maintain their redox homeostasis and proliferation in the host body.

TI  - Increased sensitivity for detecting malaria parasites in human umbilical cord
      blood using scaled-up DNA preparation.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-62 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: All mothers donating umbilical cord blood units to the NHS cord blood
      bank undergo an assessment for the likelihood of prior exposure to malaria
      infection. Those deemed at risk due to a history of travel to, or residence in,
      malaria endemic regions are screened serologically to detect anti-malaria
      antibodies. A positive result excludes the use of the cord blood for transplant
      therapy unless a risk assessment can ensure that malaria transmission is
      extremely unlikely. This paper details the screening of cord blood units from
      malaria serology positive mothers to detect malaria parasite DNA using a highly
      sensitive nested PCR. METHODS: Uninfected blood from a healthy volunteer was
      spiked with known quantities of malaria parasites and 5 millilitre and 200
      microlitre aliquots were subjected to DNA extraction using QIAamp DNA maxi and
      DNA mini kits respectively. Nested PCR, to detect malarial SSU rRNA sequences,
      was performed on the purified DNA samples to determine the limit of detection for
      this assay with both extraction methodologies. Following assay validation, 54
      cord blood units donated by mothers who were positive for anti-malaria antibodies
      were screened by this approach. RESULTS: When DNA was purified from 5 millilitres
      of blood it was possible to routinely detect as few as 50 malaria parasites per
      millilitre using nested PCR. This equates to a significant increase in the
      sensitivity of the current gold standard nucleic acid amplification technique
      used to detect malaria parasites (routinely performed from > 200 microlitre
      volumes of blood). None of the 54 donated cord blood units from serology positive
      mothers tested positive for malaria parasites using this scaled up DNA
      preparation method. CONCLUSION: Serological testing for malaria parasites may be 
      overly conservative, leading to unnecessary rejection of cord blood donations
      that lack malaria parasites and which are, therefore, safe for use in stem cell
      therapy.

      to three different histone deacetylase inhibitors.
PG  - e31847
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0031847 [doi]
AB  - Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are being intensively pursued as potential 
      new drugs for a range of diseases, including malaria. HDAC inhibitors are also
      important tools for the study of epigenetic mechanisms, transcriptional control, 
      and other important cellular processes. In this study the effects of three
      structurally related antimalarial HDAC inhibitors on P. falciparum malaria
      parasite gene expression were compared. The three hydroxamate-based compounds,
      trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; Vorinostat(R)) and a
      2-aminosuberic acid derivative (2-ASA-9), all caused profound transcriptional
      effects, with ~2-21% of genes having >2-fold altered expression following 2 h
      exposure to the compounds. Only two genes, alpha tubulin II and a hydrolase, were
      up-regulated by all three compounds after 2 h exposure in all biological
      replicates examined. The transcriptional changes observed after 2 h exposure to
      HDAC inhibitors were found to be largely transitory, with only 1-5% of genes
      being regulated after removing the compounds and culturing for a further 2 h.
      Despite some structural similarity, the three inhibitors caused quite diverse
      transcriptional effects, possibly reflecting subtle differences in mode of action
      or cellular distribution. This dataset represents an important contribution to
      our understanding of how HDAC inhibitors act on malaria parasites and identifies 
      alpha tubulin II as a potential transcriptional marker of HDAC inhibition in
      malaria parasites that may be able to be exploited for future development of HDAC
      inhibitors as new antimalarial agents.

AB  - The combination therapy of the Artemisinin-derivative Artemether (ART) with
      Lumefantrine (LM) (Coartem(R)) is an important malaria treatment regimen in many 
      endemic countries. Resistance to Artemisinin has already been reported, and it is
      feared that LM resistance (LMR) could also evolve quickly. Therefore molecular
      markers which can be used to track Coartem(R) efficacy are urgently needed.
      Often, stable resistance arises from initial, unstable phenotypes that can be
      identified in vitro. Here we have used the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug
      resistant reference strain V1S to induce LMR in vitro by culturing the parasite
      under continuous drug pressure for 16 months. The initial IC(50) (inhibitory
      concentration that kills 50% of the parasite population) was 24 nM. The resulting
      resistant strain V1S(LM), obtained after culture for an estimated 166 cycles
      under LM pressure, grew steadily in 378 nM of LM, corresponding to 15 times the
      IC(50) of the parental strain. However, after two weeks of culturing V1S(LM) in
      drug-free medium, the IC(50) returned to that of the initial, parental strain
      V1S. This transient drug tolerance was associated with major changes in gene
      expression profiles: using the PFSANGER Affymetrix custom array, we identified
      184 differentially expressed genes in V1S(LM). Among those are 18 known and
      putative transporters including the multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1), the
      multidrug resistance associated protein and the V-type H+ pumping pyrophosphatase
      2 (pfvp2) as well as genes associated with fatty acid metabolism. In addition we 
      detected a clear selective advantage provided by two genomic loci in parasites
      grown under LM drug pressure, suggesting that all, or some of those genes
      contribute to development of LM tolerance--they may prove useful as molecular
      markers to monitor P. falciparum LM susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a real-time PCR method for human Plasmodium spp.
      qantitative detection and species identificaton. METHODS: According to the
      sequence of Plasmodium 18S rRNA, the primer set was designed based on the
      genus-specific region around the species-specfic region. The PCR products were
      amplified and cloned into pGEM-T vector to produce standard plasmids of real-time
      PCR, and melting curve analysis was conducted following real-time PCR for
      Plasmodium species indentification. RESULTS: By using the primer set, specific
      PCR products were produced from all of 4 human malaria parasites. The correlation
      of real-time PCR standard curve was good enough (r = -1.00) for quantitation.
      According to the melting curve analysis, the melting temperatures (Tm) of
      Plasmodium malariae, falciparum, ovale and vivax were significantly different,
      being 71.3, 72.8, 74.6 degrees C and 75.8 degrees C, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      The SYBR Green I based real-time PCR method developed in this study can be used
      for human Plasmodium spp. quantitative detection and species identificaton.

TI  - Malaria surveillance--United States, 2010.
PG  - 1-17
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of
      the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective
      female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United
      States occur among persons who have traveled to areas with ongoing malaria
      transmission. In the United States, cases can occur through exposure to infected 
      blood products, congenital transmission, or local mosquito-borne transmission.
      Malaria surveillance is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and 
      to guide prevention recommendations for travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report
      summarizes cases in persons with onset of illness in 2010 and summarizes trends
      during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood
      film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be
      reported to local and state health departments by health-care providers or
      laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health
      departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria
      Surveillance System (NMSS), National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
      (NNDSS), or direct CDC consults. Data from these reporting systems serve as the
      basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received 1,691 reported cases of malaria,
      including 1,688 cases classified as imported, one transfusion-related case, and
      two cryptic cases, with an onset of symptoms in 2010 among persons in the United 
      States. The total number of cases represents an increase of 14% from the 1,484
      cases reported for 2009. Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P.
      ovale were identified in 58%, 19%, 2%, and 2% of cases, respectively. Thirteen
      patients were infected by two or more species. The infecting species was
      unreported or undetermined in 18% of cases. Among the 898 cases in U.S. civilians
      for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel area was known, 45 (5%)
      reported that they had followed and adhered to a chemoprophylactic drug regimen
      recommended by CDC for the areas to which they had traveled. Forty-one cases were
      reported in pregnant women, among whom only two (5%) adhered to chemoprophylaxis.
      Among all reported cases, 176 (10%) were classified as severe infections, of
      which nine were fatal. INTERPRETATION: The number of cases reported in 2010
      marked the largest number of cases reported since 1980. Despite the apparent
      progress in reducing the global burden of malaria, many areas remain malaria
      endemic and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still
      inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR)
      continue to be a difficult population to reach with effective malaria prevention 
      strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies that effectively target VFR
      travelers need to be developed and implemented to have a substantial impact on
      the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States. A large number of
      pregnant travelers diagnosed with malaria did not take any chemoprophylaxis.
      Pregnant women traveling to areas in which malaria is endemic are at higher risk 
      for severe malaria and must use appropriate malaria prevention strategies
      including chemoprophylaxis. Malaria prevention recommendations are available
      online (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can 
      be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications
      appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of
      malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.
      Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria and contact
      the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advice, when needed. Malaria
      treatment recommendations can be obtained online
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling the Malaria
      Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713).

TI  - Autopsy discoveries of death from malaria.
PG  - 111-5
LID - 10.1016/j.legalmed.2012.01.007 [doi]
AB  - Malaria inflicts a huge health care burden in terms of mortality and morbidity
      worldwide. There has been evidence in the literature where many
      unexpected/unexplained deaths turned out to be related to malaria on autopsy. The
      aim of this study is to review autopsy diagnosed malaria related deaths in the
      literature with due stress to its biologic and forensic aspects. A meticulous
      literature search was performed for "sudden malaria death", "malaria death
      postmortem diagnosis" and "unexplained death malaria" across PubMed, SCOPUS,
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Allied and Complementary Medicine,
      British Nursing Index, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid-MEDLINE and Google Scholar. All the
      literature was thoroughly reviewed and analyzed with reference to the type of
      study, location, travel history, age, gender, circumstance of death, method of
      diagnosis, species involved, chemoprophylaxis usage and take home message from
      the particular study. Plasmodium falciparum was responsible in most of the cases.
      The symptoms mimicked influenza in most of the case reports. Travel to endemic
      areas was common to most of the victims. The travelers were from all over the
      world including USA, France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Asia
      (China and Japan). Vascular congestion with the presence of malarial pigment
      laden RBCs in capillaries of various organs was the major histopathology finding.
      Such lesions were found in the brains of all subjects (100%), liver of 78% of the
      cases, spleen in 67%, lungs in 56% and myocardium in 43% of the cases. Peripheral
      smear and rapid diagnostic test was of great aid to the autopsy in many cases.
      PCR was used for diagnosis as well as exclusion of possibility of co-infection
      with other species in case of Plasmodium knowlesi related death. The postmortem
      and histopathology findings in this case were similar to P. falciparum except for
      the fact that brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1.
      Chemoprophylaxis was not taken by the victims except for two in whom history of
      chloroquine based chemoprophylaxis was mentioned. Given the worldwide prevalence 
      of the disease, increasing international travel and rapidly developing drug
      resistance, malaria will continue to be an important disease and should be
      considered in all cases of unexpected deaths particularly in malaria endemic
      regions or in presence of travel history to endemic regions.

TI  - A new single-step PCR assay for the detection of the zoonotic malaria parasite
      Plasmodium knowlesi.
PG  - e31848
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0031848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies in Southeast Asia have demonstrated substantial
      zoonotic transmission of Plasmodium knowlesi to humans. Microscopically, P.
      knowlesi exhibits several stage-dependent morphological similarities to P.
      malariae and P. falciparum. These similarities often lead to misdiagnosis of P.
      knowlesi as either P. malariae or P. falciparum and PCR-based molecular
      diagnostic tests are required to accurately detect P. knowlesi in humans. The
      most commonly used PCR test has been found to give false positive results,
      especially with a proportion of P. vivax isolates. To address the need for more
      sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for the accurate diagnosis of P.
      knowlesi, we report development of a new single-step PCR assay that uses novel
      genomic targets to accurately detect this infection. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT 
      FINDINGS: We have developed a bioinformatics approach to search the available
      malaria parasite genome database for the identification of suitable DNA sequences
      relevant for molecular diagnostic tests. Using this approach, we have identified 
      multi-copy DNA sequences distributed in the P. knowlesi genome. We designed and
      tested several novel primers specific to new target sequences in a single-tube,
      non-nested PCR assay and identified one set of primers that accurately detects P.
      knowlesi. We show that this primer set has 100% specificity for the detection of 
      P. knowlesi using three different strains (Nuri, H, and Hackeri), and one human
      case of malaria caused by P. knowlesi. This test did not show cross reactivity
      with any of the four human malaria parasite species including 11 different
      strains of P. vivax as well as 5 additional species of simian malaria parasites. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The new PCR assay based on novel P. knowlesi genomic sequence
      targets was able to accurately detect P. knowlesi. Additional laboratory and
      field-based testing of this assay will be necessary to further validate its
      utility for clinical diagnosis of P. knowlesi.

TI  - Evidence of Endothelial Activation in Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum
      Parasitemia and Effect of Blood Group on Levels of von Willebrand Factor in
      Malaria.
PG  - 16-25
LID - 10.1093/jpids/pis010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial activation may contribute to development of severe
      disease from Plasmodium falciparum infection, but optimal markers of endothelial 
      activation in severe malaria, the extent of endothelial activation in
      asymptomatic infection, and the effect of blood group O on endothelial activation
      have not been defined. METHODS: Serum levels of 3 markers of endothelial
      activation-von Willebrand factor (VWF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
      (sICAM-1), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)-were assessed 
      in Ugandan children with cerebral malaria (CM) (n = 86), children with
      uncomplicated malaria (UM) (n = 81), and community children (CC) (n = 90).
      RESULTS: Serum VWF, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 levels were all elevated in asymptomatic
      community children with microscopy-confirmed parasitemia when compared with
      children without parasitemia by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (all, P
      </= .05). Levels of VWF, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 were higher in children with UM
      than in CC (all, P < 0.001), but only VWF levels effectively distinguished CM
      from UM (P < 0.001), a finding confirmed by receiver operating characteristic
      analyses (area under the curve = 0.67; 95% confidence interval, .58-.75). Von
      Willebrand factor levels were lower in children with blood group O versus non-O
      blood groups across the disease spectrum, but VWF levels remained higher in CM
      versus UM, even after controlling for blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial
      activation, as assessed by serum levels of VWF, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1, occurs even
      in subclinical P. falciparum parasitemia. Von Willebrand factor levels increase
      with greater malaria disease severity. Blood group O is associated with lower VWF
      levels, but presence of blood group O alone does not explain the higher VWF
      levels seen in children with CM.

TI  - Ubiquitin proteasome system and the atypical kinase PfPK7 are involved in
      melatonin signaling in Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 147-53

AB  - We previously reported that melatonin modulates the Plasmodium falciparum
      erythrocytic cycle by increasing schizont stage population as well as diminishing
      ring stage population. In addition, the importance of calcium and cAMP in
      melatonin signaling pathway in P. falciparum was also demonstrated. Nevertheless,
      the molecular effectors of the indoleamine signaling pathway remain elusive. We
      now demonstrate by real-time PCR that melatonin treatment up-regulates genes
      related to ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) components and that luzindole, a
      melatonin receptor antagonist, inhibits UPS transcription modulation. We also
      show that protein kinase PfPK7, a P. falciparum orphan kinase, plays a crucial
      role in the melatonin transduction pathway, since following melatonin treatment
      of P. falciparum parasites where pfpk7 gene is disrupted (pfpk7(-) parasites) (i)
      the ratio of asexual stages remain unchanged, (ii) the increase in cytoplasmatic 
      calcium in response to melatonin was strongly diminished and (iii) up-regulation 
      of UPS genes did not occur. The wild-type melatonin-induced alterations in cell
      cycle features, calcium rise and UPS gene transcription were restored by
      re-introduction of a functional copy of the pfpk7 gene in the pfpk7(-) parasites.

TI  - Quantification of Plasmodium falciparum malaria from complex infections in the
      Peruvian Amazon using quantitative PCR of the merozoite surface protein 1, block 
      2 (PfMSP1-B2): in vitro dynamics reveal density-dependent interactions.
PG  - 701-8
LID - 10.1017/S0031182011002393 [doi]
AB  - The majority of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates are defined as complex
      infections because they contain multiple genetically distinct clones. Studying
      interactions between clones in complex infections in vivo and in vitro could
      elucidate important phenomena in malaria infection, transmission and treatment.
      Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1,
      block 2 (PfMSP1-B2), we provide a sensitive and efficient genotyping method. This
      is important for epidemiological studies because it makes it possible to study
      genotype-specific growth dynamics. We compared 3 PfMSP1-B2 genotyping methods by 
      analysing 79 field isolates from the Peruvian Amazon. In vivo observations from
      other studies using these techniques led to the hypothesis that clones within
      complex infections interact. By co-culturing clones with different PfMSP1-B2
      genotypes, and measuring parasitaemia using qPCR, we found that suppression of
      clonal expansion was a factor of the collective density of all clones present in 
      a culture. PfMSP1-B2 qPCR enabled us to find in vitro evidence for
      parasite-parasite interactions and could facilitate future investigations of
      growth trends in naturally occurring complex infections.

TI  - Artemisinin-naphthoquine combination therapy for uncomplicated pediatric malaria:
      a tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy study.
PG  - 2465-71
LID - 10.1128/AAC.06248-11 [doi]
AB  - Artemisinin-naphthoquine (ART-NQ) is a fixed-dose coformulated antimalarial
      therapy recommended as a single-dose treatment and marketed in Papua New Guinea
      among other tropical countries. We conducted a tolerability, safety, and efficacy
      study of ART-NQ for Papua New Guinean children aged 5 to 12 years with
      uncomplicated malaria, comparing single-dose ART-NQ (15 and 6 mg/kg of body
      weight) given with water (group 1; n = 15), single-dose ART-NQ (22 and 9 mg/kg)
      given with milk (group 2; n = 17), or two daily doses of 22 and 9 mg/kg given
      with water (group 3; n = 16). Of the 48 children (45 with Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria, 2 with Plasmodium vivax malaria, and 1 with mixed-species malaria), 2 in
      group 2 did not attend all follow-up assessments. All regimens were well
      tolerated, with no serious adverse events. There were no clinically significant
      changes in pulse, blood pressure, rate-corrected electrocardiographic QT, routine
      biochemistry/hematology, or hearing after treatment. Fever clearance was prompt. 
      Mean 50% parasite clearance times were 4, 4, and 5 h for groups 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively. One group 1 patient had PCR-confirmed P. falciparum recrudescence
      at day 23; four had PCR-confirmed P. falciparum reinfections on day 28 or 42; and
      three had P. vivax infections detected on day 42. The only recurrent parasitemia 
      in groups 2 and 3 occurred in a group 2 child who developed a P. vivax infection 
      on day 42. Day 14 gametocyte positivity levels were 20%, 27%, and 9% in groups 1,
      2, and 3, respectively. The lower single ART-NQ dose was associated with
      relatively frequent recurrence of parasitemia, but the prolonged gametocytemia in
      all three groups has implications for the transmission of malaria.

PG  - 208-14
LID - 10.1007/s13149-012-0211-7 [doi]
AB  - The Ministry of Health recommended in Benin, since 2004, artemisinin-based
      combination, artemether-lumtefantrine (Coartem(R)), therapy for the treatment of 
      uncomplicated malaria. To resolve the difficulties related to observance, we are 
      interested in a new combination, artemisinin-naphthoquine (Arco(R)). A study was 
      conducted to assess and compare the efficacy and tolerability of the fixed
      combination artemisinin (125 mg)-naphthoquine (50 mg), a single-dose drug,
      administered one day versus artemether (20 mg)-lumefantrine (120 mg).The clinical
      assessment was a single-blinded, two-arm, randomized trial comparing Arco(R)
      combination as a single-dose regimen and three-day regimen of Coartem(R) for the 
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, from july to october 2008 and may 
      to september 2009, with 28 days of follow-up in children. PCR genotyping was used
      to classify re-infection or recrudescence. The primary outcome measures for
      efficacy were cure rates on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Secondary outcomes included
      parasite clearance time and fever clearance time. The main outcome measures for
      safety were incidences of post-treatment clinical and laboratory adverse events. 
      A total of 174 patients (84 in Arco(R) group and 90 in Coartem(R) group) were
      evaluated for clinical and parasitological outcomes. The cure rate was 98.8% for 
      Arco(R) and 100% for Coartem(R) on day 28, with no statistically significant
      difference. Fever clearance was obtained within 24 hours in both groups. The
      parasite clearance is obtained at 48 hours in Arco(R) group and at 60 hours in
      Coartem(R) group. Both treatments were well tolerated without major side effects.
      This study therefore concluded that the combination of artemisinin-naphthoquine
      is as effective and well tolerated as the combination artemether-lumefantrine in 
      the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Benin children. This medication
      administered in single dose is therapy of choice to reduce compliance problems
      during malaria treatment and also to facilitate community-based care of malaria.

TI  - Genetic diversity in merozoite surface protein-1 and 2 among Plasmodium
      falciparum isolates from malarious districts of tribal dominant state of
      Jharkhand, India.
PG  - 579-92
LID - 10.1179/2047773211Y.0000000012 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The genetic make-up of malaria parasite is potent for understanding
      the parasite virulence, designing antimalarial vaccine and evaluating the impact 
      of malaria control measures. There is a paucity of information on genetic
      structure of Plasmodium falciparum in Jharkhand, India where malaria is rampant
      and this study aimed to establish molecular characterization of P. falciparum
      field isolates from Jharkhand measured with two highly polymorphic genetic
      markers, i.e. the merozoite surface proteins (MSPs) 1 and 2. METHODS: The genetic
      diversity of P. falciparum population from low transmission area, Ranchi, Bokaro 
      and Hazaribagh and highly malarious area, Latehar and Palamau districts of
      Jharkhand were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing analyzing msp-1 
      and msp-2 genes to explore the genetic structure of parasite from this
      understudied region. RESULTS: A total of 134 P. falciparum isolates were analyzed
      by polymorphic regions of msp-1 and msp-2 and classified according to prevalence 
      of allelic families. The majority of patients from all the five sites had mean
      monoclonal infections of 67.1 and 60.4% of P. falciparum for msp-1 and msp-2,
      respectively, whereas, mean multiple genotypes of 32.8 and 39.5% for msp-1 and
      msp-2, respectively. Interestingly, we observed higher multiclonal infection in
      low transmission area as compared to highly malarious area in the case of msp-1
      genotypes, whereas in msp-2 higher multiclonal infection was observed in highly
      malarious area compared to low transmission area. The overall multiplicities of
      infection of msp-1 and msp-2 were 1.38 and 1.39, respectively. CONCLUSION: This
      is the first report on molecular characterization of P. falciparum field isolates
      from Jharkhand. The genetic diversity and allelic distribution found in this
      study is somewhat similar to other reports from India and Southeast Asian
      countries. However, P. falciparum infection can be highly complex and diverse in 
      these disease-endemic regions of Jharkhand, suggesting continual genetic mixing
      that could have significant implications for the use of antimalarial drugs and
      vaccines.

AB  - In order to implement community case management of malaria strategy in a rural
      area of intense transmission, of children using artemether-lumefantrine
      combination, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the medicine. We conducted
      an open label and uncontrolled clinical trial in an unique centre from September 
      2009 to December 2009 in children 6-59 months old who consulted at health
      facilities for uncomplicated malaria. The primary endpoint was clinical and
      parasitological cure rate at day 28 corrected by PCR. In total 106 children were 
      enrolled. Parasite clearance at day 2 was 99.04% and the adequate clinical and
      parasitological response corrected by PCR at day 28 was 90.5%. Our results
      confirm that artemether-lumefantrine combination is still effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is still a need to improve the sensitivity of polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) tests for malaria to detect submicroscopic asexual stage
      Plasmodium infections during the early phase and chronic, asymptomatic phase of
      infection when the parasite burden is very low. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The
      inhibitory effect of hemoglobin (Hb) on PCR limits the volume of blood that can
      be used in the PCR-based detection of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium parasites. We 
      lysed red blood cells with saponin to reduce the Hb concentration in extracted
      nucleic acid and, as a result, significantly increased the volume of blood that
      can be tested by PCR. The analytical sensitivity of the PCR was determined using 
      whole blood spiked with ring-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites, and its
      clinical sensitivity by testing blood film-positive and blood film-negative
      samples from individuals living in an endemic area in Ghana. RESULTS: We have
      developed a pan-Plasmodium PCR that detects all five human Plasmodium species
      with the highest analytical sensitivity of two P. falciparum parasites/mL of
      whole blood and species-specific PCR tests that distinguished between the five
      human Plasmodium species. Pan-Plasmodium PCR detected 78 of 78 (100%) blood
      film-positive and 19 of 101 (18.81%) blood film-negative samples from
      asymptomatic individuals living in Ghana. Pan-Plasmodium PCR was equally
      sensitive with samples collected as anticoagulated whole blood and clotted blood 
      and in blood collected by finger stick into capillaries. CONCLUSION: We have
      developed PCR tests with the highest reported sensitivity to date for
      pan-Plasmodium diagnosis and species-specific diagnosis and detected blood
      film-negative asymptomatic infections in individuals living in malaria-endemic
      countries.

TI  - Comparative efficacies of artemisinin combination therapies in Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria and polymorphism of pfATPase6, pfcrt, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes
      in tea gardens of Jalpaiguri District, India.

AB  - In India, chloroquine has been replaced by a combination of artesunate and
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS-SP) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Other 
      available combinations, artemether-lumefantrine (AM-LF) and artesunate-mefloquine
      (AS-MQ), not included in the national program, are widely used by private
      practitioners. Little is known about the therapeutic efficacy of these
      artemisinin combinations and the prevalence of molecular markers associated with 
      antimalarial drug resistance. A total of 157 patients with P. falciparum
      monoinfection were recruited and randomized into three study groups (AS-SP,
      AM-LF, and AS-MQ). All patients were followed up for 42 days to study the
      clinical and parasitological responses according to the WHO protocol (2009). We
      assessed the polymorphism of the pfATPase6, pfcrt, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes by
      the DNA-sequencing method. The PCR-corrected therapeutic efficacies of AS-SP,
      AM-LF, and AS-MQ were 90.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.793 to 0.969), 95.9%
      (95% CI, 0.860 to 0.995), and 100% (95% CI, 0.927 to 1.00), respectively. No
      specific mutational pattern was observed in the pfATPase6 gene. All isolates had 
      a K76T mutation in the pfcrt gene. In the pfdhfr-pfdhps genotype, quadruple
      mutation was frequent, and quintuple mutation was documented in 6.3% of P.
      falciparum isolates. The significant failure rate of AS-SP (9.5%), although
      within the limit (10%) for drug policy change, was due to SP failure because of
      prevailing mutations in pfdhfr, I(51)R(59)N(108), with pfdhps, G(437) and/or
      E(540). The efficacy of this ACT needs periodic monitoring.
      Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine are effective alternatives to
      the artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination.

      Thailand.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-36 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria parasite, has been reported in 
      humans in many Southeast Asian countries. In Thailand, most of the limited
      numbers of cases reported so far were from areas near neighbouring countries,
      including Myanmar. METHODS: Blood samples collected from 171 Thai and 248
      Myanmese patients attending a malaria clinic in Ranong province, Thailand,
      located near the Myanmar border were investigated for P. knowlesi using nested
      PCR assays. Positive samples were also investigated by PCR for Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale, and were 
      confirmed by sequencing the gene encoding the circumsporozoite protein (csp).
      RESULTS: Two samples, one obtained from a Thai and the other a Myanmese, were
      positive for P. knowlesi only. Nucleotide sequences of the csp gene derived from 
      these two patients were identical and phylogenetically indistinguishable from
      other P. knowlesi sequences derived from monkeys and humans. Both patients worked
      in Koh Song, located in the Kawthoung district of Myanmar, which borders
      Thailand. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that transmission of P. knowlesi is
      occurring in the Ranong province of Thailand or the Kawthoung district of
      Myanmar. Further studies are required to assess the incidence of knowlesi malaria
      and whether macaques in these areas are the source of the infections.

TI  - Genetic diversity and natural selection at the domain I of apical membrane
      antigen-1 (AMA-1) of Plasmodium falciparum in isolates from Iran.
PG  - 456-62
LID - 10.1016/j.exppara.2012.01.006 [doi]
AB  - The apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a prime malaria
      asexual blood-stage vaccine candidate. Antigenic variation is one of the main
      obstacles in the development of a universal effective malaria vaccine. The
      extracellular region of P. falciparum AMA-1 (PfAMA-1) consists of three domains
      (I-III), of which the domain I is the most diverse region of this antigen. The
      objective of our study was to investigate and analyze the extent of genetic
      diversity and the effectiveness of natural selection at the AMA-1 domain I of P. 
      falciparum in isolates from Iran. A fragment of ama-1 gene spanning domain I was 
      amplified by nested PCR from 48 P. falciparum isolates collected from two major
      malaria endemic areas of Iran during 2009 to August 2010 and sequenced. Genetic
      polymorphism and statistical analyses were performed using DnaSP and MEGA
      software packages. Analysis of intrapopulation diversity revealed relatively high
      nucleotide and haplotype diversity at the PfAMA-1 domain I of Iranian isolates.
      Neutrality tests provided strong evidence of positive natural selection acting on
      the sequenced gene region. The findings also demonstrated that, in addition to
      natural selection, intragenic recombination may contribute to the diversity
      observed at the domain I. The results obtained will have significant implications
      in the design and the development of an AMA-1-based vaccine against falciparum
      malaria.

PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytoadherence of infected red blood cells to brain endothelium is
      causally implicated in malarial coma, one of the severe manifestations of
      falciparum malaria. Cytoadherence is mediated by specific binding of variant
      parasite antigens, expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, to
      endothelial receptors including, ICAM-1, VCAM and CD36. In fatal cases of severe 
      falciparum malaria with coma, blood vessels in the brain are characteristically
      congested with infected erythrocytes. Brain sections from a fatal case of
      knowlesi malaria, but without coma, were similarly congested with infected
      erythrocytes. The objective of this study was to determine the binding phenotype 
      of Plasmodium knowlesi infected human erythrocytes to recombinant human ICAM-1,
      VCAM and CD36. METHODS: Five patients with PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi malaria were
      recruited into the study with consent between April and August 2010.
      Pre-treatment venous blood was washed and cultured ex vivo to increase the
      proportion of schizont-infected erythrocytes. Cultured blood was seeded into
      Petri dishes with triplicate areas coated with ICAM-1, VCAM and CD36. Following
      incubation at 37 degrees C for one hour the dishes were washed and the number of 
      infected erythrocytes bound/mm2 to PBS control areas and to recombinant human
      ICAM-1 VCAM and CD36 coated areas were recorded. Each assay was performed in
      duplicate. Assay performance was monitored with the Plasmodium falciparum clone
      HB3. RESULTS: Blood samples were cultured ex vivo for up to 14.5 h (mean 11.3 +/-
      1.9 h) to increase the relative proportion of mature trophozoite and
      schizont-infected red blood cells to at least 50% (mean 65.8 +/- 17.51%). Three
      (60%) isolates bound significantly to ICAM-1 and VCAM, one (20%) isolate bound to
      VCAM and none of the five bound significantly to CD36. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium
      knowlesi infected erythrocytes from human subjects bind in a specific but
      variable manner to the inducible endothelial receptors ICAM-1 and VCAM. Binding
      to the constitutively-expressed endothelial receptor CD36 was not detected.
      Further work will be required to define the pathological consequences of these
      interactions.

TI  - Defining Plasmodium falciparum treatment in South West Asia: a randomized trial
      comparing artesunate or primaquine combined with chloroquine or SP.
PG  - e28957
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0028957 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimalarial resistance has led to a global policy of
      artemisinin-based combination therapy. Despite growing resistance chloroquine
      (CQ) remained until recently the official first-line treatment for falciparum
      malaria in Pakistan, with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) second-line.
      Co-treatment with the gametocytocidal primaquine (PQ) is recommended for
      transmission control in South Asia. The relative effect of artesunate (AS) or
      primaquine, as partner drugs, on clinical outcomes and gametocyte carriage in
      this setting were unknown. METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized trial among
      Afghan refugees in Pakistan compared six treatment arms: CQ; CQ+(single-dose)PQ; 
      CQ+(3 d)AS; SP; SP+(single-dose)PQ, and SP+(3 d)AS. The objectives were to
      compare treatment failure rates and effect on gametocyte carriage, of CQ or SP
      monotherapy against the respective combinations (PQ or AS). Outcomes included
      trophozoite and gametocyte clearance (read by light microscopy), and clinical and
      parasitological failure. FINDINGS: A total of 308 (87%) patients completed the
      trial. Failure rates by day 28 were: CQ 55/68 (81%); CQ+AS 19/67 (28%), SP 4/41
      (9.8%), SP+AS 1/41 (2.4%). The addition of PQ to CQ or SP did not affect failure 
      rates (CQ+PQ 49/67 (73%) failed; SP+PQ 5/33 (16%) failed). AS was superior to PQ 
      at clearing gametocytes; gametocytes were seen on d7 in 85% of CQ, 40% of CQ+PQ, 
      21% of CQ+AS, 91% of SP, 76% of SP+PQ and 23% of SP+AS treated patients. PQ was
      more effective at clearing older gametocyte infections whereas AS was more
      effective at preventing emergence of mature gametocytes, except in cases that
      recrudesced. CONCLUSIONS: CQ is no longer appropriate by itself or in
      combination. These findings influenced the replacement of CQ with SP+AS for
      first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the WHO Eastern
      Mediterranean Region. The threat of SP resistance remains as SP monotherapy is
      still common. Three day AS was superior to single-dose PQ for reducing gametocyte
      carriage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00959517.

TI  - Different patterns of pfcrt and pfmdr1 polymorphisms in P. falciparum isolates
      from Nigeria and Brazil: the potential role of antimalarial drug selection
      pressure.
PG  - 211-3
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0368 [doi]
AB  - The effect of antimalarial drug selection on pfcrt and pfmdr1 polymorphisms in
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates from two distinct geographical locations was
      determined in 70 and 18 P. falciparum isolates from Nigeria and Brazil,
      respectively, using nested polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing
      approaches. All isolates from Brazil and 72% from Nigeria harbored the mutant
      SVMNT and CVIET pfcrt haplotype, respectively. The pfcrt CVMNT haplotype was also
      observed in (7%) of the Nigerian samples. One hundred percent (100%) and 54% of
      the parasites from Brazil and Nigeria, respectively, harbored wild-type
      pfmdr1Asn86. We provide first evidence of emergence of the CVMNT haplotype in
      West Africa. The high prevalence of pfcrt CVIET and SVMNT haplotypes in Nigeria
      and Brazil, respectively, is indicative of different selective pressure by
      chloroquine and amodiaquine. Continuous monitoring of pfcrt SVMNT haplotype is
      required in endemic areas of Africa, where artesunate-amodiaquine combination is 
      used for treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria.

      histidine-rich repeat region of the hrp2 gene.
PG  - 194-8
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.10-0665 [doi]
AB  - We identified 480 persons with positive thick smears for asexual Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites, of whom 454 had positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for 
      the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) product of the hrp2 gene and 26 had negative 
      tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the histidine-rich
      repeat region of that gene was negative in one-half (10/22) of false-negative
      specimens available, consistent with spontaneous deletion. False-negative RDTs
      were found only in persons with asymptomatic infections, and multiplicities of
      infection (MOIs) were lower in persons with false-negative RDTs (both P < 0.001).
      These results show that parasites that fail to produce HRP2 can cause patent
      bloodstream infections and false-negative RDT results. The importance of these
      observations is likely to increase as malaria control improves, because lower
      MOIs are associated with false-negative RDTs and false-negative RDTs are more
      frequent in persons with asymptomatic infections. These findings suggest that the
      use of HRP2-based RDTs should be reconsidered.

AB  - PCR amplification coupled with pyrosequencing was used to measure molecular
      markers that could be used to detect and differentiate Plasmodium falciparum and 
      Plasmodium vivax in human blood samples. The detection rates were in agreement
      with the results of Giemsa-stained film microscopy, which is the current gold
      standard for detection. This method provides an exciting alternative for malaria 
      diagnosis.

TI  - High prevalence of pfcrt K76t mutants among Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
      Sabah, Malaysia.
PG  - 1322-6
AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) remains the first line drug for the prevention and treatment of 
      malaria in Malaysia in spite of the fact that resistance to CQ has been observed 
      in Malaysia since the 1960s. CQ-resistance is associated with various mutations
      in pfcrt, which encodes a putative transporter located in the digestive vacuolar 
      membrane of P. falciparum. Substitution of lysine (K) to threonine (T) at amino
      acid 76 (K76T) in pfcrt is the primary genetic marker conferring resistance to
      CQ. To determine the presence of T76 mutation in pfcrt from selected areas of
      Kalabakan, Malaysia 619 blood samples were screened for P. falciparum, out of
      which 31 were positive. Blood samples were collected on 3 MM Whatman filter
      papers and DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA mini kit. RFLP-PCR for the detection
      of the CQ-resistant T76 and sensitive K76 genotype was carried out. Twenty-five
      samples were shown to have the point mutation in pfcrt whereas the remaining
      samples were classified as CQ-sensitive (wild-type). In view of the fact that CQ 
      is the first line anti-malarial drug in Malaysia, this finding could be an
      important indication that treatment with CQ may no longer be effective in the
      future.

TI  - Molecular screening of Plasmodium infections among migrant workers in Thailand.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: A cross - sectional study was conducted to determine the 
      prevalence of Plasmodium infections among migrant workers in Thailand. METHODS: A
      total of 241 migrants at Kanchanaburi, Pathumthani and Nakornpathom provinces of 
      Thailand were recruited in our surveillance. Blood samples were examined for
      human malaria parasites by using microscopy and semi - nested multiplex PCR (SnM-
      PCR). RESULTS: Laboratory diagnosis revealed 6.2% total positive rate. As
      compared to microscopy (26.7%), SnM- PCR was more sensitive (93.3%) for malaria. 
      Plasmodium falciparum was predominant than P. vivax (53% : 40%, respectively).
      The majority of positive cases were from Myanmar workers who had low parasitaemia
      and without symptoms. The highest prevalence (13.7%) was found among migrant
      workers from Kanchanaburi province in western Thailand. CONCLUSION: These
      findings indicate risk of malaria transmission from migrant workers. Malaria
      surveillance should be included in the health- screening program for migrants in 
      Thailand to manage this health risk.

TI  - Lack of significant influence for FcgammaRIIa-RH131 or hemoglobin AA/AS
      polymorphisms on immunity and susceptibility to uncomplicated malaria and
      existence of marked linkage between the two polymorphisms in Daraweesh.
PG  - 537-44
LID - 10.1016/j.micinf.2012.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Malaria signature on human genome is marked by several gene polymorphisms.
      HemoglobinAS (HbAS) is known to protect against severe malaria, but barely proved
      to protect against uncomplicated malaria (UM). Similarly, the influence of
      FcgammaRIIa-RH131 polymorphism on malaria is controversial. Polymorphisms in both
      genes were examined and levels of IgG subclasses against four malaria antigens
      were measured for 250 Fulani's from Daraweesh, eastern Sudan. Morbidity data for 
      up to nine years was available for 214 donors. Number of malaria episodes
      experienced by each individual during the study period was used as indicator for 
      susceptibility to UM. PCR and RFLP were used for donors DNA genotyping and ELISA 
      for antibodies measurement. Results revealed that neither FcgammaRIIa-RH131
      alleles/genotypes nor HbAA/AS was significantly associated with malaria morbidity
      or with levels of IgG to test antigens. Both polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg
      Equilibrium, interestingly, there was strong association between the two
      polymorphisms (linkage disequilibrium - LD) with D' = 0.89. The association
      between the two polymorphisms was confirmed by analysis of independent material
      from a neighboring village. In conclusion, in Daraweesh both FcgammaRIIa-RH131
      and HbAA/AS genotypes, independently or together, were not major markers for UM
      susceptibility, however, marked LD was observed between the two polymorphisms.

LID - 10.1016/j.molbiopara.2011.12.009 [doi]
AB  - PfSUB3 is the third subtilisin-like protease annotated in Plasmodium genome
      database "PlasmoDB". The other two members, PfSUB1 and PfSUB2 have been
      implicated in merozoite egress and invasion in asexual blood stages. In this
      study, we recombinantly expressed a region of PfSUB3 spanning from Asn(334) to
      Glu(769) (PfSUB3c) which encompassed the predicted catalytic domain with all the 
      active site residues and predicted mature region spanning from Thr(516) to
      Glu(769) (PfSUB3m) in E. coli. PfSUB3m showed PMSF-sensitive proteolytic activity
      in in vitro assays. Replacement of active site serine with alanine in PfSUB3m
      resulted in inactive protein. We found that PfSUB3c and PfSUB3m undergo
      truncation to produce a 25-kDa species which was sufficient for proteolytic
      activity. Quantitative real-time PCR, immnufluorescence assay and Western blot
      analyses revealed that PfSUB3 is expressed at late asexual blood stages. Serine
      protease activity of PfSUB3 and its expression in the late stages of erythrocytic
      schizogony are indicative of some possible role of the protease in merozoite
      egress and/or invasion processes.

      exon 2 haplotypes in the Pacific from 1959 to 1979.
PG  - e30213
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030213 [doi]
AB  - Nearly one million deaths are attributed to malaria every year. Recent reports of
      multi-drug treatment failure of falciparum malaria underscore the need to
      understand the molecular basis of drug resistance. Multiple mutations in the
      Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) are involved in 
      chloroquine resistance, but the evolution of complex haplotypes is not yet well
      understood. Using over 4,500 archival human serum specimens collected from 19
      Pacific populations between 1959 and 1979, the period including and just prior to
      the appearance of chloroquine treatment failure in the Pacific, we PCR-amplified 
      and sequenced a portion of the pfcrt exon 2 from 771 P. falciparum-infected
      individuals to explore the spatial and temporal variation in falciparum malaria
      prevalence and the evolution of chloroquine resistance. In the Pacific, the
      prevalence of P. falciparum varied considerably across ecological zones. On the
      island of New Guinea, the decreases in prevalence of P. falciparum in coastal,
      high-transmission areas over time were contrasted by the increase in prevalence
      during the same period in the highlands, where transmission was intermittent. We 
      found 78 unique pfcrt haplotypes consisting of 34 amino acid substitutions and 28
      synonymous mutations. More importantly, two pfcrt mutations (N75D and K76T)
      implicated in chloroquine resistance were present in parasites from New Hebrides 
      (now Vanuatu) eight years before the first report of treatment failure. Our
      results also revealed unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity in pfcrt exon
      2 prior to the historical chloroquine resistance selective sweep, particularly in
      areas where disease burden was relatively low. In the Pacific, parasite genetic
      isolation, as well as host acquired immune status and genetic resistance to
      malaria, were important contributors to the evolution of chloroquine resistance
      in P. falciparum.

TI  - FcgammaRIIa polymorphism and anti-malaria-specific IgG and IgG subclass responses
      in populations differing in susceptibility to malaria in Burkina Faso.
PG  - 606-13
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2012.02690.x [doi]
AB  - FcgammaRIIa is known to be polymorphic; and certain variants are associated with 
      different susceptibilities to malaria. Studies involving the Fulani ethnic group 
      reported an ethnic difference in FcgammaRIIa-R131H genotype frequencies between
      the Fulani and other sympatric groups. No previous studies have addressed these
      questions in Burkina Faso. This study aimed to assess the influence of
      FcgammaRIIa-R131H polymorphism on anti-falciparum malaria IgG and IgG subclass
      responses in the Fulani and the Mossi ethnic groups living in Burkina Faso.
      Healthy adults more than 20 years old belonging to the Mossi or the Fulani ethnic
      groups were enrolled for the assessment of selected parasitological,
      immunological and genetic variables in relation to their susceptibility to
      malaria. The prevalence of the Plasmodium falciparum infection frequency was
      relatively low in the Fulani ethnic group compared to the Mossi ethnic group. For
      all tested antigens, the Fulani had higher antibody levels than the Mossi group. 
      In both ethnic groups, a similar distribution of FcgammaRIIa R131H polymorphism
      was found. Individuals with the R allele of FcgammaRIIa had higher antibody
      levels than those with the H allele. This study confirmed that malaria infection 
      affected less the Fulani group than the Mossi group. FcgammaRIIa-R131H allele
      distribution is similar in both ethnic groups, and higher antibody levels are
      associated with the FcgammaRIIa R allele compared to the H allele.

TI  - Development of a TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay for detection of single
      nucleotides polymorphisms associated with anti-malarial drug resistance.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance poses a threat to current global
      efforts towards control and elimination of malaria. Several methods are used in
      monitoring anti-malarial drug resistance. Molecular markers such as single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for example are increasingly being used to identify
      genetic mutations related to anti-malarial drug resistance. Several methods are
      currently being used in analysis of SNP associated with anti-malarial drug
      resistance and although each one of these methods has unique strengths and
      shortcoming, there is still need to improve and/or develop new methods that will 
      close the gap found in the current methods. METHODS: TaqMan Allelic
      Discrimination assays for detection of SNPs associated with anti-malarial drug
      resistance were designed for analysis on Applied Biosystems PCR platform. These
      assays were designed by submitting SNP sequences associated with anti-malarial
      drug resistance to Applied Biosystems website. Eleven SNPs associated with
      resistance to anti-malarial drugs were selected and tested. The performance of
      each SNP assay was tested by creating plasmid DNAs carrying codons of interests
      and analysing them for analysis. To test the sensitivity and specificity of each 
      SNP assay, 12 clinical samples were sequenced at codons of interest and used in
      the analysis. Plasmid DNAs were used to establish the Limit of Detection (LoD)
      for each assay. RESULTS: Data from genetic profiles of the Plasmodium falciparum 
      laboratory strains and sequence data from 12 clinical samples was used as the
      reference method with which the performance of the SNP assays were compared to.
      The sensitivity and specificity of each SNP assay was establish at 100%. LoD for 
      each assay was established at 2 GE, equivalent to less than 1 parasite/muL. SNP
      assays performed well in detecting mixed infection and analysis of clinical
      samples. CONCLUSION: TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay provides a good
      alternative tool in detection of SNPs associated with anti-malarial drug.

AB  - Genetic manipulation of malaria parasites remains an inefficient, time-consuming 
      and resource-intensive process. Presented here is a set of methods for 96-well
      plate-based transfection and culture that improve the efficiency of genetic
      manipulation of Plasmodium falciparum. Compared to standard protocols plate-based
      transfection requires 20-fold less DNA, transient transfection efficiency
      achieved is approximately seven-fold higher, whilst stable transfection success
      rate is above 90%. Furthermore the utility of this set of protocols to generate a
      knockout of the PfRH3 pseudogene, screened by whole-cell PCR, is demonstrated.
      The methods and tools presented here will facilitate genome-scale genetic
      manipulation of P. falciparum.

TI  - Surveillance for malaria elimination in Swaziland: a national cross-sectional
      study using pooled PCR and serology.
PG  - e29550
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To guide malaria elimination efforts in Swaziland and other
      countries, accurate assessments of transmission are critical. Pooled-PCR has
      potential to efficiently improve sensitivity to detect infections; serology may
      clarify temporal and spatial trends in exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Using a stratified two-stage cluster, cross-sectional design, subjects were
      recruited from the malaria endemic region of Swaziland. Blood was collected for
      rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), pooled PCR, and ELISA detecting antibodies to
      Plasmodium falciparum surface antigens. Of 4330 participants tested, three were
      RDT-positive yet false positives by PCR. Pooled PCR led to the identification of 
      one P. falciparum and one P. malariae infection among RDT-negative participants. 
      The P. falciparum-infected participant reported recent travel to Mozambique.
      Compared to performing individual testing on thousands of samples, PCR pooling
      reduced labor and consumable costs by 95.5%. Seropositivity was associated with
      age >/=20 years (11.7% vs 1.9%, P<0.001), recent travel to Mozambique (OR 4.4
      [95% CI 1.0-19.0]) and residence in southeast Swaziland (RR 3.78, P<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malaria infection and recent exposure in Swaziland
      are extremely low, suggesting elimination is feasible. Future efforts should
      address imported malaria and target remaining foci of transmission. Pooled PCR
      and ELISA are valuable surveillance tools for guiding elimination efforts.

TI  - Reduction of antimalarial antibodies by HIV infection is associated with
      increased risk of Plasmodium falciparum cord blood infection.
PG  - 568-77
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnancy can lead to congenital
      malaria, which has detrimental health consequences for infants. Human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) might increase cord blood P. falciparum infection by
      decreasing maternal antimalarial-specific antibodies. METHODS: HIV-negative
      (n=133) and HIV-positive (n=55) Mozambican pregnant women were assessed at
      delivery for maternal and cord P. falciparum infection by quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (qPCR) and P. falciparum-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Prevalence of qPCR-detected cord
      blood infection was 8.0%. Risk of cord infection was increased in presence of HIV
      (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.80; P=.04) and placental malaria (AOR, 22.08;
      P=.002) after adjusting for clinical variables. The odds of having a high
      immunoglobulin G response to chondrotin sulphate A-binding infected erythrocytes,
      parasite lysate, and erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 were reduced among
      HIV-positive women (P < .001, .048, and .056, respectively) and among women with 
      cord P. falciparum infection (P = .009, .04, and .046, respectively). In
      multivariate analysis including maternal HIV status, placental malaria, and
      antibody responses, HIV was no longer associated with cord blood infection (P =
      .11). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-associated impairment of antibody responses in pregnant
      women may contribute to a higher transmission of P. falciparum to their infants.

TI  - Mutant pfcrt "SVMNT" haplotype and wild type pfmdr1 "N86" are endemic in
      Plasmodium vivax dominated areas of India under high chloroquine exposure.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chloroquine resistance (CQR) phenotype in Plasmodium falciparum is
      associated with mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr-1 genes. Mutations at amino acid
      position 72-76 of pfcrt gene, here defined as pfcrt haplotype are associated with
      the geographic origin of chloroquine resistant parasite. Here, mutations at 72-76
      and codon 220 of pfcrt gene and N86Y pfmdr-1 mutation were studied in blood
      samples collected across 11 field sites, inclusive of high and low P. falciparum 
      prevalent areas in India. Any probable correlation between these mutations and
      clinical outcome of CQ treatment was also investigated. METHODS: Finger pricked
      blood spotted on Whatman No.3 papers were collected from falciparum malaria
      patients of high and low P. falciparum prevalent areas. For pfcrt haplotype
      investigation, the parasite DNA was extracted from blood samples and used for PCR
      amplification, followed by partial sequencing of the pfcrt gene. For pfmdr-1 N86Y
      mutation, the PCR product was subjected to restriction digestion with AflIII
      endonuclease enzyme. RESULTS: In 240 P. falciparum isolates with reported in vivo
      CQ therapeutic efficacy, the analysis of mutations in pfcrt gene shows that
      mutant SVMNT-S (67.50%) and CVIET-S (23.75%) occurred irrespective of clinical
      outcome and wild type CVMNK-A (7.91%) occurred only in adequate clinical and
      parasitological response samples. Of 287 P. falciparum isolates, SVMNTS 192
      (66.89%) prevailed in all study sites and showed almost monomorphic existence
      (98.42% isolates) in low P. falciparum prevalent areas. However, CVIETS-S
      (19.51%) and CVMNK-A (11.84%) occurrence was limited to high P. falciparum
      prevalent areas. Investigation of pfmdr-1 N86Y mutation shows no correlation with
      clinical outcomes. The wild type N86 was prevalent in all the low P. falciparum
      prevalent areas (94.48%). However, mutant N86Y was comparably higher in numbers
      at the high P. falciparum prevalent areas (42.76%). CONCLUSIONS: The wild type
      pfcrt gene is linked to chloroquine sensitivity; however, presence of mutation
      cannot explain the therapeutic efficacy of CQ in the current scenario of
      chloroquine resistance. The monomorphic existence of mutant SVMNT haplotype,
      infer inbreeding and faster spread of CQR parasite in areas with higher P. vivax 
      prevalance and chloroquine exposure, whereas, diversity is maintained in pfcrt
      gene at high P. falciparum prevalent areas.

      and their relation to chromatin modification.
PG  - e29881
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029881 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of variant gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum is still only 
      partially understood. Regulation of var genes, the most studied gene family
      involved in antigenic variation, is orchestrated by a dynamic pattern of
      inherited chromatin states. Although recent evidence pointed to epigenetic
      regulation of transcribed and repressed rif loci, little is known about specific 
      on/off associated histone modifications of individual rif genes. To investigate
      the chromatin marks for transcribed and repressed rif loci, we cultivated
      parasites and evaluated the transcriptional status of chosen rif targets by
      qRT-PCR and performed ChIP assays using H3K9ac and H3K9me3 antibodies. We then
      monitored changes in the epigenetic patterns in parasites after several
      reinvasions and also evaluated the "poised" mark in trophozoites and schizonts of
      the same erythrocytic cycle by ChIP using H3K4me2 specific antibodies. Our
      results show that H3K9 is acetylated in transcribed rif loci and trimethylated or
      even unmodified in repressed rif loci. These transcriptional and epigenetic
      states are inherited after several reinvasions. The poised modification H3K4me2
      showed a tendency to be more present in loci in trophozoites that upon
      progression to schizonts strongly transcribe the respective locus. However, this 
      effect was not consistently observed for all monitored loci. While our data show 
      important similarities to var transcription-associated chromatin modifications,
      the observed swiftly occurring modifications at rif loci and the absence of H3K9 
      modification point to a different dynamic of recruitment of chromatin modifying
      enzymes.

AB  - Improved laboratory diagnosis is critical to reduce the burden of malaria in
      pregnancy. Peripheral blood smears appear less sensitive than Plasmodium
      falciparum histidine-rich protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for
      placental malaria infections in studies conducted at delivery. In this study, 81 
      women in Uganda in the second or third trimester of pregnancy were followed-up
      until delivery. At each visit, peripheral blood was tested by blood smear, RDT,
      and nested species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sensitivity and
      specificity of the tests was calculated with PCR, which detected 22 infections of
      P. falciparum, as the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of blood
      smears were 36.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.0-59.2%) and 99.6% (95% CI =
      97.7-100%), respectively. The corresponding values for RDT were 31.8% (95% CI =
      14.7-54.9%) and 100% (95% CI = 98.3-100%). The RDTs could replace blood smears
      for diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy by virtue of their relative ease of use.
      Field-based sensitive tests for malaria in pregnancy are urgently needed.

AB  - The safety of artemether-lumefantrine in patients with acute, uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria was investigated prospectively using the auditory
      brainstem response (ABR) and pure-tone thresholds. Secondary outcomes included
      polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates. Patients were randomly assigned
      in a 3:1:1 ratio to either artemether-lumefantrine (N = 159),
      atovaquone-proguanil (N = 53), or artesunate-mefloquine (N = 53). The null
      hypothesis (primary outcome), claiming that the percentage of patients with a
      baseline to Day-7 ABR Wave III latency increase of > 0.30 msec is >/= 15% after
      administration of artemether-lumefantrine, was rejected; 2.6% of patients (95%
      confidence interval: 0.7-6.6) exceeded 0.30 msec, i.e., significantly below 15%
      (P < 0.0001). A model-based analysis found no apparent relationship between drug 
      exposure and ABR change. In all three groups, average improvements (2-4 dB) in
      pure-tone thresholds were observed, and polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure 
      rates were > 95% to Day 42. The results support the continued safe and
      efficacious use of artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the var gene repertoire and characterise the chondroitin
      sulphate A (CSA)-binding activity of the Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains encoded
      by the var2csa gene of a Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolate in Hainan 
      Province, China. METHODS: The sequences of var DBL1 regions were PCR-amplified,
      sequenced and the sequence characteristics was bioinformatically analysed.
      Recombinant proteins encoded by the var2csa genes were expressed and purified.
      The binding activities of the recombinant proteins to CSA receptor was detected
      by ELISA assays. RESULTS: Fifty six unique DBL alpha sequences were obtained, and
      the sequences represented similar diversity to the var genes of the genome
      parasite 3D7. There are two var2csa genes in the P. falciparum isolated from
      Hainan Province. Unlike in other falciparum parasites such as HB3, the two
      var2csa genes are more diverged. The receptor-binding capacity of DBL-5epsilon
      and DBL-6epsilon domains of HN var2CSA was studied. CONCLUSIONS: This work
      represented the diversity of var genes of a P. falciparum isolate in China.

      quinine sensitivity in Thai isolates of Plasmodium falciparum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to most currently
      used anti-malarial drugs is a major problem in malaria control along the
      Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodia borders. Quinine (QN) with
      tetracycline/doxycycline has been used as the second-line treatment for
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria. In addition, QN monotherapy has been the
      first-line treatment for falciparum malaria in pregnant women. However, reduced
      in vitro and in vivo responses to QN have been reported. To date, a few genetic
      markers for QN resistance have been proposed including Plasmodium falciparum
      chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 
      (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger (pfnhe-1). This study was to
      investigate the role of the pfmdr1 and pfnhe-1 gene on in vitro QN sensitivity in
      Thai isolates of P. falciparum. METHODS: Eighty-five Thai isolates of P.
      falciparum from the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodia borders from 2003-2008 were
      determined for in vitro QN sensitivity using radioisotopic assay. Polymorphisms
      of the pfmdr1 and pfnhe-1 gene were determined by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis.
      Associations between the in vitro QN sensitivity and the polymorphisms of the
      pfmdr1 and pfnhe-1 gene were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean QN IC50 was 202.8 nM
      (range 25.7-654.4 nM). Only four isolates were QN resistant when the IC50 of >500
      nM was used as the cut-off point. Significant associations were found between the
      pfmdr1 mutations at codons N86Y and N1042D and in vitro QN sensitivity. However, 
      no associations with the number of DNNND, DDNNNDNHNDD, and NHNDNHNNDDD repeats in
      the microsatellite ms4760 of the pfnhe-1 gene were identified. CONCLUSION: Data
      from the present study put doubt regarding the pfnhe-1 gene as to whether it
      could be used as the suitable marker for QN resistance in Thailand. In contrast, 
      it confirms the influence of the pfmdr1 gene on in vitro QN sensitivity.

AB  - Nearly two-thirds of the proteins encoded by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite 
      that causes the most deadly form of malaria, are annotated as "hypothetical." The
      yeast two-hybrid assay, which requires no prior knowledge about the target
      protein, has great potential to provide functional information about these
      uncharacterized proteins. However, P. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens are
      hampered by the poor expression of P. falciparum genes in yeast. AU-rich
      sequences in nascent P. falciparum transcripts resemble the 3' end processing
      sites in yeast mRNAs, and are prematurely cleaved and polyadenylated. In most
      cases, these aberrant messages are degraded and yield no protein. To overcome
      this limitation, we have developed methods to extensively fragment P. falciparum 
      genes. Novel yeast two-hybrid vectors, in which auxotrophic markers are fused to 
      the 3' ends of the cloned inserts, are employed to identify those gene fragments 
      that are expressed in yeast. In this chapter, we provide detailed protocols for
      fragmenting P. falciparum genes, creating P. falciparum activation domain
      libraries, and performing P. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens. Though focused 
      on P. falciparum, the approaches described here are applicable to other organisms
      and are likely to be especially useful for those with AT-rich genomes, which are 
      also likely to be poorly expressed in yeast.

TI  - Features and prognosis of severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax and mixed Plasmodium species in Papua New Guinean children.
PG  - e29203
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality from severe pediatric falciparum malaria appears low in
      Oceania but Plasmodium vivax is increasingly recognized as a cause of
      complications and death. The features and prognosis of mixed Plasmodium species
      infections are poorly characterized. Detailed prospective studies that include
      accurate malaria diagnosis and detection of co-morbidities are lacking. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We followed 340 Papua New Guinean (PNG) children with PCR-confirmed
      severe malaria (77.1% P. falciparum, 7.9% P. vivax, 14.7% P. falciparum/vivax)
      hospitalized over a 3-year period. Bacterial cultures were performed to identify 
      co-incident sepsis. Clinical management was under national guidelines. Of 262
      children with severe falciparum malaria, 30.9%, 24.8% and 23.2% had impaired
      consciousness, severe anemia, and metabolic acidosis/hyperlactatemia,
      respectively. Two (0.8%) presented with hypoglycemia, seven (2.7%) were
      discharged with neurologic impairment, and one child died (0.4%). The 27 severe
      vivax malaria cases presented with similar phenotypic features to the falciparum 
      malaria cases but respiratory distress was five times more common (P=0.001); one 
      child died (3.7%). The 50 children with P. falciparum/vivax infections shared
      phenotypic features of mono-species infections, but were more likely to present
      in deep coma and had the highest mortality (8.0%; P=0.003 vs falciparum malaria).
      Overall, bacterial cultures were positive in only two non-fatal cases. 83.6% of
      the children had alpha-thalassemia trait and seven with coma/impaired
      consciousness had South Asian ovalocytosis (SAO). CONCLUSIONS: The low mortality 
      from severe falciparum malaria in PNG children may reflect protective genetic
      factors other than alpha-thalassemia trait/SAO, good nutrition, and/or infrequent
      co-incident sepsis. Severe vivax malaria had similar features but severe P.
      falciparum/vivax infections were associated with the most severe phenotype and
      worst prognosis.

AB  - Complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene polymorphisms that are associated with Knops
      blood group antigens may influence the binding of Plasmodium parasites to
      erythrocytes, thereby affecting susceptibility to malaria. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the genotype and allele and haplotype frequencies of
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Knops blood group antigens and examine 
      their association with susceptibility to malaria in an endemic area of Brazil.
      One hundred and twenty-six individuals from the Brazilian Amazon were studied.
      The CR1-genomic fragment was amplified by PCR and six SNPs and haplotypes were
      identified after DNA sequence analysis. Allele and haplotype frequencies revealed
      that the Kn(b) allele and H8 haplotype were possibly associated with
      susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum. The odds ratios were reasonably high,
      suggesting a potentially important association between two Knops blood antigens
      (Kn(b) and KAM(+)) that confer susceptibility to P. falciparum in individuals
      from the Brazilian Amazon.

LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a widespread zoonotic parasitic disease that occurs 
      in both animals and humans. Traditional molecular assays are often difficult to
      perform, especially for the early diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infections.
      Here, we established a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification targeting the
      529 bp repeat element (529 bp-LAMP) to detect T. gondii DNA in blood samples of
      experimental mice infected with tachyzoites of the RH strain. FINDINGS: The assay
      was performed with Bst DNA polymerase at 65 degrees C for 1 h. The detection
      limit of the 529 bp-LAMP assay was as low as 0.6 fg of T. gondii DNA. The
      sensitivity of this assay was 100 and 1000 fold higher than that of the LAMP
      targeting B1 gene (B1-LAMP) and nested PCR targeting 529 bp repeat element (529
      bp-nested PCR), respectively. The specificity of the 529 bp-LAMP assay was
      determined using the DNA samples of Trypanosoma evansi, Plasmodium falciparum,
      Paragonimus westermani, Schistosoma japonicum, Fasciola hepatica and
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis. No cross-reactivity with the DNA of any parasites
      was found. The assay was able to detect T. gondii DNA in all mouse blood samples 
      at one day post infection (dpi). CONCLUSIONS: We report the following findings:
      (i) The detection limit of the 529 bp-LAMP assay is 0.6 fg of T. gondii DNA; (ii)
      The assay does not involve any cross-reactivity with the DNA of other parasites; 
      (iii) This is the first report on the application of the LAMP assay for early
      diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in blood samples from experimentally infected mice.
      Due to its simplicity, sensitivity and cost-effectiveness for common use, we
      suggest that this assay should be used as an early diagnostic tool for health
      control of toxoplasmosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massively parallel sequencing technology is revolutionizing
      approaches to genomic and genetic research. Since its advent, the scale and
      efficiency of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has rapidly improved. In spite of 
      this success, sequencing genomes or genomic regions with extremely biased base
      composition is still a great challenge to the currently available NGS platforms. 
      The genomes of some important pathogenic organisms like Plasmodium falciparum
      (high AT content) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (high GC content) display
      extremes of base composition. The standard library preparation procedures that
      employ PCR amplification have been shown to cause uneven read coverage
      particularly across AT and GC rich regions, leading to problems in genome
      assembly and variation analyses. Alternative library-preparation approaches that 
      omit PCR amplification require large quantities of starting material and hence
      are not suitable for small amounts of DNA/RNA such as those from clinical
      isolates. We have developed and optimized library-preparation procedures suitable
      for low quantity starting material and tolerant to extremely high AT content
      sequences. RESULTS: We have used our optimized conditions in parallel with
      standard methods to prepare Illumina sequencing libraries from a non-clinical and
      a clinical isolate (containing ~53% host contamination). By analyzing and
      comparing the quality of sequence data generated, we show that our optimized
      conditions that involve a PCR additive (TMAC), produces amplified libraries with 
      improved coverage of extremely AT-rich regions and reduced bias toward GC neutral
      templates. CONCLUSION: We have developed a robust and optimized Next-Generation
      Sequencing library amplification method suitable for extremely AT-rich genomes.
      The new amplification conditions significantly reduce bias and retain the
      complexity of either extremes of base composition. This development will greatly 
      benefit sequencing clinical samples that often require amplification due to low
      mass of DNA starting material.

TI  - Interferon regulatory factor modulation underlies the bystander suppression of
      malaria antigen-driven IL-12 and IFN-gamma in filaria-malaria co-infection.
PG  - 641-50
LID - 10.1002/eji.201141991 [doi]
AB  - In areas where polyparasitism is highly prevalent, the impact of multiple
      parasites on the host response is underestimated. In particular, the presence of 
      helminth infection coincident with malaria profoundly alters the production of
      malaria-specific IFN-gamma, IL-12p70, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11,
      cytokines/chemokines known to be critical in mediating malaria-specific immunity.
      In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the suppression of
      malaria-specific cytokines/chemokines, we assessed the expression of
      malaria-specific IL-12Rbeta1, IL-12Rbeta2 and interferon regulatory factor
      (IRF)-1 in blood obtained from 18 filaria-infected (Fil(+)) and 17
      filaria-uninfected (Fil(-)) individuals in a filaria-malaria co-endemic region of
      Mali. We found that Fil(+) individuals had significantly lower RNA expression of 
      IRF-1 but not IL-12Rbeta1 or IL-12Rbeta2 in response to malaria antigen
      stimulation. We also measured the frequency of IL-12-producing DCs from these
      subjects and found that Fil(+) subjects had lower frequencies of IL-12(+) mDCs
      after malaria antigen stimulation than did the Fil(-) subjects. Modeling these
      data in vitro, we found that mDCs pre-exposed to live microfilariae not only
      produced significantly lower levels of CXCL-9, CXCL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40,
      IL-12p19 and CXCL-11 following stimulation with malaria antigen but also markedly
      downregulated the expression of IRF-1, IRF-2 and IRF-3 compared with
      microfilaria-unexposed mDCs. siRNA-inhibition of irf-1 in mDCs downregulated the 
      production of IL-12p70 through repression of IL-12p35. Our data demonstrate that 
      the modulation of IRFs seen in filarial (and presumably other tissue-invasive
      helminths) infection underlies the suppression of malaria-specific
      cytokines/chemokines that play a crucial role in immunity to malaria.

TI  - Identification of pyrimethamine- and chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum 
      in Africa between 1984 and 1998: genotyping of archive blood samples.
PG  - 388
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the geographical distribution of drug resistance of
      Plasmodium falciparum is important for the effective treatment of malaria. Drug
      resistance has previously been inferred mainly from records of clinical
      resistance. However, clinical resistance is not always consistent with the
      parasite's genetic resistance. Thus, molecular identification of the parasite's
      drug resistance is required. In Africa, clinical resistance to pyrimethamine
      (Pyr) and chloroquine (CQ) was evident before 1980 but few studies investigating 
      the genetic resistance to these drugs were conducted before the late 1990s. In
      this study, genotyping of genes involved in resistance to Pyr and CQ was
      performed using archive blood samples from Africa between 1984 and 1998. METHODS:
      Parasite DNA was extracted from P. falciparum-infected blood smears collected
      from travellers returning to Japan from Africa between 1984 and 1998. Genotypes
      of the dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) and CQ-resistance transporter gene
      (pfcrt) were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and
      sequencing. RESULTS: Genotyping of dhfr and pfcrt was successful in 59 and 80
      samples, respectively. One wild-type and seven mutant dhfr genotypes were
      identified. Three dhfr genotypes lacking the S108N mutation (NRSI, ICSI, IRSI;
      amino acids at positions 51, 59, 108, and 164 with mutations underlined) were
      highly prevalent before 1994 but reduced after 1995, accompanied by an increase
      in genotypes with the S108N mutation. The dhfr IRNI genotype was first identified
      in Nigeria in 1991 in the present samples, and its frequency gradually increased.
      However, two double mutants (ICNI and NRNI), the latter of which was exclusively 
      found in West Africa, were more frequent than the IRNI genotype. Only two pfcrt
      genotypes were found, the wild-type and a Southeast Asian type (CVIET; amino
      acids at positions 72-76 with mutations underlined). The CVIET genotype was
      already present as early as 1984 in Tanzania and Nigeria, and appeared throughout
      Africa between 1984 and 1998. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report the 
      molecular identification of Pyr- and CQ-resistant genotypes of P. falciparum in
      Africa before 1990. Genotyping of dhfr and pfcrt using archive samples has
      revealed new aspects of the evolutionary history of Pyr- and CQ-resistant
      parasites in Africa.

      area of unstable malaria transmission in Central Sudan.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/1746-1596-6-128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of placental malaria has been widely used as a standard
      indicator to characterize malaria infection in epidemiologic surveys. Placental
      malaria poses a greater diagnostic challenge, accurate and sensitive diagnostic
      tool for malaria infections in pregnancy is needed. METHODS: A cross sectional
      study was conducted at Medani Hospital, which serves catchment area which is
      characterized by unstable malaria transmission. One hundred and seven placentae
      were investigated for malaria infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      histology. RESULTS: out of 107 investigated placentae, 33 (30.8%) and 34 (31.8%) 
      were positive for malaria by histology (two (2%) and 31(29.0%) were acute and
      past infections, respectively) and PCR, respectively. Out of 33 positive by
      histology, 15 were positive by the PCR while 18 were negative. The sensitivity of
      the PCR was 45.5% (95% CI: 29.2%- 62.5%). Out of 74 which were negative by
      histology, 19 were positive by the PCR. This is translated in specificity of
      74.3% (95% CI: 63.5%- 83.3%). Of those tested positive by the PCR, 15 were
      positive by the histology, while 19 were negative. This is translated into a
      positive predictive value of 44.1% (95% CI: 28.3%- 61.0%). Of those 73 tested
      negative by the PCR, 55 were negative according to histology while 23 were
      positive. This is translated into a negative predictive value of 75.3% (95% CI:
      64.5%-84.2%). CONCLUSION: PCR had low sensitivity and specificity in comparison
      to placental histology, perhaps because the vast majority of the placental
      infections were past infections. Further research is needed.

      drug treatment in Tanzanian children with acute uncomplicated malaria.
PG  - 380
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore Plasmodium falciparum population dynamics
      during the early phase of anti-malarial drug treatment with artemisinin-based
      combination therapy in children with clinical malaria in a high transmission area
      in Africa. METHODS: A total of 50 children aged 1-10 years with acute
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania, were
      enrolled. Participants were hospitalized and received supervised standard
      treatment with artemether-lumefantrine according to body weight in six doses over
      3 days. Blood samples were collected 11 times, i.e. at time of diagnosis (-2 h)
      and 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h after initiation of treatment.
      Parasite population dynamics were assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-genotyping of merozoite surface protein (msp) 1 and 2. RESULTS:
      PCR-analyses from nine sequential blood samples collected after initiation of
      treatment identified 20 and 21 additional genotypes in 15/50 (30%) and 14/50
      (28%) children with msp1 and msp2, respectively, non-detectable in the
      pre-treatment samples (-2 and 0 h combined). Some 15/20 (75%) and 14/21 (67%) of 
      these genotypes were identified within 24 h, whereas 17/20 (85%) and 19/21 (90%) 
      within 48 h for msp1 and msp2, respectively. The genotype profile was diverse,
      and varied considerably over time both within and between patients, molecular
      markers and their respective families. CONCLUSION: PCR analyses from multiple
      blood samples collected during the early treatment phase revealed a complex
      picture of parasite sub-populations. This underlines the importance of
      interpreting PCR-outcomes with caution and suggests that the present use of
      PCR-adjustment from paired blood samples in anti-malarial drug trials may
      overestimate assessment of drug efficacy in high transmission areas in Africa.The
      study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT00336375.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Honduras, chloroquine and primaquine are recommended and still
      appear to be effective for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      vivax malaria. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of
      resistance associated genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum and P. vivax
      collected in Honduras. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients
      seeking medical attention at the Hospital Escuela in Tegucigalpa from 2004 to
      2006 as well as three regional hospitals, two health centres and one regional
      laboratory during 2009. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in P. falciparum
      chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1),
      dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes and 
      in P. vivax multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr1) and dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) 
      genes were detected using PCR based methods. RESULTS: Thirty seven P. falciparum 
      and 64 P. vivax samples were collected. All P. falciparum infections acquired in 
      Honduras carried pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps and pfdhfr alleles associated with
      chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine sensitivity only. One
      patient with parasites acquired on a Pacific Island had pfcrt 76 T and pfmdr1 86Y
      alleles. That patient and a patient infected in West Africa had pfdhfr 51I, 59 R 
      and 108 N alleles. Pvmdr1 976 F was found in 7/37 and two copies of pvmdr1 were
      found in 1/37 samples. Pvdhfr 57 L + 58 R was observed in 2/57 samples.
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that P. falciparum from Honduras remain
      sensitive to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. This suggests that
      chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine should be efficacious for treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, supporting current national treatment
      guidelines. However, genetic polymorphisms associated with chloroquine and
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tolerance were detected in local P. vivax and imported
      P. falciparum infections. Continuous monitoring of the prevalence of drug
      resistant/tolerant P. falciparum and P. vivax is therefore essential also in
      Honduras.

TI  - Genetic analysis of the merozoite surface protein-1 block 2 allelic types in
      Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates from Lao PDR.
PG  - 371
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MSP-1 is one of the potential malarial vaccine candidate antigens.
      However, extensive genetic polymorphism of this antigen in the field isolates of 
      Plasmodium falciparum represents a major hindrance for the development of an
      effective vaccine. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the prevalence and
      genetic polymorphisms of K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic types of msp-1 block 2 among 
      P. falciparum clinical isolates from Lao PDR. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum
      isolates were collected from 230 P. falciparum-infected blood samples from three 
      regions of Lao PDR. K1, MAD20 and RO33 were detected by nested PCR; SSCP was used
      for polymorphism screening. The nested PCR products of each K1, MAD20 and RO33
      allelic types that had different banding patterns by SSCP, were sequenced.
      RESULTS: The overall prevalence of K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic types in P.
      falciparum isolates from Lao PDR were 66.95%, 46.52% and 31.30%, respectively, of
      samples under study. Single infections with K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic types were
      27.83%, 11.74% and 5.22%, respectively; the remainders were multiple clonal
      infections. Neither parasite density nor age was related to MOI. Sequence
      analysis revealed that there were 11 different types of K1, eight different types
      of MAD20, and 7 different types of RO33. Most of them were regional specific,
      except type 1 of each allelic type was common found in 3 regions under study.
      CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism with diverse allele types was identified in
      msp-1 block 2 among P. falciparum clinical isolates in Lao PDR. A rather high
      level of multiple clonal infections was also observed but the multiplicity of
      infection was rather low as not exceed 2.0. This basic data are useful for
      treatment and malaria control program in Lao PDR.

TI  - Association of sub-microscopic malaria parasite carriage with transmission
      intensity in north-eastern Tanzania.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, individuals are frequently asymptomatic and
      may be undetected by conventional microscopy or newer, rapid diagnostic tests.
      Molecular techniques allow a more accurate assessment of this asymptomatic
      parasite burden, the extent of which is important for malaria control. This study
      examines the relative prevalence of sub-microscopic level parasite carriage and
      clonal complexity of infections (multiplicity of infection) over a range of
      endemicities in a region of north-eastern Tanzania where altitude is an
      established proxy of malaria transmission. The PCR prevalence was then compared
      against other measures of transmission intensity collected in the same area.
      METHODS: This study used 1,121 blood samples collected from a previously
      conducted cross-sectional malario-metric survey during the short rainy season in 
      2001 from 13 villages (three at < 600 m, four at 600-1,200 m and six at > 1,200 m
      in altitude above sea level). Samples were analysed by PCR for carriage of
      parasites and multiplicity of infection. These data were compared with other
      measures of transmission intensity collected from the same area. RESULTS:
      Parasite prevalence was 34.7% by PCR and 13.6% by microscopy; a 2.5-fold
      difference in line with other recent observations. This fold difference was
      relatively consistent at the different altitude bands despite a marked decrease
      in parasite prevalence with altitude: < 600 m 70.9 vs 28.6, 600-1,200 m 35.5 vs
      9.9, > 1,200 m 15.8 vs 5.9. The difference between parasite prevalence by PCR was
      3.2 in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years (34.5 vs 10.9) compared with 2.5 
      in those aged 1-5 (34.0 vs 13.5) though this was not statistically significant.
      Multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranged from 1.2 to 3.7 and was positively
      associated with parasite prevalence assessed by both PCR and microscopy. There
      was no association of MOI and age.Village level PCR parasite prevalence was
      strongly correlated with altitude, sero-conversion rate and predicted
      entomological inoculation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic, low density,
      multi-clone malaria infection was common in this study area. These infections are
      important as potential contributors to the infectious reservoir of parasites and 
      need to be identified by control programmes especially in this era where malaria 
      elimination is a focus. High throughput standardized PCR approaches are needed to
      identify individuals who are malaria carriers.

      infants and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria across different body 
      weight ranges.
PG  - 369
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy, including
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL), is currently recommended for the treatment of
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The objectives of the current
      analysis were to compare the efficacy and safety of AL across different body
      weight ranges in African children, and to examine the age and body weight
      relationship in this population. METHODS: Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic
      data from a randomized, investigator-blinded, multicentre trial of AL for
      treatment of acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in infants and children in
      Africa were analysed according to body weight group. RESULTS: The trial included 
      899 patients (intent-to-treat population 886). The modified intent-to-treat (ITT)
      population (n = 812) comprised 143 children 5 to < 10 kg, 334 children 10 to < 15
      kg, 277 children 15 to < 25 kg, and 58 children 25 to < 35 kg. The 28-day PCR
      cure rate, the primary endpoint, was comparable across all four body weight
      groups (97.2%, 98.9%, 97.8% and 98.3%, respectively). There were no clinically
      relevant differences in safety or tolerability between body weight groups. In the
      three AL body weight dosing groups (5 to < 15 kg, 15 to < 25 kg and 25 to < 35
      kg), 80% of patients were aged 10-50 months, 46-100 months and 90-147 months,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Efficacy of AL in uncomplicated falciparum malaria is
      similar across body weight dosing groups as currently recommended in the label
      with no clinically relevant differences in safety or tolerability. AL dosing
      based on body weight remains advisable.

TI  - Prevalence and distribution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variants 
      in Thai and Burmese populations in malaria endemic areas of Thailand.
PG  - 368
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: G6PD deficiency is common in malaria endemic regions and is estimated
      to affect more than 400 million people worldwide. Treatment of malaria patients
      with the anti-malarial drug primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines may be
      associated with potential haemolytic anaemia. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate the prevalence of G6PD variants in Thai population who resided in
      malaria endemic areas (western, northern, north-eastern, southern, eastern and
      central regions) of Thailand, as well as the Burmese population who resided in
      areas along the Thai-Myanmar border. METHODS: The ten common G6PD variants were
      investigated in dried blood spot samples collected from 317 Thai (84 males, 233
      females) and 183 Burmese (11 males, 172 females) populations residing in malaria 
      endemic areas of Thailand using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Four and seven G6PD
      variants were observed in samples collected from Burmese and Thai population,
      with prevalence of 6.6% (21/317) and 14.2% (26/183), respectively. Almost all
      (96.2%) of G6PD mutation samples collected from Burmese population carried G6PD
      Mahidol variant; only one sample (3.8%) carried G6PD Kaiping variant. For the
      Thai population, G6PD Mahidol (8/21: 38.1%) was the most common variant detected,
      followed by G6PD Viangchan (4/21: 19.0%), G6PD Chinese 4 (3/21: 14.3%), G6PD
      Canton (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Union (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Kaiping (1/21: 4.8%), and G6PD
      Gaohe (1/21: 4.8%). No G6PD Chinese 3, Chinese 5 and Coimbra variants were found.
      With this limited sample size, there appeared to be variation in G6PD mutation
      variants in samples obtained from Thai population in different regions
      particularly in the western region. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate difference in
      the prevalence and distribution of G6PD gene variants among the Thai and Burmese 
      populations in different malaria endemic areas. Dosage regimen of primaquine for 
      treatment of both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria may need to 
      be optimized, based on endemic areas with supporting data on G6PD variants.
      Larger sample size from different malaria endemic is required to obtain accurate 
      genetic mapping of G6PD variants in Burmese and Thai population residing in
      malaria endemic areas of Thailand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a public health problem in Malaysia especially in
      the interior parts of Peninsular Malaysia and the states of Sabah and Sarawak
      (East Malaysia). This is the first study on the genetic diversity and genotype
      multiplicity of Plasmodium falciparum in Malaysia. METHODS: Seventy-five P.
      falciparum isolates were genotyped by using nested-PCR of MSP-1 (block 2) and
      MSP-2 (block 3). RESULTS: MSP-1 and MSP-2 allelic families were identified in 65 
      blood samples. RO33 was the predominant MSP-1 allelic family identified in 80.0% 
      (52/65) of the samples while K1 family had the least frequency. Of the MSP-2
      allelic families, 3D7 showed higher frequency (76.0%) compared to FC27 (20.0%).
      The multiplicity of P. falciparum infection (MOI) was 1.37 and 1.20 for MSP-1 and
      MSP-2, respectively. A total of seven alleles were detected; of which three MSP-1
      allelic families (RO33, MAD20 and K1) were monomorphic in terms of size while
      MSP-2 alleles were polymorphic (two 3D7 and two FC27). Heterozygosity (HE) was
      0.57 and 0.55 for MSP-1 and MSP-2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed
      that the MOI of P. falciparum is low, reflected the low intensity of malaria
      transmission in Pahang, Malaysia; RO33 and 3D7 were the most predominant
      circulating allelic families. The findings showed that P. falciparum has low
      allelic diversity with a high frequency of alleles. As a result, antimalarial
      drug efficacy trials based on MSP genotyping should be carefully interpreted.

PG  - 979-83
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0071 [doi]
AB  - Tanzania implemented artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for
      uncomplicated malaria in November of 2006 because of resistance to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. AL remains highly efficacious, but widespread use may 
      soon facilitate emergence of artemisinin tolerance/resistance, which initially
      may be detected at the molecular level as temporal changes in the frequency of
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Pfmdr-1 gene associated with AL
      resistance. In Tanzania, 830 Plasmodium falciparum-positive samples collected
      between 2003 and 2010 were examined for SNPs of Pfmdr-1 at codons 86, 184, and
      1246. Both the N86 and 184F increased from 2006 to 2010 (logistic regression;
      N86: odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.35 [1.07-1.71], P = 0.01; 184F:
      odds ratio = 1.42 [1.07-1.88], P = 0.02), and no change was found for D1246 (odds
      ratio = 1.01 [0.80-1.28], P = 0.9). The observed changes may be because of
      introduction of AL, and if so, this finding gives cause for concern and argues
      for continued surveillance of these molecular markers.

TI  - Large differences in prevalence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 mutations between Mwanza,
      Tanzania and Iganga, Uganda-a reflection of differences in policies regarding
      withdrawal of chloroquine?
PG  - 148-51
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a major public health problem in the world and
      sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most affected areas. Efforts to control malaria 
      are highly affected by drug resistance to commonly used antimalarials. The
      introduction of artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) as a first line drug 
      seems to be a major step in treatment of uncomplicated malaria, though search for
      drugs to combine with artemisinins still continues. There have been reports on
      increased prevalence of the wild type markers Pfcrt 76K and Pfmdr1 86N in some
      African countries and ideas of using chloroquine (CQ) in intermittent presumptive
      treatment for adults (IPTa) is coming up. The common combination of artemether
      and lumefantrine even selects for parasites that are wild type at these
      positions. This study is comparing prevalence of mutation at these two positions 
      in two East African countries with ACT as their first line drug but following
      somewhat different drug policies regarding CQ. In Tanzania CQ was stopped in 2001
      but in Uganda CQ was retained in combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 
      and used in home based management of fever for some time. SP is still used in IPT
      for pregnant women. METHODS: Blood smears and dried blood spots on Whatman filter
      papers were collected from 100 patients with uncomplicated malaria in Mwanza,
      Tanzania and 100 patients from Iganga, Uganda. DNA was extracted from all samples
      using Tris EDTA method. PCR and RFLP were performed and sequencing done on Pfcrt 
      amplification products. RESULTS: The prevalence of K76T mutations at Pfcrt in
      samples from Mwanza, Tanzania was 40.5% (34/84) and 100% (100/100) in samples
      from Iganga, Uganda. Prevalence of N86Y mutations in Pfmdr1 was 16.9% (13/77) and
      77.7% (63/81) in samples from Mwanza and Iganga, respectively. The re-emergence
      of CQ sensitive isolates in Mwanza, Tanzania showed the haplotype CVMNK typical
      for wild type isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CQ resistant parasites in 
      Mwanza, Tanzania is low compared to the existing high level of resistant
      parasites in Iganga, Uganda. This could be an indication that CQ may become
      useful in the future in Tanzania. This study shows clearly that there is a
      difference in mutations at these positions in these two countries implementing
      similar but somewhat different drug policies. In Uganda the drug resistance has
      reached fixation while in Tanzania the prevalence is going down.

TI  - Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha mediates matrix metalloproteinase-9
      enhancement in human adherent monocytes fed with malarial pigment.
PG  - 925-30
LID - 10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60220-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha
      (MIP-1alpha) in the detrimental enhancement of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
      expression, release and activity induced by phagocytosis of malarial pigment
      (haemozoin, HZ) in human monocytes. METHODS: Human adherent monocytes were
      unfed/fed with native HZ for 2 h. After 24 hours, MIP-1alpha production was
      evaluated by ELISA in cell supernatants. Alternatively, HZ-unfed/fed monocytes
      were treated in presence/absence of anti-human MIP-1alpha blocking antibodies or 
      recombinant human MIP-1alpha for 15 h (RNA studies) or 24 h (protein studies);
      therefore, MMP-9 mRNA expression was evaluated in cell lysates by Real Time
      RT-PCR, whereas proMMP-9 and active MMP-9 protein release were measured in cell
      supernatants by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Phagocytosis of
      HZ by human monocytes increased production of MIP-1 alpha, mRNA expression of
      MMP-9 and protein release of proMMP-9 and active MMP-9. All the HZ-enhancing
      effects on MMP-9 were abrogated by anti-human MIP-1alpha blocking antibodies and 
      mimicked by recombinant human MIP-1alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The present work suggests 
      a role for MIP-1alpha in the HZ-dependent enhancement of MMP-9 expression,
      release and activity observed in human monocytes, highlighting new detrimental
      effects of HZ-triggered proinflammatory response by phagocytic cells in
      falciparum malaria.

TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status and severity of malarial anaemia in
      Nigerian children.
PG  - 792-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (Gd-)
      contributes to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa but recent data on
      the interaction between Gd- and malaria among children is scarce. We hypothesised
      that, being a haemolytic factor, Gd- makes severe malarial anaemia (SMA) more
      common and even more severe. METHODOLOGY: We selected 930 children aged 0.5-12
      years attending a reference hospital with microscopically proven falciparum
      malaria. G6PD and haemoglobin were typed by the fluorescent spot test and
      electrophoresis, respectively. Molecular typing by PCR and restriction enzyme
      digestion was also performed on 15% of randomly selected samples. Haematocrit
      (PCV) values, haemoglobin type, blood group, presence of sickle cell trait
      (HbAS), and parasite counts were compared between G6PD-normal and deficient
      children. RESULTS: Prevalence of Gd- was 16.4% and 8.1% among boys and girls with
      malaria, respectively. Mean PCV was 22.8% in deficient children compared with
      21.0% in normal children (p = 0.041). In boys, 2.7% of Gd- had PCV </= 10%, as
      compared to 13.6% in Gd+ (p = 0.005). Similarly, 21.3% of Gd- had PCV </= 15%
      compared with 39.4% in Gd+ (p = 0.003). No such difference was found among girls.
      Overall, HbAS was typed in 7.6% and was more common in Gd- (13.0%) than in Gd+
      (6.8%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.058). The
      mean parasite counts were significantly lower in Gd- (15477.5/microl) than in Gd+
      (19784.4/microl; p = 0.013), and it was independent from HbAS. CONCLUSION: Gd-
      males but not females were significantly less likely to develop severe malarial
      anaemia.

TI  - A new molecular approach for cidal vs static antimalarial determination by
      quantifying mRNA levels.
PG  - 171-7
LID - 10.1016/j.molbiopara.2011.11.003 [doi]
AB  - In order to maximise compliance, the future antimalarial treatment should ideally
      require just a single-dose administration. This, in turn, demands new fast-acting
      effective drugs. Currently, methods to measure the in vitro killing rate of
      antimalarials are based on parasite growth. We have developed and validated a
      method to determine and classify antimalarial agents based on their cidal or
      static activity following quantitative Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. The
      method described here is a fast, reliable and user-friendly technique with a
      medium throughput. Metabolic activity of the parasite is followed by measuring
      mRNA expression levels of several genes during 5 parasite life cycles. mRNA from 
      the parasite culture is then retrotranscribed to cDNA and quantified by RT-PCR.
      This new method provides a rapid and reproducible way to accurately measure the
      antimalarial activity of new compounds in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum.

PG  - e1-8
LID - 10.1182/blood-2011-08-370734 [doi]
AB  - Infection of erythrocytes with the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum,
      results in dramatic changes to the host cell structure and morphology. The
      predicted functional localization of the STEVOR proteins at the erythrocyte
      surface suggests that they may be involved in parasite-induced modifications of
      the erythrocyte membrane during parasite development. To address the biologic
      function of STEVOR proteins, we subjected a panel of stevor transgenic parasites 
      and wild-type clonal lines exhibiting different expression levels for stevor
      genes to functional assays exploring parasite-induced modifications of the
      erythrocyte membrane. Using this approach, we show that stevor expression impacts
      deformability of the erythrocyte membrane. This process may facilitate parasite
      sequestration in deep tissue vasculature.

TI  - A head-to-head comparison of four artemisinin-based combinations for treating
      uncomplicated malaria in African children: a randomized trial.
PG  - e1001119
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay for
      the management of uncomplicated malaria cases. However, up-to-date data able to
      assist sub-Saharan African countries formulating appropriate antimalarial drug
      policies are scarce. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 9 July 2007 and 19 June 2009, 
      a randomized, non-inferiority (10% difference threshold in efficacy at day 28)
      clinical trial was carried out at 12 sites in seven sub-Saharan African
      countries. Each site compared three of four ACTs, namely amodiaquine-artesunate
      (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or 
      chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CD+A). Overall, 4,116 children 6-59 mo old
      with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were treated (1,226 with AL,
      1,002 with ASAQ, 413 with CD+A, and 1,475 with DHAPQ), actively followed up until
      day 28, and then passively followed up for the next 6 mo. At day 28, for the
      PCR-adjusted efficacy, non-inferiority was established for three pair-wise
      comparisons: DHAPQ (97.3%) versus AL (95.5%) (odds ratio [OR]: 0.59, 95% CI:
      0.37-0.94); DHAPQ (97.6%) versus ASAQ (96.8%) (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.41-1.34), and 
      ASAQ (97.1%) versus AL (94.4%) (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92). For the
      PCR-unadjusted efficacy, AL was significantly less efficacious than DHAPQ (72.7% 
      versus 89.5%) (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34) and ASAQ (66.2% versus 80.4%) (OR:
      0.40, 95% CI: 0.30-0.53), while DHAPQ (92.2%) had higher efficacy than ASAQ
      (80.8%) but non-inferiority could not be excluded (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.26-0.48). 
      CD+A was significantly less efficacious than the other three treatments. Day 63
      results were similar to those observed at day 28. CONCLUSIONS: This large
      head-to-head comparison of most currently available ACTs in sub-Saharan Africa
      showed that AL, ASAQ, and DHAPQ had excellent efficacy, up to day 63
      post-treatment. The risk of recurrent infections was significantly lower for
      DHAPQ, followed by ASAQ and then AL, supporting the recent recommendation of
      considering DHAPQ as a valid option for the treatment of uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00393679; Pan

TI  - Molecular surveillance of drug-resistant Plasmodium vivax using pvdhfr, pvdhps
      and pvmdr1 markers in Nouakchott, Mauritania.
PG  - 367-74
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkr464 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax occur in Mauritania.
      Drug-resistant P. falciparum has been reported, but the drug-resistance status of
      P. vivax is unknown. The aims of the present study were to determine the
      prevalence of mutant pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvmdr1 genes and of pvmdr1 gene
      amplification in P. vivax isolates in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania,
      and to establish a baseline for molecular surveillance of drug-resistant P. vivax
      in the country. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, 439 febrile patients
      were screened for malaria in Nouakchott. The sequences of pvdhfr, pvdhps and
      pvmdr1 markers in 110 P. vivax isolates were determined by direct sequencing of
      PCR products. The pvmdr1 gene copy number was determined by real-time PCR.
      RESULTS: The majority of the isolates with a successful PCR amplification (76/86,
      88%) were characterized to be of the wild-type pvdhfr genotype, while the
      remaining 10 isolates carried the S58R and S117N double mutations. All isolates
      had the wild-type pvdhps genotype SAKAV. For pvmdr1, 75 of 103 (73%) had the
      wild-type Y976, and 28 (27%) carried the mutant F976. Most (98%) carried the
      mutant L1076 codon. Of 105 isolates, 102 (97%) had one copy and 3 (3%) had two
      copies of the pvmdr1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mutations associated
      with antifolate resistance is low in Mauritania. Further studies are required to 
      determine the roles of pvmdr1 mutations and gene amplification in conferring drug
      resistance. These data will serve as a baseline for further monitoring of
      drug-resistant malaria.

PG  - 175-80
LID - 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2011.09.013 [doi]
AB  - A new seminested polymerase chain reaction (sn-PCR)-based protocol was developed 
      and used to detect and identify Plasmodium species in 1226 whole-blood samples
      from patients (872 Italians and 354 foreigners) with at least 1 symptom
      compatible with clinical malaria. The results were compared with those obtained
      by microscopy: 187 samples were positive by microscopy for malaria parasites and 
      196 were positive by sn-PCR. When compared to microscopy, the sn-PCR detected
      different malaria parasite species in 11 cases. In 4 of 11 cases, the sn-PCR
      identified 1 additional malaria parasite species not observed microscopically,
      suggesting increased sensitivity. In 4 samples with levels of parasitemia too low
      for accurate identification of species by microscopy, the sn-PCR detected 2 P.
      falciparum, 1 P. ovale, and 1 P. falciparum plus P. ovale. Moreover, 9 negative
      samples by microscopy were positive by sn-PCR. Follow-up analysis demonstrated a 
      parasite clearance of P. falciparum DNA up to 3 days after the disappearance of
      parasitemia at microscopy. In conclusion, sn-PCR-based diagnosis of malaria
      appears to be a useful tool when the results of conventional techniques are
      negative in the presence of a syndrome consistent with malaria, yielding accurate
      species identification and consequential correct treatment.

AB  - We demonstrate a technique for purification of nucleic acids from malaria
      parasites infecting human erythrocytes using isotachophoresis (ITP). We release
      nucleic acids from malaria-infected erythrocytes by lysing with heat and
      proteinase K for 10 min and immediately, thereafter, load sample onto a capillary
      device. We study the effect of temperature on lysis efficiency. We also implement
      pressure-driven counterflow during ITP extraction to extend focusing time and
      increase nucleic acid yield. We show that the purified genomic DNA samples are
      compatible with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and demonstrate a clinically
      relevant limit of detection of 0.5 parasites per nanoliter using quantitative
      PCR.

TI  - Genetic diversity and genotype multiplicity of Plasmodium falciparum infections
      in symptomatic individuals in the maritime region of Togo.
PG  - 153-60
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2011.02913.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the genotype prevalence and the multiplicity of Plasmodium
      falciparum infections in the maritime region of Togo. METHODS: We enrolled 309
      symptomatic individuals aged from 6 months to 15 years from Be/Lome and Tsevie,
      two malaria endemic zones. The number and the proportions of merozoite surface
      proteins 1, 2 and 3 genotypes in patients were determined using capillary
      electrophoresis genotyping. We further investigated the possible association
      between transaminases and homocysteine, and the severity of the disease. RESULTS:
      Of the 309 samples genotyped, 210 tested positive to msp-1, 227 to msp-2 and 193 
      to msp-3. The nested PCR revealed 22 different alleles for the allelic family
      msp-1, 33 for msp-2 and 13 for msp-3. At each locus, the family distribution was 
      54.58% of K1, 25% of MAD20 and 20.42% of RO33 for msp-1, and 51.71% and 48.29% of
      FC27 and 3D7, respectively, for msp-2. For all these allelic variants, the
      distribution was associated with neither the severity of malaria nor the zone of 
      habitation. Pearson correlation coefficients between either the levels of
      homocysteine or the transaminase and the severity of the disease were very low.
      CONCLUSION: The severity of malaria was not associated with higher multiplicity
      of infections and did not appear restricted to particular genotypes. More
      comprehensive explorations including immunity, genetic factors, nutritional and
      sociologic status of the population could clarify the situation.

TI  - Malaria antifolate resistance with contrasting Plasmodium falciparum
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) polymorphisms in humans and Anopheles mosquitoes.
PG  - 18796-801
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1116162108 [doi]
AB  - Surveillance for drug-resistant parasites in human blood is a major effort in
      malaria control. Here we report contrasting antifolate resistance polymorphisms
      in Plasmodium falciparum when parasites in human blood were compared with
      parasites in Anopheles vector mosquitoes from sleeping huts in rural Zambia. DNA 
      encoding P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) was amplified by PCR 
      with allele-specific restriction enzyme digestions. Markedly prevalent
      pyrimethamine-resistant mutants were evident in human P. falciparum
      infections--S108N (>90%), with N51I, C59R, and 108N+51I+59R triple mutants
      (30-80%). This resistance level may be from selection pressure due to decades of 
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine use in the region. In contrast, cycloguanil-resistant
      mutants were detected in very low frequency in parasites from human blood
      samples-S108T (13%), with A16V and 108T+16V double mutants ( approximately 4%).
      Surprisingly, pyrimethamine-resistant mutants were of very low prevalence (2-12%)
      in the midguts of Anopheles arabiensis vector mosquitoes, but
      cycloguanil-resistant mutants were highly prevalent-S108T (90%), with A16V and
      the 108T+16V double mutant (49-57%). Structural analysis of the dihydrofolate
      reductase by in silico modeling revealed a key difference in the enzyme within
      the NADPH binding pocket, predicting the S108N enzyme to have reduced stability
      but the S108T enzyme to have increased stability. We conclude that P. falciparum 
      can bear highly host-specific drug-resistant polymorphisms, most likely
      reflecting different selective pressures found in humans and mosquitoes. Thus, it
      may be useful to sample both human and mosquito vector infections to accurately
      ascertain the epidemiological status of drug-resistant alleles.

TI  - CD36 c.1264 T>G null mutation impairs acquisition of IgG antibodies to Plasmodium

      Tanzanian children.
PG  - 355-60

AB  - Polymorphisms in genes that encode crucial signalling molecules have been
      proposed as factors that influence susceptibility to, and outcome of malaria. We 
      studied the role of a mutation, c.1264 T>G, that causes CD36 deficiency on IgG
      responses to MSP-1(1)(9) antigen and malaria incidence. Children were genotyped
      for the c.1264 T>G mutation at the beginning of the study using PCR-RFLP. IgG
      levels [optical density (OD) readings] and per cent seropositivity to MSP-1(1)(9)
      were determined at baseline by ELISA. Children were followed for 12 months for
      acquisition of anti-MSP-1(1)(9) IgG antibody and malaria incidence. We observed a
      significant increase in the production of anti-MSP-1(1)(9) IgG antibody in normal
      and heterozygous children during the 12 months of follow-up, but not in
      homozygous mutants. Normal children had a significantly lower malaria incidence
      rate compared to other genotypes (chi(2) = 115.59; P < 0.01). We conclude that
      the presence of the c.1264 T>G mutation that leads to CD36 deficiency is closely 
      associated with reduced IgG production and higher malaria incidence. It is most
      likely that deficiency of CD36 which is known to modulate dendritic cell function
      suppresses the production of protective IgG antibodies directed to Plasmodium
      falciparum MSP-1(1)(9) antigen, which predisposes to the acquisition of clinical 
      malaria in children.

AB  - Randomized trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria. Data from seven studies supported by Novartis (1996-2007), including 647
      adults (> 16 years of age, 83.3% completed the study) and 1,332 children (</= 16 
      years of age, 89.3% completed the study) with microscopically confirmed
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and treated with the recommended regimen of
      AL, were pooled. The 28-day polymerase chain reaction-corrected parasitologic
      cure rate (primary efficacy endpoint) was 97.1% (495 of 510) in adults and 97.3% 
      (792 of 814) in children (evaluable population). Gametocytemia prevalence after
      day was 4.2% (23 of 554) in adults and 0.9% (8 of 846) in children. No noteworthy
      safety signals were observed. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.4% of the
      adults and 1.3% of the children. This study is the largest data set to date
      assessing AL therapy for treatment of acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. 
      Artemether-lumefantrine showed high cure rates and rapid resolution of
      parasitemia, fever, and gametocytemia in adults and children, and showed an
      excellent safety and tolerability profile.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bikaner region is endemic for both P. vivax and P. falciparum
      malaria. Usually, cerebral malaria is caused by P. falciparum but it has been
      reported recently also in P. vivax mono-infection. Epidemiologic studies and
      clinical descriptions of P. vivax cerebral malaria in children are rare. AIMS: To
      describe the clinical features of PCR-confirmed cerebral malaria owing to P.
      vivax mono-infection and its clinico-laboratory profile in Bikaner, Northwest
      India. METHODS: This observational prospective study was based on detailed
      clinical and laboratory investigation of children admitted with cerebral malaria 
      owing to P. vivax between November 2008 and December 2010. Cerebral malaria was
      categorised according to the WHO (2000) criteria for P. falciparum and the
      diagnosis of P. vivax mono-infection was established by peripheral blood film and
      rapid diagnostic tests and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The
      possibility of other diseases/infections causing similar illness were
      investigated thoroughly. RESULTS: Thirteen children with P. vivax cerebral
      malaria were studied, eight of whom (61.5%) had multi-organ (two or more organs) 
      dysfunction. Other associated severe manifestations included severe anaemia (7), 
      hepatic dysfunction (2), renal dysfunction (2), bleeding manifestation (2),
      respiratory distress (2), metabolic acidosis (2) and shock (one). Hypoglycaemia
      was not observed in any patient. There was no evidence of neurological sequelae. 
      All the children were managed according to WHO guidelines using intravenous
      artisunate. Thrombocytopenia was detected in five and hyponatraemia in four
      children. CONCLUSION: P. vivax mono-infection can cause cerebral malaria and
      multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - Human herpes viruses (HHVs) are widely distributed pathogens. In immuno-competent
      individuals their clinical outcomes are generally benign but in
      immuno-compromised hosts, primary infection or extensive viral reactivation can
      lead to critical diseases. Plasmodium falciparum malaria profoundly affects the
      host immune system. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the direct effect
      of acute P. falciparum infection on reactivation and shedding of all known human 
      herpes viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8). We monitored
      their presence by real time PCR in plasma and saliva of Ugandan children with
      malaria at the day of admission to the hospital (day-0) and 14 days later (after 
      treatment), or in children with mild infections unrelated to malaria. For each
      child screened in this study, at least one type of HHV was detected in the
      saliva. HHV-7 and HHV-6 were detected in more than 70% of the samples and CMV in 
      approximately half. HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and HHV-8 were detected at lower frequency.
      During salivary shedding the highest mean viral load was observed for HSV-1
      followed by EBV, HHV-7, HHV-6, CMV and HHV-8. After anti-malarial treatment the
      salivary HSV-1 levels were profoundly diminished or totally cleared. Similarly,
      four children with malaria had high levels of circulating EBV at day-0, levels
      that were cleared after anti-malarial treatment confirming the association
      between P. falciparum infection and EBV reactivation. This study shows that acute
      P. falciparum infection can contribute to EBV reactivation in the blood and HSV-1
      reactivation in the oral cavity. Taken together our results call for further
      studies investigating the potential clinical implications of HHVs reactivation in
      children suffering from malaria.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis: rapid diagnostic tests versus placental
      histology, microscopy and PCR for malaria in pregnant women.
PG  - 321
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, malaria infection with Plasmodium falciparum or
      Plasmodium vivax is related to adverse maternal health and poor birth outcomes.
      Diagnosis of malaria, during pregnancy, is complicated by the absence or low
      parasite densities in peripheral blood. Diagnostic methods, other than
      microscopy, are needed for detection of placental malaria. Therefore, the
      diagnostic accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), detecting antigen, and
      molecular techniques (PCR), detecting DNA, for the diagnosis of Plasmodium
      infections in pregnancy was systematically reviewed. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and
      Web of Science were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of
      RDTs, PCR, microscopy of peripheral and placental blood and placental histology
      for the detection of malaria infection (all species) in pregnant women. RESULTS: 
      The results of 49 studies were analysed in metandi (Stata), of which the majority
      described P. falciparum infections. Although both placental and peripheral blood 
      microscopy cannot reliably replace histology as a reference standard for
      placental P. falciparum infection, many studies compared RDTs and PCR to these
      tests. The proportion of microscopy positives in placental blood (sensitivity)
      detected by peripheral blood microscopy, RDTs and PCR are respectively 72% [95%
      CI 62-80], 81% [95% CI 55-93] and 94% [95% CI 86-98]. The proportion of placental
      blood microscopy negative women that were negative in peripheral blood
      microscopy, RDTs and PCR (specificity) are 98% [95% CI 95-99], 94% [95% CI 76-99]
      and 77% [95% CI 71-82]. Based on the current data, it was not possible to
      determine if the false positives in RDTs and PCR are caused by sequestered
      parasites in the placenta that are not detected by placental microscopy.
      CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that RDTs and PCR may have good performance
      characteristics to serve as alternatives for the diagnosis of malaria in
      pregnancy, besides any other limitations and practical considerations concerning 
      the use of these tests. Nevertheless, more studies with placental histology as
      reference test are urgently required to reliably determine the accuracy of RDTs
      and PCR for the diagnosis of placental malaria. P. vivax-infections have been
      neglected in diagnostic test accuracy studies of malaria in pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria remains a major health problem in tropical
      and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Several rhoptry proteins which are important 
      for interaction with and/or invasion of red blood cells, such as PfRONs, Pf92,
      Pf38, Pf12 and Pf34, have been described during the last few years and are being 
      considered as potential anti-malarial vaccine candidates. This study describes
      the identification and characterization of the P. vivax rhoptry neck protein 1
      (PvRON1) and examine its antigenicity in natural P. vivax infections. METHODS:
      The PvRON1 encoding gene, which is homologous to that encoding the P. falciparum 
      apical sushi protein (ASP) according to the plasmoDB database, was selected as
      our study target. The pvron1 gene transcription was evaluated by RT-PCR using RNA
      obtained from the P. vivax VCG-1 strain. Two peptides derived from the deduced P.
      vivax Sal-I PvRON1 sequence were synthesized and inoculated in rabbits for
      obtaining anti-PvRON1 antibodies which were used to confirm the protein
      expression in VCG-1 strain schizonts along with its association with
      detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) by Western blot, and its localization by 
      immunofluorescence assays. The antigenicity of the PvRON1 protein was assessed
      using human sera from individuals previously exposed to P. vivax malaria by
      ELISA. RESULTS: In the P. vivax VCG-1 strain, RON1 is a 764 amino acid-long
      protein. In silico analysis has revealed that PvRON1 shares essential
      characteristics with different antigens involved in invasion, such as the
      presence of a secretory signal, a GPI-anchor sequence and a putative sushi
      domain. The PvRON1 protein is expressed in parasite's schizont stage, localized
      in rhoptry necks and it is associated with DRMs. Recombinant protein recognition 
      by human sera indicates that this antigen can trigger an immune response during a
      natural infection with P. vivax. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the identification
      and characterization of the P. vivax rhoptry neck protein 1 in the VCG-1 strain. 
      Taking into account that PvRON1 shares several important characteristics with
      other Plasmodium antigens that play a functional role during RBC invasion and, as
      shown here, it is antigenic, it could be considered as a good vaccine candidate. 
      Further studies aimed at assessing its immunogenicity and protection-inducing
      ability in the Aotus monkey model are thus recommended.

PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-4-204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a zoonotic parasite that causes
      eosinophilic meningitis in humans. The most common source of infection with A.
      cantonensis is the consumption of raw or undercooked mollusks (e.g., snails and
      slugs) harbouring infectious third-stage larvae (L3). However, the parasite is
      difficult to identify in snails. The purpose of this study was to develop a
      quick, simple molecular method to survey for A. cantonensis in intermediate host 
      snails. FINDINGS: We used a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, 
      which was performed using Bst DNA polymerase. Reactions amplified the A.
      cantonensis 18S rRNA gene and demonstrated high sensitivity; as little as 1 fg of
      DNA was detected in the samples. Furthermore, no cross-reactivity was found with 
      other parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Schistosoma
      japonicum, Clonorchis sinensis, Paragonimus westermani and Anisakis. Pomacea
      canaliculata snails were exposed to A. cantonensis first-stage larvae (L1) in the
      laboratory, and L3 were observed in the snails thirty-five days after infection. 
      All nine samples were positive as determined by the LAMP assay for A.
      cantonensis, which was identified as positive by using PCR and microscopy, this
      demonstrates that LAMP is sensitive and effective for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:
      LAMP is an appropriate diagnostic method for the routine identification of A.
      cantonensis within its intermediate host snail P. canaliculata because of its
      simplicity, sensitivity, and specificity. It holds great promise as a useful
      monitoring tool for A. cantonensis in endemic regions.

LID - 10.1074/mcp.M111.010645 [doi]
AB  - Differential expression of ligands in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
      falciparum enables it to recognize different receptors on the erythrocyte
      surface, thereby providing alternative invasion pathways. Switching of invasion
      from using sialated to nonsialated erythrocyte receptors has been linked to the
      transcriptional activation of a single parasite ligand. We have used quantitative
      proteomics to show that in addition to this single known change, there are a
      significant number of changes in the expression of merozoite proteins that are
      regulated independent of transcription during invasion pathway switching. These
      results demonstrate a so far unrecognized mechanism by which the malaria parasite
      is able to adapt to variations in the host cell environment by
      post-transcriptional regulation.

PG  - e25992
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0025992 [doi]
AB  - Antimalarial drug resistance is a major obstacle to malaria control and eventual 
      elimination. The routine surveillance for molecular marker of resistance is an
      efficient way to assess drug efficacy, which remains feasible in areas where
      malaria control interventions have succeeded in substantially reducing malaria
      transmission. Community based asexual parasite prevalence surveys were conducted 
      annually in sentinel sites in Gaza Province, Mozambique from 2006 until 2010,
      before, during and after antimalarial policy changes to artesunate plus
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in 2006 and to artemether-lumefantrine in 2008. Genetic
      analysis of dhfr, dhps, crt, and mdr1 resistant genes was conducted on 3 331
      (14.4%) Plasmodium falciparum PCR positive samples collected over the study
      period from 23 229 children aged 2 to 15 years. The quintuple dhfr/dhps mutation 
      associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance increased from 56.2% at
      baseline to 75.8% by 2010. At baseline the crt76T and mdr186Y mutants were
      approaching fixation, 96.1% and 74.7%, respectively. Following the deployment of 
      artemisinin-based combination therapy, prevalence of both these
      chloroquine-resistance markers began declining, reaching 32.4% and 30.9%,
      respectively, by 2010. All samples analysed over the 5-year period possessed a
      single copy of the mdr1 gene. The high and increasing prevalence of the quintuple
      mutation supports the change in drug policy from artesunate plus
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to artemether-lumefantrine in Mozambique. As
      chloroquine related drug pressure decreased in the region, so did the molecular
      markers associated with chloroquine resistance (crt76T and mdr186Y). However,
      this reversion to the wild-type mdr186N predisposes parasites towards developing 
      lumefantrine resistance. Close monitoring of artemether-lumefantrine efficacy is 
      therefore essential, particularly given the high drug pressure within the region 
      where most countries now use artemether-lumefantrine as first line treatment.

TI  - Molecular assessment of dhfr/dhps mutations among Plasmodium vivax clinical
      isolates after introduction of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in combination with
      artesunate in Iran.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.003 [doi]
AB  - The increasing use of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) for treatment of
      chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has resulted in increased exposure of
      Plasmodium vivax parasites in areas where both species co-exist. In this study,
      the extent of mutations/haplotypes in pvdhfr and pvdhps was examined using
      PCR-RFLP methods in 427 P. vivax isolates in Iran after 4 years of introducing SP
      as the first-line anti-malarial drug in Iran. Mutations were detected in three
      codons of pvdhfr (F57L, S58R and S117N) and in one of pvdhps (A383G) and the
      majority of isolates had double mutations (58R/117N, 45.4%). In addition, the
      frequency of 57L mutation was detected in 8.2% of P. vivax isolates. This
      frequency was significantly increased when compared with a similar study on P.
      vivax isolates in 2005 (X(2) test, P<0.0001). Moreover, there was an increase in 
      the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms at position 383G in pvdhps
      (0-2.6%) was found. Furthermore, the number of haplotypes increased from 6 to 12 
      in the study areas during 2006-2010. Interestingly, when combining the two loci, 
      the frequency of parasites carrying pvdhfr/pvdhps pure mutations
      (L(57)R(58)/G(383), R(58)N(117)/G(383)) increased from 0% in 2006 to 2.1% in
      2010. In conclusion, the present results suggest that SP could be effective in
      treatment against the erythrocytic stages of vivax malaria in Iran; however, the 
      increased frequency of mutant haplotypes in Iran since 2006 is worrying and
      indicates the emergence of drug-tolerant/resistant P. vivax isolates in Iran in
      near future.

AB  - Although malaria has become a serious public health problem in Mauritania since
      the late 1990s, few documented data on its epidemiology exist. The objective of
      this study was to assess the morbidity of clinical malaria among children in
      Nouakchott. Three hundred and one febrile children, consulting at three health
      facilities of Nouakchott, were screened for malaria in 2009 (n=216) and 2010
      (n=85). Plasmodium species identification and parasite density were determined by
      microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin and thick films and confirmed by
      rapid diagnostic test and nested PCR. Of 301 febrile children, 105 (34.9%) were
      malaria-positive by nested PCR and 87 (28.9%) by microscopy. Plasmodium vivax
      represented 97.1% (102/105) and P. falciparum accounted for 2.9% (3/105) of
      positive cases. All positive children under five years old were infected with P. 
      vivax. The highest numbers of malaria positives were found during or shortly
      after the rainy season and the lowest during the dry season. Fifty-four of 105
      (51.4%) malaria cases, all with P. vivax, had never travelled outside Nouakchott.
      Individuals belonging to the Moors ethnic group represented 97.0% of P. vivax
      cases. Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in
      Nouakchott and that P. vivax is the principal causative agent. Regular
      surveillance is required to monitor malaria prevalence and incidence, and further
      measures are needed to counter the possible spread of malaria in the country.

AB  - Introduction. Malaria is currently one of the most prevalent parasite-transmitted
      diseases caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Misidentification of human 
      malaria parasites especially P. knowlesi based on microscopic examination is very
      common. The objectives of this paper were to accurately identify the incidence of
      human malaria parasites in the interior division of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo,
      based on small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) and to determine the
      misidentification rate in human malaria parasites. Methods. Nested PCR was used
      to detect the presence of human malaria parasites. A total of 243 blood spot
      samples from patients who had requested for blood film for malaria parasite
      (BFMP) analyses were used in this study. Results. Nested PCR findings showed that
      there was no P. malariae infection while the highest prevalent malaria parasite
      was P. knowlesi, followed by P. vivax, P. falciparum, and mixed infection. Only
      69.5% of the 243 samples giving consistent nested PCR and microscopic results.
      Conclusion. The preliminary findings from molecular detection of malaria showed
      that P. knowlesi was the most prevalent Plasmodium species in the interior
      division of Sabah. The findings from this paper may provide a clearer picture on 
      the actual transmission of different Plasmodium species in this region.

TI  - Malaria diagnosis from pooled blood samples: comparative analysis of real-time
      PCR, nested PCR and immunoassay as a platform for the molecular and serological
      diagnosis of malaria on a large-scale.
PG  - 691-700
LID - S0074-02762011000600008 [pii]
AB  - Malaria diagnoses has traditionally been made using thick blood smears, but more 
      sensitive and faster techniques are required to process large numbers of samples 
      in clinical and epidemiological studies and in blood donor screening. Here, we
      evaluated molecular and serological tools to build a screening platform for
      pooled samples aimed at reducing both the time and the cost of these diagnoses.
      Positive and negative samples were analysed in individual and pooled experiments 
      using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR and an
      immunochromatographic test. For the individual tests, 46/49 samples were positive
      by real-time PCR, 46/49 were positive by nested PCR and 32/46 were positive by
      immunochromatographic test. For the assays performed using pooled samples, 13/15 
      samples were positive by real-time PCR and nested PCR and 11/15 were positive by 
      immunochromatographic test. These molecular methods demonstrated sensitivity and 
      specificity for both the individual and pooled samples. Due to the advantages of 
      the real-time PCR, such as the fast processing and the closed system, this method
      should be indicated as the first choice for use in large-scale diagnosis and the 
      nested PCR should be used for species differentiation. However, additional field 
      isolates should be tested to confirm the results achieved using cultured
      parasites and the serological test should only be adopted as a complementary
      method for malaria diagnosis.

TI  - Placental Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection: operational accuracy of HRP2
      rapid diagnostic tests in a malaria endemic setting.
PG  - 306
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria has a negative effect on the outcome of pregnancy. Pregnant
      women are at high risk of severe malaria and severe haemolytic anaemia, which
      contribute 60-70% of foetal and perinatal losses. Peripheral blood smear
      microscopy under-estimates sequestered placental infections, therefore malaria
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting histidine rich protein-2 antigen (HRP-2) 
      in peripheral blood are a potential alternative. METHODS: HRP-2 RDTs accuracy in 
      detecting malaria in pregnancy (MIP >28 weeks gestation) and placental Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria (after childbirth) were conducted using Giemsa microscopy and 
      placental histopathology respectively as the reference standard. The study was
      conducted in Mbale Hospital, using the midwives to perform and interpret the RDT 
      results. Discordant results samples were spot checked using PCR techniques.
      RESULTS: Among 433 febrile women tested, RDTs had a sensitivity of 96.8% (95% CI 
      92-98.8), specificity of 73.5% (95% CI 67.8-78.6), a positive predictive value
      (PPV) of 68.0% (95% CI 61.4-73.9), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.5%
      (95% CI 94.0-99.0) in detecting peripheral P. falciparum malaria during
      pregnancy. At delivery, in non-symptomatic women, RDTs had a 80.9% sensitivity
      (95% CI 57.4-93.7) and a 87.5% specificity (95%CI 80.9-92.1), PPV of 47.2% (95%
      CI 30.7-64.2) and NPV of 97.1% (95% CI 92.2-99.1) in detecting placental P.
      falciparum infections among 173 samples. At delivery, 41% of peripheral
      infections were detected by microscopy without concurrent placental infection.
      The combination of RDTs and microscopy improved the sensitivity to 90.5% and the 
      specificity to 98.4% for detecting placental malaria infection (McNemar's X(2)>
      3.84). RDTs were not superior to microscopy in detecting placental infection
      (McNemar's X(2)< 3.84). Presence of malaria in pregnancy and active placental
      malaria infection were 38% and 12% respectively. Placental infections were
      associated with poor pregnancy outcome [pre-term, still birth and low birth
      weight] (aOR = 37.9) and late pregnancy malaria infection (aOR = 20.9). Mosquito 
      net use (aOR 2.1) and increasing parity (aOR 2.7) were associated with lower risk
      for malaria in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Use of HRP-2 RDTs to detect malaria in
      pregnancy in symptomatic women was accurate when performed by midwives. A
      combination of RDTs and microscopy provided the best means of detecting placental
      malaria. RDTs were not superior to microscopy in detecting placental infection.
      With a high sensitivity and specificity, RDTs could be a useful tool for
      assessing malaria in pregnancy, with further (cost-) effectiveness studies.

TI  - A thirteen-year analysis of Plasmodium falciparum populations reveals high
      conservation of the mutant pfcrt haplotype despite the withdrawal of chloroquine 
      from national treatment guidelines in Gabon.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chloroquine resistance (CR) decreased after the removal of
      chloroquine from national treatment guidelines in Malawi, Kenia and Tanzania. In 
      this investigation the prevalence of the chloroquine resistance (CQR) conferring 
      mutant pfcrt allele and its associated chromosomal haplotype were determined
      before and after the change in Gabonese national treatment guidelines from
      chloroquine (CQ) to artesunate plus amodiaquine (AQ) in 2003. METHODS: The
      prevalence of the wild type pfcrt allele was assessed in 144 isolates from the
      years 2005 - 07 by PCR fragment restriction digest and direct sequencing. For
      haplotype analysis of the chromosomal regions flanking the pfcrt locus,
      microsatellite analysis was done on a total of 145 isolates obtained in 1995/96
      (43 isolates), 2002 (47 isolates) and 2005 - 07 (55 isolates). RESULTS: The
      prevalence of the mutant pfcrt allele decreased from 100% in the years 1995/96
      and 2002 to 97% in 2005 - 07. Haplotype analysis showed that in 1995/96 79% of
      the isolates carried the same microsatellite alleles in a chromosomal fragment
      spanning 39 kb surrounding the pfcrt locus. In 2002 and 2005 - 07 the prevalence 
      of this haplotype was 62% and 58%, respectively. Pfcrt haplotype analysis showed 
      that all wild type alleles were CVMNK. CONCLUSION: Four years after the
      withdrawal of CQ from national treatment guidelines the prevalence of the mutant 
      pfcrt allele remains at 97%. The data suggest that the combination of artesunate 
      plus AQ may result in continued selection for the mutant pfcrt haplotype even
      after discontinuance of CQ usage.

TI  - Molecular monitoring of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to antimalarial drugs
      after adoption of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate as the first line
      treatment in Iran.
PG  - 13-8

AB  - The main objective of this investigation was whether the combination therapy of
      sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate (AS) protects against the spread
      of resistance to SP in malaria-endemic south-eastern Iran. Infected blood samples
      of Plasmodium falciparum (n=170) were collected during 2008-2010 after the
      adoption of SP-AS as the first line treatment in Iran. Four different genes of P.
      falciparum [dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps), dihydrofolate reductase
      (pfdhfr), chloroquine (CQ) resistance transporter (pfcrt K76T) and multidrug
      resistance1 (pfmdr1 N86Y)], associated with SP and CQ resistance were analyzed
      using PCR-RFLP methods. The result showed 4.1, 95.9 and 100% prevalence of pfdhfr
      51I, 59R and 108N, respectively and the majority of patients (95.9%) were found
      to carry both 59R and 108N. The prevalence of single mutation at pfdhps 437G gene
      was 26.9% before the adoption of SP-AS, but as SP was used as the first line
      treatment; this mutation started to increase and reached a high level of 55.5% in
      2008 (chi(2) test, P<0.05). However, three years after the introduction of SP-AS,
      this prevalence was reduced from 55.5% (in 2008) to 39.1% (in 2009) and then
      40.5% (in 2010). The frequency of parasites carrying pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations
      (N(51)R(59)N(108)/G(437)) decreased from 53.3% in 2008 to 39.1% in 2009 and 38%
      in 2010. In addition, no significant reduction was seen in the frequency of
      mutant alleles of pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1 86Y after CQ was discontinued from study
      areas as a treatment for P. falciparum. This is explained by the fixation of
      pfcrt 76T in the falciparum populations that need more time to recover from CQ
      sensitivity in the absence of drug pressure in this region. In conclusion, the
      present findings suggest that in Iran, SP is still effective for the treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria as a partner drug of Artemisinin Combination
      Therapy (ACT) in this region.

TI  - Quantification of the burden and consequences of pregnancy-associated malaria in 
      the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
PG  - 1762-71
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir625 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) produces poor birth outcomes, but 
      its prevalence is commonly estimated in convenience samples. METHODS: We assessed
      the prevalence of malaria using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      estimated the consequences of infection on birth outcomes, using specimens from a
      nationally representative sample of 4570 women of childbearing age (WOCBA)
      responding to the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey in Democratic Republic of
      the Congo (DRC). RESULTS: Overall, 31.2% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      29.2-33.1) of WOCBA were parasitemic, which was significantly more common in
      pregnant (37.2% [31.0-43.5]) than nonpregnant women (30.4% [CI, 28.4-32.5],
      prevalence ratio [PR] 1.22 [1.02-1.47]). Plasmodium falciparum was highest among 
      pregnant women (36.6% vs 28.8%, PR 1.27 [1.05-1.53]). By contrast, P malariae was
      less common in pregnant (0.6%) compared with nonpregnant women (2.7%, PR 0.23
      [0.09-0.56]). Extrapolation of the prevalence estimate to the population at risk 
      of malaria in DRC suggests 1.015 million births are affected by P falciparum
      infection annually, and that adherence to preventive measures could prevent up to
      549 000 episodes of pregnancy-associated malaria and 47 000 low-birth-weight
      births. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-associated malaria and its consequences are highly
      prevalent in the DRC. Increasing the uptake of malaria preventive measures
      represents a significant opportunity to improve birth outcomes and neonatal
      health.

TI  - Treatment guided by rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in Tanzanian children:
      safety and alternative bacterial diagnoses.
PG  - 290
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: WHO guidelines for the treatment of young children with suspected
      malaria have recently changed from presumptive treatment to anti-malarial
      treatment guided by a blood slide or malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
      However, there is limited evidence of the safety of this policy in routine
      outpatient settings in Africa. METHODS: Children 3-59 months of age with a
      non-severe febrile illness and no obvious cause were enrolled over a period of
      one year in a malaria endemic area of Tanzania. Treatment was determined by the
      results of a clinical examination and RDT result, and blood culture and serum
      lactate were also collected. RDT-negative children were followed up over 14 days.
      RESULTS: Over the course of one year, 965 children were enrolled; 158 (16.4%)
      were RDT-positive and treated with artemether-lumefantrine and 807 (83.4%) were
      RDT-negative and treated with non-anti-malarial medicines. Compared with
      RDT-positives, RDT-negative children were on average younger with a lower
      axillary temperature and more likely to have a history of cough or difficulty in 
      breathing. Six (0.6%) children became RDT-positive after enrollment, all of whom 
      were PCR-negative for Plasmodium falciparum DNA at enrollment. In addition, 12
      (1.2%) children were admitted to hospital, one with possible malaria, none of
      whom died. A bacterial pathogen was identified in 9/965 (0.9%) children, eight of
      whom were RDT-negative and one was RDT-positive, but slide-negative. Excluding
      three children with Salmonella typhi, all of the children with bacteraemia were
      </= 12 months of age. Compared to double-read research slide results RDTs had a
      sensitivity of 97.8% (95% CI 96.9-98.7) and specificity of 96.3% (95% CI
      96.3-98.4). CONCLUSIONS: Use of RDTs to direct the use of anti-malarial drugs in 
      young children did not result in any missed diagnoses of malaria although new
      infections soon after a consultation with a negative RDT result may undermine
      confidence in results. Invasive bacterial disease is uncommon in children with
      non-severe illness and most cases occurred in infants with a current fever.

PG  - 263-6
AB  - According to the sequences of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of
      Plasmodium spp., universal and species-specific primers were designed to detect
      malaria and identify species. 60 blood samples were detected by the established
      nested PCR method. The results were compared with those of microscopic
      examination. 40 blood samples were Plasmodium-positive by nested PCR with 22
      samples of P. falciparum, 13 of P. vivas, 3 with P. falciparum and P. vivax mixed
      infection, 1 of P. ovale and 1 of unclassified malaria infection. Altogether, the
      coincidence between the results of nested PCR and microscopy stood for 76.7%
      (46/60), including 18 of P. falciparum, 11 of P. vivax and 17 negatives. Further 
      sequence analysis and real-time PCR were performed to detect blood samples with
      discrepancy, results of which were the same as that of nested PCR. The amplified 
      product of P. ovale was sequenced and showed 100% homology to the corresponding
      part of P. ovale SSU rRNA gene sequence (GenBank No. DQ845247), which confirmed
      that the case was imported ovale malaria.

PG  - 239-41
AB  - CP23 gene of Cryptosporidium parvum was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the
      recombinant protein was purified. Its immunoreactivity was analyzed by Western
      blotting. Serum samples were collected from outpatients of different ages from
      August to November, 2010 in Changchun. Indirect ELISA was established to detect
      the anti-CP23 IgG in sera. Western blotting analysis indicated that the
      recombinant CP23 protein was recognized by sera from Cryptosporidium
      panum-infected calves and positive human sera, but not recognized by sera of mice
      infected with Schistosoma japonicum, sera from falciparum malaria patients and
      negative human sera. The overall anti-CP23 IgG positive rate was 3.2% (65/2 046).
      The seropositive rate was 2.7% (28/1 036) in men and 3.7% (37/1 010) in women (P 
      > 0.05). The seropositive rates were significantly different among age groups (P 
      < 0.05), and the age group of 71-80 had the highest positive rate (8.6%, 13/152).

AB  - During Plasmodium falciparum infection, host red blood cell (RBC) remodeling is
      required for the parasite's survival. Such modifications are mediated by the
      export of parasite proteins into the RBC that alter the architecture of the RBC
      membrane and enable cytoadherence. It is probable that some exported proteins
      also play a protective role against the host defense response. This may be of
      particular importance for the gametocyte stage of the life cycle that is
      responsible for malaria transmission, since the gametocyte remains in contact
      with blood as it proceeds through five morphological stages (I to V) during its
      12-day maturation. Using microarray analysis, we identified several genes with
      encoded secretory or export sequences that were differentially expressed during
      early gametocytogenesis. One of these, PfGECO, encodes a predicted type IV heat
      shock protein 40 (HSP40) that we show is expressed in gametocyte stages I to IV
      and is exported to the RBC cytoplasm. HSPs are traditionally induced under
      stressful conditions to maintain homeostasis, but PfGECO expression was not
      increased upon heat shock, suggesting an alternate function. Targeted disruption 
      of PfGECO indicated that the gene is not essential for gametocytogenesis in
      vitro, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) showed that there was 
      no compensatory expression of the other type IV HSP40 genes. Although P.
      falciparum HSP40 members are implicated in the trafficking of proteins to the RBC
      surface, removal of PfGECO did not affect the targeting of other exported
      gametocyte proteins. This work has expanded the repertoire of known
      gametocyte-exported proteins to include a type IV HSP40, PfGECO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are widely used to diagnose
      malaria. The present study evaluated a new RDT, the Clearview(R) Malaria pLDH
      test targeting the pan-Plasmodium antigen lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). METHODS: 
      The Clearview(R) Malaria pLDH test was evaluated on fresh samples obtained in
      returned international travellers using microscopy corrected by PCR as the
      reference method. Included samples were Plasmodium falciparum (139), Plasmodium
      vivax (22), Plasmodium ovale (20), Plasmodium malariae (7), and 102 negative.
      RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for the detection of Plasmodium spp was 93.2%. For
      P. falciparum, the sensitivity was 98.6%; for P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae,
      overall sensitivities were 90.9%, 60.0% and 85.7% respectively. For P. falciparum
      and for P. vivax, the sensitivities increased to 100% at parasite densities above
      100/mul. The specificity was 100%. The test was easily to perform and the result 
      was stable for at least 1 hour. CONCLUSION: The Clearview(R) Malaria pLDH was
      efficient for the diagnosis of malaria. The test was very sensitive for P.
      falciparum and P. vivax detection. The sensitivities for P. ovale and P. malariae
      were better than other RDTs.

      falciparum.
PG  - 283
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, Plasmodium falciparum parasites bearing Pfdhfr I164L single
      mutation were found in Madagascar. These new mutants may challenge the use of
      antifolates for the intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy
      (IPTp). Assays with transgenic bacteria suggested that I164L parasites have a
      wild-type phenotype for pyrimethamine but it had to be confirmed by testing the
      parasites themselves. METHODS: Thirty Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates
      were collected in 2008 in the south-east of Madagascar. A part of Pfdhfr gene
      encompassing codons 6 to 206 was amplified by PCR and the determination of the
      presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed by DNA sequencing. The 
      multiplicity of infection was estimated by using an allelic family-specific
      nested PCR. Isolates that appeared monoclonal were submitted to culture
      adaptation. Determination of IC(50s) to pyrimethamine was performed on adapted
      isolates. RESULTS: Four different Pfdhfr alleles were found: the 164L single
      mutant-type (N = 13), the wild-type (N = 7), the triple mutant-type 51I/59R/108N 
      (N = 9) and the double mutant-type 108N/164L (N = 1). Eleven out 30 (36.7%) of P.
      falciparum isolates were considered as monoclonal infection. Among them, five
      isolates were successfully adapted in culture and tested for pyrimethamine in
      vitro susceptibility. The wild-type allele was the most susceptible with a 50%
      inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) < 10 nM. The geometric mean of IC(50) of the
      three I164L mutant isolates was 6-fold higher than the wild-type with 61.3 nM (SD
      = 3.2 nM, CI95%: 53.9-69.7 nM). These values remained largely below the IC(50) of
      the triple mutant parasite (13,804 nM). CONCLUSION: The IC(50)s of the I164L
      mutant isolates were significantly higher than those of the wild-type (6-fold
      higher) and close from those usually reported for simple mutants S108N
      (roughly10-fold higher than wild type). Given the observed values, the
      determination of IC(50)s directly on parasites did not confirm what has been
      found on transgenic bacteria. The prevalence increase of the Pfdhfr I164L single 
      mutant parasite since 2006 could be explained by the selective advantage of this 
      allele under sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pressure. The emergence of highly
      resistant alleles should be considered in the future, in particular because an
      unexpected double mutant-type allele S108N/I164L has been already detected.

      transcriptomes in human NK cells: IFN-alpha/beta pathway versus TREM signaling.
PG  - e24963
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0024963 [doi]
AB  - The protective immunity of natural killer (NK) cells against malarial infections 
      is thought to be due to early production of type II interferon (IFN) and possibly
      direct NK cell cytotoxicity. To better understand this mechanism, a microarray
      analysis was conducted on NK cells from healthy donors PBMCs that were
      co-cultured with P. falciparum 3D7-infected erythrocytes. A very similar pattern 
      of gene expression was observed among all donors for each treatment in three
      replicas. Parasites particularly modulated genes involved in IFN-alpha/beta
      signaling as well as molecules involved in the activation of interferon
      regulatory factors, pathways known to play a role in the antimicrobial immune
      response. This pattern of transcription was entirely different from that shown by
      NK cells treated with IL-12 and IL-18, in which IFN-gamma- and TREM-1-related
      genes were over-expressed. These results suggest that P. falciparum parasites and
      the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18 have diverse imprints on the transcriptome of human
      primary NK cells. IFN-alpha-related genes are the prominent molecules induced by 
      parasites on NK cells and arise as candidate biomarkers that merit to be further 
      investigated as potential new tools in malaria control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accuracy of diagnosis is the core for malaria control. Although
      microscopy is the gold standard in malaria diagnosis, its reliability is largely 
      dependent on user skill. We compared performance of Cyscope fluorescence
      microscope with the Giemsa stained light microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria 
      among pregnant women at Medani Hospital in Central Sudan. The area is
      characterized by unstable malaria transmission. METHODS: Socio-demographic
      characteristics and obstetrics history were gathered using pre-tested
      questionnaires. Blood samples were collected from febrile pregnant women who were
      referred as malaria case following initial diagnosis by general microscopist.
      RESULTS: During the study period 128 febrile pregnant women presented at the
      hospital. Among them, Plasmodium falciparum malaria was detected in 82 (64.1%)
      and 80 (62.5%) by the Giemsa-stained light microscopy and the Cyscope
      fluorescence microscope, respectively. The sensitivity of the Cyscope
      fluorescence microscope was 97.6% (95% CI: 92.2%-99.6%). Out of 46 which were
      negative by Giemsa-stained light microscopy, 5 were positive by the Cyscope
      fluorescence microscope. This is translated in specificity of 89.1% (95% CI:
      77.5%-95.9%). The positive and negative predictive value of Cyscope fluorescence 
      microscope was 94.1% (95% CI: 87.4% -97.8%) and 95.3% (95% CI: 85.4% - 99.2%),
      respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that Cyscope fluorescence
      microscope is a reliable diagnostic, sensitive and specific in diagnosing P.
      falciparum malaria among pregnant women in this setting. Further studies are
      needed to determine effectiveness in diagnosing other Plasmodium species and to
      compare it with other diagnostic tools e.g. rapid diagnostic tests and PCR.

      protein-2 in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of malaria parasite populations circulating in
      an area is part of site characterization, as a basis for evaluating the impact of
      malaria interventions on genetic diversity, parasite species, and multiplicity of
      infection. The present study was aimed at analysing genetic diversity of
      Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP-1 and MSP-2) and to
      determine the multiplicity of infection in clinical isolates collected from
      children living in the Southern district of Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo.
      METHODS: A total of 125 isolates from patients with uncomplicated malaria
      attending Terinkyo and Madibou health centres were collected between January and 
      June 2005 while evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of amodiaquine-artesunate
      combination. DNA was extracted and msp-1 and msp-2 genes were genotyped using
      allele-specific nested-PCR. RESULTS: Out of 468 distinct fragments detected, 15
      msp-1 and 20 msp-2 genotypes were identified. For the msp-1 gene, K1 family was
      the predominant allelic type carried alone or in association with RO33 and Mad20 
      types, whereas the 3D7 family was the most prevalent in the msp-2 gene. Overall, 
      the mean multiplicity of infection was 2.2. Out of 125 samples, 104 (83%)
      harboured more than one parasite genotype. There was no statistical significant
      difference in the multiplicity of infection by either sex or age of patients.
      However, a statistically significant correlation was found between parasite
      densities and the number of genotypes. CONCLUSION: Polymorphism in P. falciparum 
      clinical isolates from Brazzaville was high and mainly of multiple clones. The
      basis for the positive association between parasite densities and multiplicity of
      infection is discussed.

TI  - [Urgent tasks of malaria elimination programs].
PG  - 3-9
AB  - The state-of-the-art of malaria elimination programs worldwide and the advances
      made in the past decade were analyzed and assessed. The factors contributing to
      or reducing the achievement of the final objective of malaria elimination--to
      interrupt the local transmission of the infection and to steadily maintain the
      achieved successes are given. Technical problems are defined at the final stages 
      of a malaria elimination program. The problems include difficulties in
      identifying patients and asymptomatic parasite carriers due to the low level of
      malaria transmission and the absence of highly effective methods for detecting
      malaria parasites with low parasitemia, as well as mixed malaria infections
      requiring the use of different treatment regimens and antimalarial drugs.
      Large-scale uncontrolled population migration is noted to be of importance in
      spreading the infection in a malaria-free area. The solution of urgent tasks is
      to improve the existing methods and develop new ones for the detection and
      treatment of the infection and a package of antimalarial measures.

TI  - Detection of etiological agents of malaria in howler monkeys from Atlantic
      Forests, rescued in regions of Sao Paulo city, Brazil.
PG  - 392-400

AB  - BACKGROUND: In some states of the Brazilian extra-Amazonian region, such as the
      Atlantic Forest area, autochthonous human cases of malaria were related to simian
      malarias and vice versa. METHODS: To verify the presence of Plasmodium, 50 blood 
      samples of howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) rescued from the
      Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo city, where the Atlantic Forest is present, were
      analyzed. The samples were submitted to microscopy (thin and thick blood smears),
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescent assay
      (IFA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Only one smear showed forms 
      reminiscent of Plasmodium vivax. In ELISA, the frequencies of antibodies against 
      synthetic peptides corresponding to circumsporozoite protein of P. vivax VK210
      'classic' (Pvc), P. vivax VK247, human P. vivax-like (Pvk and Pvl), P.
      malariae/P. brasilianum (Pm), and P. falciparum (Pf) were 24.0% (12/50) for Pvc, 
      8.0% (04/50) for Pvk, 6.0% (03/50) for Pvl, 24.0% (12/50) for Pm, and 28.0%
      (14/50) for Pf, while the frequency of antibodies against PvMSP119 recombinant
      proteins was 42.0% (21/50). No serum reacted against PfMSP1-19. In IFA,the
      seropositivity of antibodies against asexual forms of P. malariae was 31.3%
      (15/48). We utilized three PCR protocols to develop a molecular consensus
      (positive results in, at least, two protocols). The frequency of Plasmodium
      infections detected by PCR was 18.0% (09/50) for P. vivax, 4.0% (02/50) for P.
      malariae, and 76.0% (38/50) of samples were negative. The molecular consensus was
      not seen in 4.0% (02/50) of samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a
      possible interaction between human and simian malaria coming from a zoonotic
      cycle cannot be discarded because simians that live in the areas of the Atlantic 
      Forest could play a role as a reservoir for Plasmodium.

TI  - Characterization and tissue-specific expression patterns of the Plasmodium
      chabaudi cir multigene family.
PG  - 272
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variant antigens expressed on the surface of parasitized red blood
      cells (pRBCs) are important virulence factors of malaria parasites. Whereas
      Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (PfEMP1) are responsible
      for sequestration of mature parasites, little is known about putative ligands
      mediating cytoadherence to host receptors in other Plasmodium species. Candidates
      include members of the pir superfamily found in the human parasite Plasmodium
      vivax (vir), in the simian pathogen Plasmodium knowlesi (kir) and in the rodent
      malarias Plasmodium yoelii (yir), Plasmodium berghei (bir) and Plasmodium
      chabaudi (cir). The aim of this study was to reveal a potential involvement of
      cir genes in P. chabaudi sequestration. METHODS: Subfamilies of cir genes were
      identified by bioinformatic analyses of annotated sequence data in the Plasmodium
      Genome Database. In order to examine tissue-specific differences in the
      expression of cir mRNAs, RT-PCR with subfamily-specific primers was used. In
      total, 432 cDNA clones derived from six different tissues were sequenced to
      characterize the transcribed cir gene repertoire. To confirm differences in
      transcription profiles of cir genes, restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (RFLP) analyses were performed to compare different host tissues and to identify 
      changes during the course of P. chabaudi infections in immunocompetent mice.
      RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of annotated P. chabaudi putative CIR proteins
      identified two major subfamilies. Comparison of transcribed cir genes from six
      different tissues revealed significant differences in the frequency clones
      belonging to individual cir gene subgroups were obtained from different tissues. 
      Further hints of difference in the transcription of cir genes in individual
      tissues were obtained by RFLP. Whereas only minimal changes in the transcription 
      pattern of cir genes could be detected during the developmental cycle of the
      parasites, switching to expression of other cir genes during the course of an
      infection was observed around or after peak parasitemia. CONCLUSIONS: The
      tissue-specific expression of cir mRNAs found in this study indicates correlation
      between expression of CIR antigens and distribution of parasites in inner organs.
      Together with comparable results for other members of the pir superfamily this
      suggests a role of cir and other pir genes in antigenic variation and
      sequestration of malaria parasites.

PG  - 269
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The different taxa belonging to Anopheles gambiae complex display
      phenotypic differences that may impact their contribution to malaria
      transmission. More specifically, their susceptibility to infection, resulting
      from a co-evolution between parasite and vector, might be different. The aim of
      this study was to compare the susceptibility of M and S molecular forms of
      Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis to infection by Plasmodium falciparum.
      METHODS: F3 progenies of Anopheles gambiae s.l. collected in Senegal were
      infected, using direct membrane feeding, with P. falciparum gametocyte-containing
      blood sampled on volunteer patients. The presence of oocysts was determined by
      light microscopy after 7 days, and the presence of sporozoite by ELISA after 14
      days. Mosquito species and molecular forms were identified by PCR. RESULTS: The
      oocyst rate was significantly higher in the molecular S form (79.07%) than in the
      M form (57.81%, Fisher's exact test p<0.001) and in Anopheles arabiensis (55.38%,
      Fisher's exact test vs. S group p<0.001). Mean+/-s.e.m. number of oocyst was
      greater in the An. gambiae S form (1.72+/-0.26) than in the An. gambiae M form
      (0.64+/-0.04, p<0.0001) and in the An. arabiensis group (0.58+/-0.04, vs. S
      group, p<0.0001). Sporozoite rate was also higher in the molecular form S
      (83.52%) than in form M (50.98%, Fisher's exact test p<0.001) and Anopheles
      arabiensis 50.85%, Fisher's exact test vs. S group p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Infected
      in the same experimental conditions, the molecular form S of An. gambiae is more 
      susceptible to infection by P. falciparum than the molecular form M of An.
      gambiae and An. arabiensis.

TI  - Var Gene promoter activation in clonal Plasmodium falciparum isolates follows a
      hierarchy and suggests a conserved switching program that is independent of
      genetic background.
PG  - 1620-31
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir594 [doi]
AB  - Antigenic variation of Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by a mutually exclusive 
      expression mechanism that limits expression to an individual member of the
      multicopy var gene family. This process determines the antigenic and adhesive
      phenotype of the infected red blood cell. Previously, we showed that var gene
      switching is influenced by chromosomal position. Here, we address whether var
      gene transcription follows a general conserved pattern in long-term laboratory
      parasites and in recently culture-adapted field parasites. Activation of the var 
      gene family was monitored in biological replicates in each parasite isolate every
      3-5 generations for up to 3 months. We used transgenic parasites carrying a
      drug-selectable marker at a defined var locus to characterize var gene activation
      after the exclusive expression of the transgene. Transgenic parasites exhibited a
      repeatable hierarchy of var gene activation and a fluctuating transcriptional
      activity of the transgenic var locus. Transcriptional profiling of wild-type
      laboratory and field parasites showed a universal bias toward transcription of
      UpsC var genes and a fluctuating transcriptional activity of the dominant var
      promoter. The data suggest the existence of an intrinsic var gene transcription
      program that is independent of genetic background.

TI  - In vitro amodiaquine resistance and its association with mutations in pfcrt and
      pfmdr1 genes of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Nigeria.
PG  - 224-30
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.08.013 [doi]
AB  - Amodiaquine (AQ) is currently being used as a partner drug in combination with
      artesunate for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in most endemic countries of
      Africa. In the absence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance, molecular 
      markers of resistance to AQ may be useful for monitoring the development and
      spread of parasites resistance to Artesunate-Amodiaquine combination. This study 
      was designed to assess the potential role of polymorphisms on pfcrt and pfmdr1
      genes and parasite in vitro susceptibility for epidemiological surveillance of
      amodiaquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. The modified schizont inhibition
      assay was used to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of 98 patients'
      isolates of P. falciparum to amodiaquine. Polymorphisms on parasites pfcrt and
      pfmdr1 genes were determined with nested PCR followed by sequencing. The
      geometric mean (GM) of AQ 50% inhibitory concentration (IC-50) in the 97 P.
      falciparum isolates was 20.48 nM (95% CI 16.53-25.36 nM). Based on the cut-off
      value for AQ in vitro susceptibility, 87% (84) of the P. falciparum isolates were
      sensitive to AQ (GM IC-50=16.32 nM; 95%CI 13.3-20.04 nM) while 13% were resistant
      to AQ in vitro (GM IC-50=88.73nM; 95%CI 69.67-113.0nM). Molecular analysis showed
      presence of mutant CVIET pfcrt haplotype, mutant pfmdr1Tyr86 allele and the
      double mutant CVIET pfcrt haplotype+pfmdr1Tyr86 in 72%, 49% and 35%,
      respectively. The GM IC-50 of isolates harboring the wild-type pfcrt CVMNK
      haplotype+pfmdr1Asn86 allele (3.93nM; 95%CI 1.82-8.46 nM) was significantly lower
      (p=0.001) than those isolates harboring the double mutant pfcrt CVIET
      haplotype+pfmdr1Tyr86 allele (50.40 nM; 95%CI 40.17-63.24 nM). Results from this 
      study suggest that polymorphisms in pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes are important for AQ
      resistance and therefore may be useful for epidemiological surveillance of P.
      falciparum resistance to AQ.

      areas of Thailand.
PG  - 130-3

AB  - Malaria is the most important public health problem in several countries. In
      Thailand, co-infections of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are common.
      We examined the prevalence and patterns of mutations in P. vivax dihydrofolate
      reductase (Pvdhfr) and P. vivax dihydropteroate synthase (Pvdhps) in 103 blood
      samples collected from patients with P. vivax infection who had attended the
      malaria clinic in Mae Sot, Tak Province during 2009 and 2010. Using nested
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorfism, we examined
      single nucleotide polymorphisms-haplotypes at amino acid positions 13, 33, 57,
      58, 61, 117 and 173 of Pvdhfr and 383 and 553 of Pvdhps. All parasite isolates
      carried mutant Pvdhfr alleles, of which the most common alleles were triple
      mutants (99%). Eight different types of Pvdhfr and combination alleles were
      found, as follows: 57I/58R/117T, 57I/58R/117T, 57I/58R/117T/N, 57L/58R/117T,
      57L/58R/117T, 58R/61M/117N, 58R/61M/117N and 13L/57L/58R/117T. The most common
      Pvdhfr alleles were 57I/58R/117T (77.7%), 57I/58R/117T/N (1%), 57L/58R/117T
      (5.8%) and 58R/61M/117N (14.5%). The most common Pvdhfr alleles were 57I/58R/117T
      (77.7%), 57I/58R/117T/N (1%), 57L/58R/117T (5.8%) and 58R/61M/117N (14.5%).
      Additionally, we recovered one isolate of a carrying a quadruple mutant allele,
      13L/57L/58R/117T. The most prevalent Pvdhps allele was a single mutation in amino
      acid 383 (82.5%), followed by the wild-type A383/A553 (17.5%) allele. Results
      suggest that all P. vivax isolates in Thailand carry some combination of
      mutations in Pvdhfr and Pvdhps. Our findings demonstrate that development of new 
      antifolate drugs effective against sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant P. vivax
      is required.

      artemether-lumefantrine in eastern Sudan identified 5 treatment failures among
      100 evaluable patients; 9 further individuals were parasite positive by PCR
      during follow-up. Polymorphisms in pfatpase6 and pfmdr1 were evaluated by DNA
      sequencing. One individual carried parasites with a novel pfmdr1 polymorphism
      (F1044L). pfmdr1 gene amplification in parasites prior to treatment occurred in
      three individuals who had recurrent infection during follow-up.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic
      polymorphisms of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter
      (pfcrt), P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum ATPase 
      (pfatp6) and clinical outcome after a three-day mefloquine-artesunate combination
      therapy in 134 patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in an
      area with multidrug resistance along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Analysis of
      gene mutation and amplification were performed by nested real-time polymerase
      chain reaction and SYBR Green I real-time polymerase chain reaction,
      respectively. The mutation for pfcrt (codons 76, 220, 271, 326, 356, and 371) was
      found in all isolates (100%), whereas no mutation of pfmdr1 (codon 86) and pfatp6
      (codons 37, 693, 769, 898) was found. The Pfmdr1 copy number was significantly
      higher in isolates with recrudescence (median number = 2.44) compared with a
      sensitive response (median number = 1.44). The gene copy number was also found to
      be significantly higher in paired isolates collected before treatment and at the 
      time of recrudescence. All isolates carried one pfatp6 gene copy.

AB  - We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and the frequency of the dhfr
      triple mutation that is associated with antifolate drug resistance among P.
      falciparum isolates obtained from pregnant women in Ilorin, Nigeria. The study
      included 179 women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy who have been
      exposed to intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Thick and thin blood films and PCR were used for
      malaria parasite detection. Blood group and hemoglobin concentration were also
      determined. Mutations in P. falciparum dhfr were analyzed by sequencing DNA
      obtained from blood spots on filter paper. Prevalence of P. falciparum in the
      population (PCR corrected) was 44.1% (79/179) with 66.7% and 33.3% in the second 
      and third trimester, respectively. Primigravide (51.3%) were more infected than
      multigravide (48.7%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Women 
      in blood group A had the highest P. falciparum malaria infection (30.8%). The
      mean hemoglobin concentration was lower among those infected with malaria
      parasite. Also, more women with the malaria parasite (38.4%) had anemia compare
      to those without (21.4%). The prevalence of the P. falciparum dhfr mutant alleles
      was 64.1%, 61.5%, 38.5%, and 12.8% for I51, R59, N108 and T108, respectively.
      None of the samples had the L164 mutation. The combined triple dhfr mutation (51 
      + 59 + 108) in the population was 17.9% (7 of 39). Also, the prevalence of the
      triple mutant alleles was not significantly associated to the number of doses of 
      SP taken by the women. These findings highlight the need for a regular assessment
      of IPTp/SP efficacy, and evaluation of possible alternative drugs.

TI  - A pilot randomised trial of induced blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum infections 
      in healthy volunteers for testing efficacy of new antimalarial drugs.
PG  - e21914

AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical to the development of new drugs for treatment of malaria is 
      the capacity to safely evaluate their activity in human subjects. The approach
      that has been most commonly used is testing in subjects with natural malaria
      infection, a methodology that may expose symptomatic subjects to the risk of
      ineffective treatment. Here we describe the development and pilot testing of a
      system to undertake experimental infection using blood stage Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites (BSP). The objectives of the study were to assess the
      feasibility and safety of induced BSP infection as a method for assessment of
      efficacy of new drug candidates for the treatment of P. falciparum infection.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, unblinded, Phase IIa trial was undertaken in
      19 healthy, malaria-naive, male adult volunteers who were infected with BSP and
      followed with careful clinical and laboratory observation, including a sensitive,
      quantitative malaria PCR assay. Volunteers were randomly allocated to treatment
      with either of two licensed antimalarial drug combinations,
      artemether-lumefantrine (A/L) or atovaquone-proguanil (A/P). In the first cohort 
      (n = 6) where volunteers received approximately 360 BSP, none reached the target 
      parasitemia of 1,000 before the day designated for antimalarial treatment (day
      6). In the second and third cohorts, 13 volunteers received 1,800 BSP, with all
      reaching the target parasitemia before receiving treatment (A/L, n = 6; A/P, n = 
      7) The study demonstrated safety in the 19 volunteers tested, and a significant
      difference in the clearance kinetics of parasitemia between the drugs in the 13
      evaluable subjects, with mean parasite reduction ratios of 759 for A/L and 17 for
      A/P (95% CI 120-4786 and 7-40 respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This system
      offers a flexible and safe approach to testing the in vivo activity of novel
      antimalarials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01055002.

      in a region of Tanzania with hypoendemic malaria.

AB  - Accurate malaria diagnosis has dual roles in identification of symptomatic
      persons for effective malaria treatment and also enumeration of asymptomatic
      persons who contribute to the epidemiologic determinants of transmission. Three
      currently used diagnostic tests, microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and
      real-time PCR, all have different sensitivities and specificities, which are
      parasite density dependent. Here, we compare their concordance among 451 febrile 
      episodes in a cohort of 2,058 children and adults followed over 6 months in a
      region in central Tanzania with hypoendemic malaria. Microscopy, a histidine-rich
      protein-based RDT, and two different real-time PCR gene probes detected
      Plasmodium falciparum in 20, 54, 41, and 78 episodes of fever, respectively. They
      had complete concordance in only 9 episodes. Real-time PCR with an 18S probe was 
      more sensitive than with a mitochondrial probe for cytochrome b despite higher
      copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA. Both PCR yields were increased 4-fold by
      glycogen/acetate precipitation with low-speed centrifugation. Duplicate PCR
      increases low-density malaria detection. RDT had the highest number of unique
      positives, presumably from persistent antigen despite the absence of parasites,
      although RDT did not detect 3 parasitemias with over 1,000 parasites/mul. In a
      latent class analysis, real-time PCR had significantly higher sensitivity than
      did microscopy or RDT. Agreement between real-time PCR, RDT, and microscopy was
      highest in March and April, when both the P. falciparum parasite rate and
      parasite densities are highest. Real-time PCR is more sensitive and specific than
      RDT and microscopy in low-prevalence, low-parasite-density settings.

TI  - Efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets in use in Macha, Zambia, against the
      local Anopheles arabiensis population.
PG  - 254
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mosquito Anopheles arabiensis is the primary vector of Plasmodium
      falciparum in Macha, Zambia. A major portion of Zambia's current malaria control 
      programme relies on long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and indoor
      residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides. Currently, the efficacy of these
      measures against An. arabiensis in Macha is unknown, and previous data has shown 
      that An. arabiensis has continued to feed on human hosts, despite high ITN
      coverage. It is possible that this could be due to either decreased efficacy of
      ITNs in used in Macha, or pyrethroid resistance in the vector. METHODS: F1
      offspring of field-collected adult An. arabiensis were tested for insecticide
      resistance, using CDC bottle bioassays and deltamethrin ITN susceptibility
      assays. The mosquitoes were characterized for the knock-down resistance (kdr)
      allele by PCR. LLINs that had been in use for two years in nearby villages were
      collected and tested for residual deltamethrin concentration and net quality, and
      were used in bioassays against susceptible colonized Anopheles gambiae s.s.
      Keele. Additionally, a survey on ITN use and care was conducted among LLIN
      owners. RESULTS: In the F1 An. arabiensis field population, low levels of
      resistance to DDT and deltamethrin-treated net material were detected by
      bioassay, although the knock-down resistance (kdr) allele not present in the
      population. ITN evaluations revealed high variability in residual deltamethrin
      concentration, quality of the nets, and mosquito mortality in bioassays.
      Mortality against An. gambiae s.s. in bioassays was correlated with residual
      deltamethrin concentration, which was dependent upon the number of washes each
      net had received. CONCLUSIONS: Proper LLIN care was a strong determinant of LLIN 
      efficacy, indicating that education on the importance of LLIN use and care is key
      when distributing nets. As there is little insecticide resistance in the local
      vector population, degradation of LLINs most likely allowed for continued human
      feeding by An. arabiensis. Continued monitoring and assessment of both the vector
      population and the efficacy of LLINs in use is necessary in order to
      appropriately modify vector control operations and prevent the development of
      pyrethroid resistance.

TI  - A review of mixed malaria species infections in anopheline mosquitoes.
PG  - 253
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with malaria mixed species infections are common and
      under reported. In PCR studies conducted in Asia mixed infection rates often
      exceed 20%. In South-East Asia, approximately one third of patients treated for
      falciparum malaria experience a subsequent Plasmodium vivax infection with a time
      interval suggesting relapse. It is uncertain whether the two infections are
      acquired simultaneously or separately. To determine whether mixed species
      infections in humans are derived from mainly from simultaneous or separate
      mosquito inoculations the literature on malaria species infection in wild
      captured anopheline mosquitoes was reviewed. METHODS: The biomedical literature
      was searched for studies of malaria infection and species identification in
      trapped wild mosquitoes and artificially infected mosquitoes. The study location 
      and year, collection methods, mosquito species, number of specimens, parasite
      stage examined (oocysts or sporozoites), and the methods of parasite detection
      and speciation were tabulated. The entomological results in South East Asia were 
      compared with mixed infection rates documented in patients in clinical studies.
      RESULTS: In total 63 studies were identified. Individual anopheline mosquitoes
      were examined for different malaria species in 28 of these. There were 14 studies
      from Africa; four with species evaluations in individual captured mosquitoes
      (SEICM). One study, from Ghana, identified a single mixed infection. No mixed
      infections were identified in Central and South America (seven studies, two
      SEICM). 42 studies were conducted in Asia and Oceania (11 from Thailand; 27
      SEICM). The proportion of anophelines infected with Plasmodium falciparum
      parasites only was 0.51% (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.57%), for P. vivax only was 0.26%
      (95% CI: 0.21 to 0.30%), and for mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infections was 
      0.036% (95% CI: 0.016 to 0.056%). The proportion of mixed infections in
      mosquitoes was significantly higher than expected by chance (P < 0.001), but was 
      one fifth of that sufficient to explain the high rates of clinical mixed
      infections by simultaneous inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: There are relatively few
      data on mixed infection rates in mosquitoes from Africa. Mixed species malaria
      infections may be acquired by simultaneous inoculation of sporozoites from
      multiply infected anopheline mosquitoes but this is relatively unusual. In South 
      East Asia, where P. vivax infection follows P. falciparum malaria in one third of
      cases, the available entomological information suggests that the majority of
      these mixed species malaria infections are acquired from separate inoculations.

AB  - The African continent is currently experiencing rapid population growth, with
      rising urbanization increasing the percentage of the population living in large
      towns and cities. We studied the impact of the degree of urbanization on the
      population genetics of Plasmodium falciparum in urban and peri-urban areas in and
      around the city of Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. This field setting, which
      incorporates local health centers situated in areas of varying urbanization, is
      of interest as it allows the characterization of malaria parasites from areas
      where the human, parasite, and mosquito populations are shared, but where
      differences in the degree of urbanization (leading to dramatic differences in
      transmission intensity) cause the pattern of malaria transmission to differ
      greatly. We have investigated how these differences in transmission intensity
      affect parasite genetic diversity, including the amount of genetic polymorphism
      in each area, the degree of linkage disequilibrium within the populations, and
      the prevalence and frequency of drug resistance markers. To determine parasite
      population structure, heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium, we typed eight
      microsatellite markers and performed haplotype analysis of the msp1 gene by PCR. 
      Mutations known to be associated with resistance to the antimalarial drugs
      chloroquine and pyrimethamine were determined by sequencing the relevant portions
      of the crt and dhfr genes, respectively. We found that parasite genetic diversity
      was comparable between the two sites, with high levels of polymorphism being
      maintained in both areas despite dramatic differences in transmission intensity. 
      Crucially, we found that the frequencies of genetic markers of drug resistance
      against pyrimethamine and chloroquine differed significantly between the sites,
      indicative of differing selection pressures in the two areas.

TI  - Molecular monitoring of resistant dhfr and dhps allelic haplotypes in Morogoro
      and Mvomero districts in south eastern Tanzania.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)
      emerged in Plasmodium falciparum from Asia in the 1960s and subsequently spread
      to Africa. In Tanzania, SP use as a national policy began in 1983 as a second
      line to chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, until August
      2001 when it was approved to replace CQ as a national first line. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study assesses the frequency of resistant dhfr and dhps alleles in
      Morogoro-Mvomero district in south eastern Tanzania and contrast their rate of
      change during 17 years of SP second line use against five years of SP first line 
      use. METHODOLOGY: Cross sectional surveys of asymptomatic infections were carried
      out at the end of rainy season during July-September of 2000, when SP was the
      national second line (CQ was the first line) and 2006 when SP was the national
      first line antimalarial treatment. Genetic analysis of SP resistance genes was
      carried out on 1,044 asymptomatic infections and the effect of the two policies
      on SP evolution compared. RESULTS: The frequency of the most resistant allele,
      the double dhps-triple dhfr mutant genotype, increased by only 1% during 17 years
      of SP second line use, but there was a dramatic increase by 45% during five years
      of SP first line use. CONCLUSION: We conclude that National policy change from
      second line to first line SP, brought about an immediate shift in treatment
      practice and this in turn had a highly significant impact on drug pressure. The
      use of SP in specific programs only such as intermittent preventive treatment of 
      infants (IPTi) and intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women (IPTp)
      will most likely reduce substantially SP selection pressure and the SP resistance
      alleles alike.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum: effect of antimalarial drugs, malaria pigment
      (beta-haematin) and Plasmodium falciparum lysate on monocyte GTP-cyclohydrolase 1
      gene expression.
PG  - 312-7
LID - 10.1016/j.exppara.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - In interferon-gamma activated human macrophages, GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 catalyses
      the conversion of guanosine triphosphate to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate,
      which is dephosphorylated and oxidized to form neopterin. Elevated levels of
      neopterin have been detected in the urine and serum of malaria-infected patients.
      In this study, U937 cells were treated with interferon-gamma and one of the
      following antimalarial drugs: amodiaquine, artemisinin, chloroquine, doxycycline,
      primaquine, pyrimethamine or quinine. The effects of treating the U937 cells with
      malaria pigment (beta-haematin), latex beads, or Plasmodium
      falciparum-infected-red blood cell lysates were also investigated. U937
      GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 mRNA expression was monitored using
      reverse-transcriptase-quantitative PCR. Artemisinin, primaquine, and quinine
      down-regulated GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 gene expression 1.26-, 1.29-, and 1.63-fold, 
      respectively. The remaining drugs had insignificant effects. beta-haematin
      up-regulated GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 mRNA expression 1.18-fold, whereas P.
      falciparum-infected red blood cell lysate down-regulated expression 1.56-fold.
      These results show the differing immunomodulatory actions of antimalarial drugs
      and malaria pigment taking place in monocytes.

AB  - Naturally acquired blood-stage infections of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
      falciparum typically harbour multiple haploid clones. The apparent number of
      clones observed in any single infection depends on the diversity of the
      polymorphic markers used for the analysis, and the relative abundance of rare
      clones, which frequently fail to be detected among PCR products derived from
      numerically dominant clones. However, minority clones are of clinical interest as
      they may harbour genes conferring drug resistance, leading to enhanced survival
      after treatment and the possibility of subsequent therapeutic failure. We
      deployed new generation sequencing to derive genome data for five non-propagated 
      parasite isolates taken directly from 4 different patients treated for clinical
      malaria in a UK hospital. Analysis of depth of coverage and length of sequence
      intervals between paired reads identified both previously described and novel
      gene deletions and amplifications. Full-length sequence data was extracted for 6 
      loci considered to be under selection by antimalarial drugs, and both known and
      previously unknown amino acid substitutions were identified. Full mitochondrial
      genomes were extracted from the sequencing data for each isolate, and these are
      compared against a panel of polymorphic sites derived from published or
      unpublished but publicly available data. Finally, genome-wide analysis of clone
      multiplicity was performed, and the number of infecting parasite clones estimated
      for each isolate. Each patient harboured at least 3 clones of P. falciparum by
      this analysis, consistent with results obtained with conventional PCR analysis of
      polymorphic merozoite antigen loci. We conclude that genome sequencing of
      peripheral blood P. falciparum taken directly from malaria patients provides high
      quality data useful for drug resistance studies, genomic structural analyses and 
      population genetics, and also robustly represents clonal multiplicity.

TI  - Repeated treatment of recurrent uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      Senegal with fixed-dose artesunate plus amodiaquine versus fixed-dose artemether 
      plus lumefantrine: a randomized, open-label trial.
PG  - 237
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently
      recommended for treating uncomplicated malaria. The objective was to assess the
      efficacy and safety of repeated administrations of two fixed-dose presentations
      of ACT--artesunate plus amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL)--in
      subsequent episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. METHODS: A randomized
      comparative study was conducted in a rural community of central Senegal from
      August 2007 to January 2009. Children and adults with uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria were randomized to receive open-label ASAQ once daily or AL twice daily
      for three days. Drug doses were given according to body weight. Treatments for
      first episodes were supervised. For subsequent episodes, only the first intake of
      study drug was supervised. ECGs and audiograms were performed in patients >/= 12 
      years of age. Primary outcome was adequate clinical and parasitological response 
      rate (ACPR) after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) correction on day 28 for the
      first episode. RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were enrolled in the two groups
      (ASAQ 184, AL 182) and followed up during two malaria transmission seasons. In
      the intent-to-treat population, PCR-corrected ACPRs at day 28 for the first
      episode were 98.4% and 96.2%, respectively, in the ASAQ and AL groups. For the
      per-protocol population (ASAQ 183, AL 182), PCR-corrected ACPRs at day 28 for the
      first episode were 98.9% and 96.7%, respectively. A 100% ACPR rate was obtained
      at day 28 in the 60 and four patients, respectively, who experienced second and
      third episodes. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 11.7% of the
      patients, without significant differences between the two groups. A better
      improvement of haemoglobin at day 28 was noted in the ASAQ versus the AL group
      (12.2 versus 11.8 g/dL; p = 0.03). No sign of ototoxicity was demonstrated. A
      prolongation of the QTc interval was observed in both groups during treatment
      with no clinical consequence. CONCLUSIONS: Study results confirmed the
      satisfactory efficacy and safety profile of ASAQ and AL. Moreover, in patients
      who were treated at least twice, repeated administration of ASAQ or AL did not
      identify any major safety issues. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

PG  - 229
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-229 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frozen blood clots remaining after serum collection is an often
      disregarded source of host and pathogen DNA due to troublesome handling and
      suboptimal outcome. METHODS: High-speed shaking of clot samples in a cell
      disruptor manufactured for homogenization of tissue and faecal specimens was
      evaluated for processing frozen blood clots for DNA extraction. The method was
      compared to two commercial clot protocols based on a chemical kit and
      centrifugation through a plastic sieve, followed by the same DNA extraction
      protocol. Blood clots with different levels of parasitaemia (1-1,000 p/mul) were 
      prepared from parasite cultures to assess sensitivity of PCR detection. In
      addition, clots retrieved from serum samples collected within two epidemiological
      studies in Kenya (n = 630) were processed by high speed shaking and analysed by
      PCR for detection of malaria parasites and the human alpha-thalassaemia gene.
      RESULTS: High speed shaking succeeded in fully dispersing the clots and the
      method generated the highest DNA yield. The level of PCR detection of P.
      falciparum parasites and the human thalassaemia gene was the same as samples
      optimally collected with an anticoagulant. The commercial clot protocol and
      centrifugation through a sieve failed to fully dissolve the clots and resulted in
      lower sensitivity of PCR detection. CONCLUSIONS: High speed shaking was a simple 
      and efficacious method for homogenizing frozen blood clots before DNA
      purification and resulted in PCR templates of high quality both from humans and
      malaria parasites. This novel method enables genetic studies from stored blood
      clots.

TI  - [Cloning and expression of var2csa DBL domains from Plasmodium falciparum hainan 
      isolate and functional analysis of the recombinant protein].
PG  - 37-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone and express three VAR2CSA duffy antigen-binding ligand (DBL) 
      domains (DBL4/ 5/6) encoded by var2csa gene of a Hainan isolate of Plasmodium
      falciparum, and study the difference of chondroitin sulfate A (CSA)-binding
      activity among them. METHODS: Three DBL domains was amplified by PCR and cloned
      into the vector pMD18-T. The recombinant plasmids were identified by enzyme
      digestion and sequencing, and then subcloned into the prokaryotic expression
      vector pET-22b. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)
      and followed by expression of the protein induced by IPTG. The recombinant
      protein was purified with His GraciTrap kit and identified by SDS-PAGE and
      Western blotting. CSA-binding activity of the three recombinant DBL domains was
      assayed by ELISA. RESULTS: The target genes were amplified with the length of 996
      bp, 859 bp and 894 bp. The constructed recombinant plasmids were identified by
      enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The recombinant proteins (DBL4/5/6) were
      purified, the relative molecular mass of DBLfA, DBL5 and DBL6 was Mr 439 800, Mr 
      34,500 and Mr 36,000, respectively. The purified protein has been confirmed with 
      immunogenicity by Western blotting. The results of adhesion experiment indicated 
      that A405 values of DBL5 domain with different concentration were significantly
      higher than that of DBLA and DBL6. CONCLUSION: The three recombinant proteins
      (DBLA/5/6) of VAR2CSA DBL domains were expressed, and DBL5 domain has high
      binding affinity with CSA.

TI  - Detection of high levels of mutations involved in anti-malarial drug resistance
      in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax at a rural hospital in southern
      Ethiopia.
PG  - 214
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax, and anti-malarial drug resistance is the most pressing problem 
      confronting control of the disease. Since co-infection by both species of
      parasite is common and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been intensively used,
      resistance to these drugs has appeared in both P. falciparum and P. vivax
      populations. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of anti-malarial
      drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax isolates collected at a rural
      hospital in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 1,147 patients with suspected 
      malaria were studied in different months across the period 2007-2009. Plasmodium 
      falciparum dhfr and dhps mutations and P. vivax dhfr polymorphisms associated
      with resistance to SP, as well as P. falciparum pfcrt and pfmdr1 mutations
      conferring chloroquine resistance, were assessed. RESULTS: PCR-based diagnosis
      showed that 125 of the 1147 patients had malaria. Of these, 52.8% and 37.6% of
      cases were due to P. falciparum and P. vivax respectively. A total of 10 cases
      (8%) showed co-infection by both species and two cases (1.6%) were infected by
      Plasmodium ovale. Pfdhfr triple mutation and pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutation
      occurred in 90.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.2%-95.5%) and 82.9% (95% CI: 
      72.9%-89.7%) of P. falciparum isolates, respectively. Pfcrt T76 was observed in
      all cases and pfmdr1 Y86 and pfmdr1 Y1246 in 32.9% (95% CI: 23.4%-44.15%) and
      17.1% (95% CI: 10.3-27.1%), respectively. The P. vivax dhfr core mutations, N117 
      and R58, were present in 98.2% (95% CI: 89.4-99.9%) and 91.2% (95% CI:
      80.0-96.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Current molecular data show an
      extraordinarily high frequency of drug-resistance mutations in both P. falciparum
      and P. vivax in southern Ethiopia. Urgent surveillance of the emergence and
      spread of resistance is thus called for. The level of resistance indicates the
      need for implementation of entire population access to the new first-line
      treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, accompanied by government monitoring to
      prevent the emergence of resistance to this treatment.

TI  - Allelic diversity of merozoite surface protein 2 gene of P falciparum among
      children in Osogbo, Nigeria.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum) infections in
      humans is implicated in the pathogenesis of malaria. This study provides the
      first estimate of the genetic diversity and genotype multiplicity of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection in children with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in
      Osogbo, Nigeria. One hundred and one isolates were used for analysis of parasite 
      population polymorphism and genotyped by nested-PCR of merozoite surface protein 
      2 (MSP2) block 3. Amplicons were obtained for all the 101 genotyped samples in
      MSP2 PCR with 9 alleles varying in size between 300 and 800 base pair.
      Thirty-three (31.7%) samples had FC27 allele while 27 (26.7%) had 3D7 allele and 
      35 (34.7%) had mixed alleles (3D7+FC27). The Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) in
      the population was 1.6. Children in the age group of > 4-8 years had the highest 
      number of different genotypes in their samples (1.8). The number of MSP2 bands
      per isolate was lower in the older age group (1.3) but the difference was not
      statistically significant. Children with parasite density range 5001-10 000 had
      the highest MOI of 2 while those with parasite density range 1000-5000 had the
      lowest of 1.5. In conclusion, the present study shows that the field isolates are
      highly diverse in respect of MSP2 and multiplicity of infection was neither age
      nor parasite density dependent in the study population.

      different stages and strains: implications for rapid diagnostic tests.
PG  - e22593
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0022593 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum
      infection that target histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) are generally sensitive, 
      their performance has been reported to be variable. One possible explanation for 
      variable test performance is differences in expression level of PfHRP in
      different parasite isolates. METHODS: Total RNA and protein were extracted from
      synchronised cultures of 7 P. falciparum lines over 5 time points of the life
      cycle, and from synchronised ring stages of 10 falciparum lines. Using
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis and ELISA
      we investigated variations in the transcription and protein levels of pfhrp2,
      pfhrp3 and PfHRP respectively in the different parasite lines, over the parasite 
      intraerythrocytic life cycle. RESULTS: Transcription of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 in
      different parasite lines over the parasite life cycle was observed to vary
      relative to the control parasite K1. In some parasite lines very low
      transcription of these genes was observed. The peak transcription was observed in
      ring-stage parasites. Pfhrp2 transcription was observed to be consistently higher
      than pfhrp3 transcription within parasite lines. The intraerythrocytic lifecycle 
      stage at which the peak level of protein was present varied across strains. Total
      protein levels were more constant relative to total mRNA transcription, however a
      maximum 24 fold difference in expression at ring-stage parasites relative to the 
      K1 strain was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of transcription of pfhrp2 and
      pfhrp3, and protein expression of PfHRP varied between different P. falciparum
      strains. This variation may impact on the detection sensitivity of
      PfHRP2-detecting RDTs.

      falciparum malaria in Central Ethiopia.
PG  - 209
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vivo efficacy assessments of the first-line treatments for
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria are essential for ensuring effective case
      management. In Ethiopia, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) has been the first-line
      treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria since 2004. METHODS: Between
      October and November 2009, we conducted a 42-day, single arm, open label study of
      AL for P. falciparum in individuals >6 months of age at two sites in Oromia
      State, Ethiopia. Eligible patients who had documented P. falciparum
      mono-infection were enrolled and followed according to the standard 2009 World
      Health Organization in vivo drug efficacy monitoring protocol. The primary and
      secondary endpoints were PCR uncorrected and corrected cure rates, as measured by
      adequate clinical and parasitological response on days 28 and 42, respectively.
      RESULTS: Of 4426 patients tested, 120 with confirmed falciparum malaria were
      enrolled and treated with AL. Follow-up was completed for 112 patients at day 28 
      and 104 patients at day 42. There was one late parasitological failure, which was
      classified as undetermined after genotyping. Uncorrected cure rates at both day
      28 and 42 for the per protocol analysis were 99.1% (95% CI 95.1-100.0); corrected
      cure rates at both day 28 and 42 were 100.0%. Uncorrected cure rates at day 28
      and 42 for the intention to treat analysis were 93.3% (95% CI 87.2-97.1) and
      86.6% (95% CI 79.1-92.1), respectively, while the corrected cure rates at day 28 
      and 42 were 94.1% (95% CI 88.2-97.6) and 87.3% (95% CI 79.9-92.7), respectively. 
      Using survival analysis, the unadjusted cure rate was 99.1% and 100.0% adjusted
      by genotyping for day 28 and 42, respectively. Eight P. falciparum patients
      (6.7%) presented with Plasmodium vivax infection during follow-up and were
      excluded from the per protocol analysis. Only one patient had persistent
      parasitaemia at day 3. No serious adverse events were reported, with cough and
      nausea/vomiting being the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: AL remains a
      highly effective and well-tolerated treatment for uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria in the study setting after several years of universal access to AL. A
      high rate of parasitaemia with P. vivax possibly from relapse or new infection
      was observed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01052584.

TI  - Surveillance of vector populations and malaria transmission during the 2009/10 El
      Nino event in the western Kenya highlands: opportunities for early detection of
      malaria hyper-transmission.
PG  - 144
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-4-144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector control in the highlands of western Kenya has resulted in a
      significant reduction of malaria transmission and a change in the vectorial
      system. Climate variability as a result of events such as El Nino increases the
      highlands suitability for malaria transmission. Surveillance and monitoring is an
      important component of early transmission risk identification and management.
      However, below certain disease transmission thresholds, traditional tools for
      surveillance such as entomological inoculation rates may become insensitive. A
      rapid diagnostic kit comprising Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite surface
      protein and merozoite surface protein antibodies in humans was tested for early
      detection of transmission surges in the western Kenya highlands during an El Nino
      event (October 2009-February 2010). METHODS: Indoor resting female adult malaria 
      vectors were collected in western Kenya highlands in four selected villages
      categorized into two valley systems, the U-shaped (Iguhu and Emutete) and the
      V-shaped valleys (Marani and Fort Ternan) for eight months. Members of the
      Anopheles gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Blood samples were collected
      from children 6-15 years old and exposure to malaria was tested using a
      circum-sporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein immunchromatographic
      rapid diagnostic test kit. Sporozoite ELISA was conducted to detect
      circum-sporozoite protein, later used for estimation of entomological inoculation
      rates. RESULTS: Among the four villages studied, an upsurge in antibody levels
      was first observed in October 2009. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites were then
      first observed in December 2009 at Iguhu village and February 2010 at Emutete.
      Despite the upsurge in Marani and Fort Ternan no sporozoites were detected
      throughout the eight month study period. The antibody-based assay had much
      earlier transmission detection ability than the sporozoite-based assay. The
      proportion of An. arabiensis among An. gambiae s.l. ranged from 2.9-66.7%
      indicating a rearrangement of the sibling species of the An. gambiae s.l complex.
      This is possibly an adaptation to insecticide interventions and climate change.
      CONCLUSION: The changing malaria transmission rates in the western Kenya
      highlands will lead to more unstable transmission, decreased immunity and a high 
      vulnerability to epidemics unless surveillance tools are improved and effective
      vector control is sustained.

      in vitro sensitivity in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Thai-Myanmar
      border.
PG  - 130-5
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.07.003 [doi]
AB  - The association between pfatp6, pfmdr1 polymorphisms (gene mutation and
      amplification) and in vitro susceptibility to mefloquine (MQ), artesunate (AS),
      quinine (QN), and chloroquine (CQ) was investigated in a total of sixty-three
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from the Thai-Myanmar border. The
      mutations of pfatp6 at codons R37K, G639D, S769N, and I898I and of pfmdr1 at
      codons N86Y, Y184F, N1042D, and D1246Y were analyzed by polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Pfatp6 and pfmdr1
      gene copy numbers were analyzed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro susceptibility test was successful in 58
      culture-adapted isolates. Median (range) IC(50) values for MQ, AS, QN, and CQ
      were 28.96 (3.4-100.5), 1.74 (0.8-5.57), 223.9 (14.99-845.47), and 69.93
      (9.6-183.18) nM, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation (R(2)
      = 0.58) of parasite susceptibility to MQ, AS, and QN. Twelve isolates showed
      marked decline in susceptibility to AS [median (range) IC(50) = 3.78 (3.07-5.57) 
      nM]. Almost all isolates carried wild-type pfatp6 and pfmdr1 alleles at the
      investigated codons, while only three isolates (5%) carried pfmdr1 mutation
      alleles at codon 86. Mutation at codon 86 was associated with a significant
      increase in the susceptibility of parasite isolates to MQ and QN. All of the
      sixty-three isolates carried only one pfatp6 copy number. Thirty-three out of the
      58 isolates showed increase in pfmdr1 gene copies, which was associated with
      reduced in vitro susceptibility to MQ, AS, and QN. No association between
      mutation or amplification of pfatp6 gene and in vitro susceptibility of P.
      falciparum isolates was found.

      large Tanzanian cohort.
PG  - 3245-9
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00940-11 [doi]
AB  - Relapsing fever (RF) is caused by tick- and louse-borne Borrelia spp., is
      characterized by recurrent fever, and is often misdiagnosed as malaria. Because
      of submicroscopic bacteremia, microscopy can be insensitive between febrile
      bouts. We designed a multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to distinguish RF
      Borrelia from Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. The assay specifically (100%)
      amplified pathogenic RF Borrelia (1 copy/reaction). We then tested blood from
      participants within a Tanzanian cohort assessed at scheduled intervals and with
      fever. Among 8,617 blood samples from 2,057 participants surveyed routinely, 7
      (0.08%) samples and 7 (0.3%) participants had RF DNA (median, 4.4 x 10(3)
      copies/ml). Of 382 samples from 310 febrile persons, 15 (3.9%) samples from 13
      (4.2%) participants had RF DNA (median, 7.9 x 10(2) copies/ml). Five (1.3%)
      samples from 4 (1.3%) participants were found to harbor Borrelia by microscopy.
      We conclude that multiplex qPCR holds promise for improved clinical diagnosis and
      epidemiologic assessment of RF.

TI  - Multicentric assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine compared to artemether-lumefantrine in the
      treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The choice of appropriate artemisinin-based combination therapy
      depends on several factors (cost, efficacy, safety, reinfection rate and
      simplicity of administration). To assess whether the combination
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) could be an alternative to
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the efficacy and the tolerability of the two
      products for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan
      Africa have been compared. METHODS: A multicentric open randomized controlled
      clinical trial of three-day treatment of DP against AL for the treatment of two
      parallel groups of patients aged two years and above and suffering from
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria was carried out in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and
      Senegal. Within each group, patients were randomly assigned supervised treatment.
      DP was given once a day for three days and AL twice a day for three days.
      Follow-up visits were performed on day 1 to 4 and on day 7, 14, 21, 28 to
      evaluate clinical and parasitological results. The primary endpoint was the
      recovery rate by day 28. RESULTS: Of 384 patients enrolled, 197 were assigned DP 
      and 187 AL. The recovery rates adjusted by genotyping, 99.5% in the DP group and 
      98.9% in the AL group, were not statistically different (p=0.538). No Early
      Therapeutic Failure (ETF) was observed. At day 28, two patients in the DP group
      and five in AL group had recurrent parasitaemia with Plasmodium falciparum. In
      the DP group, after PCR genotyping, one of the two recurrences was classified as 
      a new infection and the other as recrudescence. In AL group, two recurrences were
      classified after correction by PCR as recrudescence. All cases of recrudescence
      were classified as Late Parasitological Failure (LPF). In each group, a rapid
      recovery from fever and parasitaemia was noticed. More than 90% of patients did
      no longer present fever or parasitaemia 48 hours after treatment. Both drugs were
      well tolerated. Indeed, no serious adverse events were reported during the
      follow-up period. Most of the adverse events which developed were moderate and
      did not result in the treatment being stopped in either treatment group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was as effective and well-tolerated
      as artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. 
      In addition, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, a single daily dose, could be an
      advantage over artemether-lumefantrine in Africa because of better treatment
      observance.

TI  - Molecular markers of resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine during intermittent
      preventive treatment of pregnant women in Benin.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevention of malaria faces with the repeated emergence of
      Plasmodium falciparum resistance to drugs, often involving point mutations of the
      target gene. In the pregnant woman, currently the WHO recommendation is the
      administration of an intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance has
      increased for several years in Africa, stressing the need for alternative
      molecules. In this context, the first randomized clinical trial comparing the
      efficacy of SP and mefloquine for IPTp has been conducted recently in Benin.
      Using samples from this trial, the current study evaluated and quantified the
      prevalence of mutations on the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes as well as the copy number
      of the pfmdr1 gene in parasites from P. falciparum-infected pregnant women before
      first and second IPTp administration, and at delivery. METHODS: PCR-restriction
      fragment length polymorphism of polymorphic codons of the pfdhfr gene (51, 59,
      108, and 164) was performed. The identification of mutations in three codons of
      the pfdhps gene (436, 437 and 540) was achieved by PCR and sequencing. Copy
      number quantification for pfmdr1 gene was performed using real-time PCR. RESULTS:
      Results show a high prevalence rate of mutant parasites in women taking IPTp with
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine or mefloquine. The prevalence of triple and quadruple 
      mutants was high before first drug regimen administration (79/93, 85%), and
      remained similar until delivery. Infection with mutant parasites was not
      correlated with low birth weight nor placental infection. In all samples, the
      copy number of pfmdr1 gene was equal to one. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trial
      comparing SP and mefloquine efficacy during IPTp showed SP remained efficacious
      in preventing low birth weight. The present study shows a high prevalence of
      triple and quadruple mutations implicated in SP resistance. Although the
      pfdhfr/pfdhps triple and quadruple mutations were frequent, there was no evidence
      of correlation between these genotypes and the lack of efficacy of SP in the
      context of IPTp. Nevertheless, it is now obvious that SP will soon be compromised
      in whole Africa. Molecular markers have been recommended to monitor SP efficacy
      for IPTp, but given the current prevalence of mutant parasites their usefulness
      is questionable.

TI  - False positive circumsporozoite protein ELISA: a challenge for the estimation of 
      the entomological inoculation rate of malaria and for vector incrimination.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) is an important indicator in
      estimating malaria transmission and the impact of vector control. To assess the
      EIR, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the circumsporozoite
      protein (CSP) is increasingly used. However, several studies have reported false 
      positive results in this ELISA. The false positive results could lead to an
      overestimation of the EIR. The aim of present study was to estimate the level of 
      false positivity among different anopheline species in Cambodia and Vietnam and
      to check for the presence of other parasites that might interact with the
      anti-CSP monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: Mosquitoes collected in Cambodia and
      Vietnam were identified and tested for the presence of sporozoites in head and
      thorax by using CSP-ELISA. ELISA positive samples were confirmed by a Plasmodium 
      specific PCR. False positive mosquitoes were checked by PCR for the presence of
      parasites belonging to the Haemosporidia, Trypanosomatidae, Piroplasmida, and
      Haemogregarines. The heat-stability and the presence of the cross-reacting
      antigen in the abdomen of the mosquitoes were also checked. RESULTS: Specimens
      (N=16,160) of seven anopheline species were tested by CSP-ELISA for Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax (Pv210 and Pv247). Two new vector species were
      identified for the region: Anopheles pampanai (P. vivax) and Anopheles
      barbirostris (Plasmodium malariae). In 88% (155/176) of the mosquitoes found
      positive with the P. falciparum CSP-ELISA, the presence of Plasmodium sporozoites
      could not be confirmed by PCR. This percentage was much lower (28% or 5/18) for
      P. vivax CSP-ELISAs. False positive CSP-ELISA results were associated with
      zoophilic mosquito species. None of the targeted parasites could be detected in
      these CSP-ELISA false positive mosquitoes. The ELISA reacting antigen of P.
      falciparum was heat-stable in CSP-ELISA true positive specimens, but not in the
      false positives. The heat-unstable cross-reacting antigen is mainly present in
      head and thorax and almost absent in the abdomens (4 out of 147) of the false
      positive specimens. CONCLUSION: The CSP-ELISA can considerably overestimate the
      EIR, particularly for P. falciparum and for zoophilic species. The heat-unstable 
      cross-reacting antigen in false positives remains unknown. Therefore it is highly
      recommended to confirm all positive CSP-ELISA results, either by re-analysing the
      heated ELISA lysate (100 degrees C, 10 min), or by performing Plasmodium specific
      PCR followed if possible by sequencing of the amplicons for Plasmodium species
      determination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria infection with Plasmodium falciparum is an important basic
      health problem in the tropical and sub-tropical countries. The standard
      diagnostic method is blood film examination to visualize parasite morphology.
      However, in cases of low parasitemia or mixed infection with very low cryptic
      species, microscopy is not sensitive enough. Therefore, molecular techniques have
      been widely employed. METHODS: A label-free DNA biosensor based on quartz crystal
      microbalance (QCM) to diagnose and genotype P. falciparum was developed.
      Avidin-biotin interaction was used to coat the specific biotinylated probe on the
      gold surface of QCM. The gene encoding merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) was
      amplified and the PCR products were then cut with restriction enzyme (MwoI).
      Enzymatic cutting made the PCR products suitable for QCM development.
      Hybridization between probe and enzymatic cutting DNA fragments resulted in
      frequency changes of the QCM. RESULTS: The newly developed QCM was tested for its
      diagnosis ability using both malaria laboratory strains and clinical isolates.
      The biosensor was sensitive at the sub-nanogram level, specific for only P.
      falciparum detection, no cross-reaction with P. vivax, and stable at room
      temperature for up to 6 months. Selection of msp2 as a target gene and a
      geno-typing marker made the QCM potentially useful for falciparum diagnosis
      simultaneously with genotyping. Potency was tested by genotyping two allelic
      families of P. falciparum, FC27 and IC1, using malaria laboratory strains, K1 and
      3D7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dual function QCM was successfully developed 
      with high sensitivity and specificity, and was cost-effective, stable and field
      adaptable.

PG  - 1232-9
LID - 10.3201/eid1707.101551 [doi]
AB  - A single Anopheles dirus mosquito carrying sporozoites of Plasmodium knowlesi, P.
      falciparum, and P. vivax was recently discovered in Khanh Phu, southern Vietnam. 
      Further sampling of humans and mosquitoes in this area during 2009-2010 showed P.
      knowlesi infections in 32 (26%) persons with malaria (n = 125) and in 31 (43%)
      sporozoite-positive An. dirus mosquitoes (n = 73). Co-infections of P. knowlesi
      and P. vivax were predominant in mosquitoes and humans, while single P. knowlesi 
      infections were found only in mosquitoes. P. knowlesi-co-infected patients were
      largely asymptomatic and were concentrated among ethnic minority families who
      commonly spend nights in the forest. P. knowlesi carriers were significantly
      younger than those infected with other malaria parasite species. These results
      imply that even if human malaria could be eliminated, forests that harbor An.
      dirus mosquitoes and macaque monkeys will remain a reservoir for the zoonotic
      transmission of P. knowlesi.

TI  - Comparative study of the efficacy and tolerability of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim versus artemether-lumefantrine in the
      treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cameroon, Ivory Coast
      and Senegal.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-185 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ACT recommended by WHO is very effective and well-tolerated.
      However, these combinations need to be administered for three days, which may
      limit adherence to treatment.The combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      phosphate-trimethoprim (Artecom(R), Odypharm Ltd), which involves treatment over 
      two days, appears to be a good alternative, particularly in malaria-endemic
      areas. This study intends to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the
      combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine phosphate-trimethoprim (DPT) versus
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal. METHODS: This was a
      randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with a 28-day follow-up period 
      comparing DPT to AL as the reference drug. The study involved patients of at
      least two years of age, suffering from acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria with fever. The WHO 2003 protocol was used. RESULTS: A total of 418
      patients were included in the study and divided into two treatment groups: 212 in
      the DPT group and 206 in the AL group. The data analysis involved the 403
      subjects who correctly followed the protocol (per protocol analysis), i.e. 206
      (51.1%) in the DPT group and 197 (48.9%) in the AL group. The recovery rate at
      D14 was 100% in both treatment groups. The recovery rate at D28 was 99% in the
      DPT and AL groups before and after PCR results with one-sided 97.5% Confidence
      Interval of the rates difference > -1.90%. More than 96% of patients who received
      DPT were apyrexial 48 hours after treatment compared to 83.5% in the AL group (p 
      < 0.001). More than 95% of the people in the DPT group had a parasite clearance
      time of 48 hours or less compared to approximately 90% in the AL group (p =
      0.023). Both drugs were well tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported
      during the follow-up period. All of the adverse events observed were minor and
      did not result in the treatment being stopped in either treatment group. The main
      minor adverse events reported were vomiting, abdominal pain and pruritus.
      CONCLUSION: The overall efficacy and tolerability of DPT are similar to those of 
      AL. The ease of taking DPT and its short treatment course (two days) may help to 
      improve adherence to treatment. Taken together, these findings make this
      medicinal product a treatment of choice for the effective management of malaria
      in Africa.

AB  - Antigenic variation to fool the immune system is one of the molecular tricks
      Plasmodium uses to maintain infection in its human host. The exclusive expression
      of the surface-exposed PfEMP1 molecules, encoded by var genes, is the best
      example for this. Central questions regarding the dynamics of antigenic
      variation, namely the rate of switching and the regulation of var gene expression
      in Plasmodium falciparum, are yet unanswered. To elucidate the in vivo situation,
      we studied var gene switching by analysing the var transcripts from parasites
      isolated from 20 non-immune malaria patients as well as during subsequent in
      vitro generations. Parasites were found to be highly co-ordinated as the whole
      population isolated from individual patients usually expressed only one dominant 
      - preferentially group A -var gene. While some isolates have very low switching
      rates, others switched their var gene expression in every generation. However,
      during extended cultivation the co-ordinated expression and switching is lost
      resulting in random expression of all var gene groups. Switching as observed on
      the RNA level was also supported on the protein level using PfEMP1-specific
      antibodies. The results suggest that var genes switch in an ordered, hierarchical
      manner at much higher rates than previously described.

AB  - We compared light microscopy examination and a semi-nested multiplex PCR
      (SnM-PCR) assay in endemic areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran. A total of 68
      individuals with malaria-positive and suspected malaria symptoms were included in
      the study. Giemsa-stained thick blood films were examined under a light
      microscope for malaria parasites in 100 and 200 fields. DNA was extracted from
      blood samples and SnM-PCR based on the amplification of the small sub-unit
      ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene sequences was applied. Microscopical examination
      showed that 48.5% (33.8% P. vivax and 14.7% P.falciparum) and 50% (35.3% P. vivax
      and 14.7% P. falciparum) of the samples were positive in 100 and 200 fields
      respectively. SnM-PCR showed the same results as the 200 field microscopy.

TI  - Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in
      endemic countries.
PG  - CD008122
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria use
      antibodies to detect either HRP-2 antigen or pLDH antigen, and can improve access
      to diagnostics in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic
      accuracy of RDTs for detecting P. falciparum parasitaemia in persons living in
      endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms
      suggestive of malaria by type and brand. SEARCH STRATEGY: We undertook a
      comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases
      Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web 
      of Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; IndMED; to January 14, 2010.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy 
      or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive
      series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms
      suggestive of malaria in P. falciparum endemic areas. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: For each study, a standard set of data was extracted independently by
      two authors, using a tailored data extraction form. Comparisons were grouped
      hierarchically by target antigen, and type and brand of RDT, and combined in
      meta-analysis where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 74 unique studies as
      eligible for this review and categorized them according to the antigens they
      detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) either by itself or
      with other antigens. Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either by
      itself or with other antigens. In comparisons with microscopy, we identified 71
      evaluations of Type 1 tests, eight evaluations of Type 2 tests and five
      evaluations of Type 3 tests. In meta-analyses, average sensitivities and
      specificities (95% CI) were 94.8% (93.1% to 96.1%) and 95.2% (93.2% to 96.7%) for
      Type 1 tests, 96.0% (94.0% to 97.3%) and 95.3% (87.3% to 98.3%) for Type 2 tests,
      and 99.5% (71.0% to 100.0%) and 90.6% (80.5% to 95.7%) for Type 3 tests,
      respectively. Overall for HRP-2, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and
      specificity (95% CI) were 95.0% (93.5% to 96.2%) and 95.2% (93.4% to 99.4%),
      respectively. For pLDH antibody-based RDTs verified with microscopy, we
      identified 17 evaluations of Type 4 RDTs and three evaluations of Type 5 RDTs. In
      meta-analyses, average sensitivity for Type 4 tests was 91.5% (84.7% to 95.3%)
      and average specificity was 98.7% (96.9% to 99.5%). For Type 5 tests, average
      sensitivity was 98.4% (95.1% to 99.5%) and average specificity was 97.5% (93.5%
      to 99.1%). Overall for pLDH, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and
      specificity (95% CI) were 93.2% (88.0% to 96.2%) and 98.5% (96.7% to 99.4%),
      respectively. For both categories of test, there was substantial heterogeneity in
      study results. Quality of the microscopy reference standard could only be
      assessed in 40% of studies due to inadequate reporting, but results did not seem 
      to be influenced by the reporting quality.Overall, HRP-2 antibody-based tests
      (such as the Type 1 tests) tended to be more sensitive and were significantly
      less specific than pLDH-based tests (such as the Type 4 tests). If the point
      estimates for Type 1 and Type 4 tests are applied to a hypothetical cohort of
      1000 patients where 30% of those presenting with symptoms have P. falciparum,
      Type 1 tests will miss 16 cases, and Type 4 tests will miss 26 cases. The number 
      of people wrongly diagnosed with P. falciparum would be 34 with Type 1 tests, and
      nine with Type 4 tests. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of 
      all RDTs is such that they can replace or extend the access of diagnostic
      services for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. HRP-2 antibody types may be
      more sensitive but are less specific than pLDH antibody-based tests, but the
      differences are small. The HRP-2 antigen persists even after effective treatment 
      and so is not useful for detecting treatment failures.

AB  - Pregnant women are at increased risk of malaria, but in Angola, epidemiologic
      data from this group is almost inexistent. We conducted a cross-sectional study
      to determine the prevalence and risk factors of Plasmodium falciparum infections 
      in 567 pregnant Angolan women living in Luanda province. One in five women had P.
      falciparum at delivery, diagnosed by PCR assay. Age, residence and history of
      malaria during pregnancy were significantly associated with P. falciparum
      infection, but gravidity and use of anti-malarial drugs were not. Placental
      infections were significantly more common in women </=18 years old and in
      primigravidae, but we could not correlate placental infections with poor
      pregnancy outcomes. These findings are relevant to malaria control policies in
      Luanda, Angola.

TI  - Linear amplification for deep sequencing.
PG  - 1026-36
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2011.345 [doi]
AB  - Linear amplification for deep sequencing (LADS) is an amplification method that
      produces representative libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing within 
      2 d. The method relies on attaching two different sequencing adapters to
      blunt-end repaired and A-tailed DNA fragments, wherein one of the adapters is
      extended with the sequence for the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Ligated and
      size-selected DNA fragments are transcribed in vitro with high RNA yields.
      Subsequent cDNA synthesis is initiated from a primer complementary to the first
      adapter, ensuring that the library will only contain full-length fragments with
      two distinct adapters. Contrary to the severely biased representation of AT- or
      GC-rich fragments in standard PCR-amplified libraries, the sequence coverage in
      T7-amplified libraries is indistinguishable from that of nonamplified libraries. 
      Moreover, in contrast to amplification-free methods, LADS can generate sequencing
      libraries from a few nanograms of DNA, which is essential for all applications in
      which the starting material is limited.

TI  - Gestational malaria associated to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum
      placental mixed-infection followed by foetal loss: a case report from an unstable
      transmission area in Brazil.
PG  - 178
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-178 [doi]
AB  - Gestational malaria is a multi-factorial syndrome leading to poor outcomes for
      both the mother and foetus. Although an unusual increasing in the number of
      hospitalizations caused by Plasmodium vivax has been reported in Brazil,
      mortality is rarely observed. This is a report of a gestational malaria case that
      occurred in the city of Manaus (Amazonas State, Brazil) and resulted in foetal
      loss. The patient presented placental mixed-infection by Plasmodium vivax and
      Plasmodium falciparum after diagnosis by nested-PCR, however microscopic analysis
      failed to detect P. falciparum in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, as the
      patient did not receive proper treatment for P. falciparum and hospitalization
      occurred soon after drug treatment, it seems that P. falciparum pathology was
      modulated by the concurrent presence of P. vivax. Collectively, this case
      confirms the tropism towards the placenta by both of these species of parasites, 
      reinforces the notion that co-existence of distinct malaria parasites interferes 
      on diseases' outcomes, and opens discussions regarding diagnostic methods,
      malaria treatment during pregnancy and prenatal care for women living in unstable
      transmission areas of malaria, such as the Brazilian Amazon.

      expression in response to diet and infection with Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - 303-12
LID - 10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.06.005 [doi]
AB  - Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) regulate a multitude of biological processes,
      including metabolism and immunity to infection, and share similar structural
      motifs across widely divergent taxa. Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling
      (IIS) pathway elements are similarly conserved. We have shown that IIS regulates 
      reproduction, innate immunity, and lifespan in female Anopheles stephensi, a
      major mosquito vector of human malaria. To further explore IIS regulation of
      these processes, we identified genes encoding five ILPs in this species and
      characterized their expression in tissues. Antisera to ILP homologs in Anopheles 
      gambiae were used to identify cellular sources in An. stephensi females by
      immunocytochemistry. We analyzed tissue-specific ILP transcript expression in
      young and older females, in response to different feeding regimens, and in
      response to infection with Plasmodiumfalciparum with quantitative reverse
      transcriptase-PCR assays. While some ILP transcript changes were evident in older
      females and in response to blood feeding, significant changes were particularly
      notable in response to hormonal concentrations of ingested human insulin and to
      P. falciparum infection. These changes suggest that ILP secretion and action may 
      be similarly responsive in Plasmodium-infected females and potentially alter
      metabolism and innate immunity.

TI  - Real-time PCR assay and rapid diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of clinically
      suspected malaria patients in Bangladesh.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 95% of total malaria cases in Bangladesh are reported from 
      the 13 high endemic districts. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the
      two most abundant malaria parasites in the country. To improve the detection and 
      management of malaria patients, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) has
      been using rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in the endemic areas. A study was
      conducted to establish a SYBR Green-based modified real-time PCR assay as a gold 
      standard to evaluate the performance of four commercially-available malaria RDTs,
      along with the classical gold standard- microscopy. METHODS: Blood samples were
      collected from 338 febrile patients referred for the diagnosis of malaria by the 
      attending physician at MatirangaUpazila Health Complex (UHC) from May 2009 to
      August 2010. Paracheck RDT and microscopy were performed at the UHC. The blood
      samples were preserved in EDTA tubes. A SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assay was 
      performed and evaluated. The performances of the remaining three RDTs (Falcivax, 
      Onsite Pf and Onsite Pf/Pv) were also evaluated against microscopy and real-time 
      PCR using the stored blood samples. RESULT: In total, 338 febrile patients were
      enrolled in the study. Malaria parasites were detected in 189 (55.9%) and 188
      (55.6%) patients by microscopy and real-time PCR respectively. Among the RDTs,
      the highest sensitivity for the detection of P. falciparum (including mixed
      infection) was obtained by Paracheck [98.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      95.8-99.9] and Falcivax (97.6%, 95% CI 94.1-99.4) compared to microscopy and
      real-time PCR respectively. Paracheck and Onsite Pf/Pv gave the highest
      specificity (98.8%, 95% CI 95.7-99.9) compared to microscopy and Onsite Pf/Pv
      (98.8, 95% CI 95.8-99.9) compared to real-time PCR respectively for the detection
      of P. falciparum. On the other hand Falcivax and Onsite Pf/Pv had equal
      sensitivity (90.5%, 95% CI 69.6-98.8) and almost 100% specificity compared to
      microscopy for the detection of P. vivax. However, compared to real-time PCR
      assay RDTs and microscopy gave low sensitivity (76.9%, 95% CI 56.4-91) in
      detecting of P. vivax although a very high specificity was obtained (99-100%).
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the SYBR Green-based real-time
      PCR assay could be used as an alternative gold standard method in a reference
      setting. Commercially-available RDTs used in the study are quite sensitive and
      specific in detecting P. falciparum, although their sensitivity in detecting P.
      vivax was not satisfactory compared to the real-time PCR assay.

TI  - Clinical trial of extended-dose chloroquine for treatment of resistant falciparum
      malaria among Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falciparum malaria is a significant problem for Afghan refugees in
      Pakistan. Refugee treatment guidelines recommended standard three-day chloroquine
      treatment (25 mg/kg) for first episodes and extended five-day treatment (40
      mg/kg) for recrudescent infections, based on the assumption that a five-day
      course would more likely achieve a cure. An in-vivo randomized controlled trial
      was conducted among refugees with uncomplicated falciparum malaria to determine
      whether five-day treatment (CQ40) was more effective than standard treatment
      (CQ25). METHODS: 142 falciparum patients were recruited into CQ25 or CQ40
      treatment arms and followed up to 60 days with regular blood smears. The primary 
      outcome was parasitological cure without recrudescence. Treatment failures were
      retreated with CQ40. PCR genotyping of 270 samples, from the same and nearby
      sites, was used to support interpretation of outcomes. RESULTS: 84% of CQ25
      versus 51% of CQ40 patients experienced parasite recrudescence during follow-up
      (adjusted odds ratio 0.17, 95%CI 0.08-0.38). Cure rates were significantly
      improved with CQ40, particularly among adults. Fever clearance time, parasite
      clearance time, and proportions gametocytaemic post-treatment were similar
      between treatment groups. Second-line CQ40 treatment resulted in higher failure
      rates than first-line CQ40 treatment. CQ-resistance marker pfcrt 76T was found in
      all isolates analysed, while pfmdr1 86Y and 184Y were found in 18% and 37% of
      isolates respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CQ is not suitable for first-line falciparum 
      treatment in Afghan refugee communities. The extended-dose CQ regimen can
      overcome 39% of resistant infections that would recrudesce under the standard
      regimen, but the high failure rate after directly observed treatment demonstrates
      its use is inappropriate.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum soluble extracts potentiate the suppressive function of
      polyclonal T regulatory cells through activation of TGFbeta-mediated signals.
PG  - 1328-38
LID - 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01622.x [doi]
AB  - Increased numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs), key mediators of immune
      homeostasis, were reported in human and murine malaria and it is current opinion 
      that these cells play a role in balancing protective immunity and pathogenesis
      during infection. However, the mechanisms governing their expansion during
      malaria infection are not completely defined. In this article we show that
      soluble extracts of Plasmodium falciparum (PfSEs), but not equivalent preparation
      of uninfected erythrocytes, induce the differentiation of polyclonally activated 
      CD4(+) cells in Tregs endowed with strong suppressive activity. PfSEs activate
      latent TGFbeta bound on the membrane of Treg cells, thus allowing the cytokine
      interaction with TGFbeta receptor, and inducing Foxp3 gene expression and TGFbeta
      production. The activation of membrane-bound latent TGFbeta by PfSEs is
      significantly reduced by a broad-spectrum metalloproteinases inhibitor with
      Zn(++) -chelating activity, and completely inhibited by the combined action of
      such inhibitor and antibodies to a P. falciparum thrombospondin-related adhesive 
      protein (PfTRAP). We conclude that Pf-Zn(++) -dependent proteinases and, to a
      lesser extent, PfTRAP molecules are involved in the activation of latent TGFbeta 
      bound on the membrane of activated Treg cells and suggest that, in malaria
      infection, this mechanism could contribute to the expansion of Tregs with
      different antigen specificity.

TI  - Field trial of three different Plasmodium vivax-detecting rapid diagnostic tests 
      with and without evaporative cool box storage in Afghanistan.
PG  - 169
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate parasitological diagnosis of malaria is essential for
      targeting treatment where more than one species coexist. In this study, three
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) (AccessBio CareStart (CSPfPan), CareStart PfPv
      (CSPfPv) and Standard Diagnostics Bioline (SDBPfPv)) were evaluated for their
      ability to detect natural Plasmodium vivax infections in a basic clinic setting. 
      The potential for locally made evaporative cooling boxes (ECB) to protect the
      tests from heat damage in high summer temperatures was also investigated.
      METHODS: Venous blood was drawn from P. vivax positive patients in Jalalabad,
      Afghanistan and tested against a panel of six RDTs. The panel comprised two of
      each test type; one group was stored at room temperature and the other in an ECB.
      RDT results were evaluated against a consensus gold standard based on two
      double-read reference slides and PCR. The sensitivity, specificity and a measure 
      of global performance for each test were determined and stratified by
      parasitaemia level and storage condition. RESULTS: In total, 306 patients were
      recruited, of which 284 were positive for P. vivax, one for Plasmodium malariae
      and none for Plasmodium falciparum; 21 were negative. All three RDTs were
      specific for malaria. The sensitivity and global performance index for each test 
      were as follows: CSPfPan [98.6%, 95.1%], CSPfPv [91.9%, 90.5%] and SDBPfPv
      [96.5%, 82.9%], respectively. CSPfPv was 16% less sensitive to a parasitaemia
      below 5,000/muL. Room temperature storage of SDBPfPv led to a high proportion of 
      invalid results (17%), which reduced to 10% in the ECB. Throughout the testing
      period, the ECB maintained ~8 degrees C reduction over ambient temperatures and
      never exceeded 30 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Of the three RDTs, the CSPfPan test was
      the most consistent and reliable, rendering it appropriate for this P. vivax
      predominant region. The CSPfPv test proved unsuitable owing to its reduced
      sensitivity at a parasitaemia below 5,000/muL (affecting 43% of study samples).
      Although the SDBPfPv device was more sensitive than the CSPfPv test, its invalid 
      rate was unacceptably high. ECB storage reduced the proportion of invalid results
      for the SDBPfPv test, but surprisingly had no impact on RDT sensitivity at low
      parasitaemia.

PG  - e20805
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0020805 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel diagnostic tools, including PCR and high field gradient
      magnetic fractionation (HFGMF), have improved detection of asexual Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites and especially infectious gametocytes in human blood. These 
      techniques indicate a significant number of people carry gametocyte densities
      that fall below the conventional threshold of detection achieved by standard
      light microscopy (LM). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine how low-level
      gametocytemia may affect transmission in present large-scale efforts for P.
      falciparum control in endemic areas, we developed a refinement of the classical
      Ross-Macdonald model of malaria transmission by introducing multiple infective
      compartments to model the potential impact of highly prevalent, low
      gametocytaemic reservoirs in the population. Models were calibrated using
      field-based data and several numerical experiments were conducted to assess the
      effect of high and low gametocytemia on P. falciparum transmission and control.
      Special consideration was given to the impact of long-lasting insecticide-treated
      bed nets (LLIN), presently considered the most efficient way to prevent
      transmission, and particularly LLIN coverage similar to goals targeted by the
      Roll Back Malaria and Global Fund malaria control campaigns. Our analyses
      indicate that models which include only moderate-to-high gametocytemia
      (detectable by LM) predict finite eradication times after LLIN introduction.
      Models that include a low gametocytemia reservoir (requiring PCR or HFGMF
      detection) predict much more stable, persistent transmission. Our modeled
      outcomes result in significantly different estimates for the level and duration
      of control needed to achieve malaria elimination if submicroscopic gametocytes
      are included. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It will be very important to complement
      current methods of surveillance with enhanced diagnostic techniques to detect
      asexual parasites and gametocytes to more accurately plan, monitor and guide
      malaria control programs aimed at eliminating malaria.

TI  - Pattern of malaria transmission along the Rahad River basin, Eastern Sudan.
PG  - 109

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding malaria vector mosquitoes and their infectivity
      dynamics is of importance in setting up intervention and control programmes.
      Patterns of malaria transmission have been shown to differ between non-irrigated 
      and irrigated semi-arid areas of eastern Sudan. However, very little information 
      is available regarding malaria transmission dynamics along the seasonal river's
      basin. Such information is required for the design of effective vector control
      strategies. METHODS: A longitudinal study for mosquito sampling using pyrethrum
      spray catch (PSC) was conducted in two villages (Koka & Um Salala) along the
      Rahad River basin from December 2005 to October 2006. The Plasmodium falciparum
      circumsporozoite (CSP) and human blood index (HBI) were detected by ELISA. Three 
      seasons were considered and the surveys represented cool dry, hot dry and rainy
      seasons were November - February, March - June, July - October, respectively. The
      CSP was compared between the seasons and populations using Chi-square test. The
      differences between the seasons and the populations in the other entomological
      indices, including Entomological Inoculation Rates (EIR), were measured using
      Tukey-Kramer HSD and Student T-test, respectively. The association between An.
      arabiensis density and monthly total rainfall was examined using regression
      analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,402 adult female anopheline mosquitoes were
      sampled, of which 98% were An. gambiae complex; the rest were An. rufipes. All
      specimens of An. gambiae complex identified by the PCR were An. arabiensis.
      Bimodal annual peaks of An. arabiensis densities were observed following the peak
      of rainfall and recess of the Rahad River after a time- lag of two months (Koka r
      = 0.79, d.f. = 1, P = 0.05; Um Salala, r = 0.88, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02). The CSP
      differed significantly among the seasons only in Koka (P = 0.0009) where the mean
      was nine times higher than in Um Salala (P = 0.0014). Active transmission was
      observed in Koka during the hot, dry season (CSP = 6.25%) and the EIR was
      observed to be 0.01 ib/p/n during this time. The EIR peaked to 0.71 ib/p/n during
      the rainy season and decreased to 0.18 ib/p/n during the minor peak of the cool
      dry season (P = 0.54). The combined annual average of the EIR for both
      populations was 55.48 ib/p/y and, typically, it would take approximately 192.7
      days for an individual to receive an infective bite from An. arabiensis.
      CONCLUSION: The bimodal annual peaks and the active transmission observed during 
      the hot dry season suggested low to moderate perennial malaria transmission
      pattern. Infectivity and transmission rates increased with proximity to the river
      following the peak of rainfall and the subsequent recession in the flow of the
      Rahad River. Current vector interventions can be integrated with larval control
      and should be formatted in accordance with targeted according to the time and
      space.

TI  - From in vivo to in vitro: dynamic analysis of Plasmodium falciparum var gene
      expression patterns of patient isolates during adaptation to culture.
PG  - e20591
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0020591 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), encoded by the var
      gene family, plays a crucial role in disease virulence through its involvement in
      binding to various host cellular receptors during infection. Growing evidence
      suggests that differential expression of the various var subgroups may be
      involved in parasite virulence. To further explore this issue, we have collected 
      isolates from symptomatic patients in south China-Myanmar border, and
      characterized their sequence diversity and transcription profiles over time of
      var gene family, and cytoadherence properties from the time of their initial
      collection and extending through a two month period of adaptation to culture.
      Initially, we established a highly diverse, DBLalpha (4 cysteines)
      subtype-enriched, but unique local repertoire of var-DBL1alpha sequences by cDNA 
      cloning and sequencing. Next we observed a rapid transcriptional decline of upsA-
      and upsB-subtype var genes at ring stage through qRT-PCR assays, and a switching 
      event from initial ICAM-I binding to the CD36-binding activity during the first
      week of adaptive cultivation in vitro. Moreover, predominant transcription of
      upsA var genes was observed to be correlated with those isolates that showed a
      higher parasitemia at the time of collection and the ICAM-1-binding phenotype in 
      culture. Taken together, these data indicate that the initial stage of adaptive
      process in vitro significantly influences the transcription of virulence-related 
      var subtypes and expression of PfEMP1 variants. Further, the specific
      upregulation of the upsA var genes is likely linked to the rapid propagation of
      the parasite during natural infection due to the A-type PfEMP1 variant-mediated
      growth advantages.

TI  - Chemical genetic screen identifies Toxoplasma DJ-1 as a regulator of parasite
      secretion, attachment, and invasion.
PG  - 10568-73
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1105622108 [doi]
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa that includes several
      important human pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium falciparum, the
      causative agent of human malaria. It is an obligate intracellular parasite that
      can cause severe disease in congenitally infected neonates and immunocompromised 
      individuals. Despite the importance of attachment and invasion to the success of 
      the parasite, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that drive these
      processes. Here we describe a screen to identify small molecules that block the
      process of host cell invasion by the T. gondii parasite. We identified a small
      molecule that specifically and irreversibly blocks parasite attachment and
      subsequent invasion of host cells. Using tandem orthogonal
      proteolysis-activity-based protein profiling, we determined that this compound
      covalently modifies a single cysteine residue in a poorly characterized protein
      homologous to the human protein DJ-1. Mutation of this key cysteine residue in
      the native gene sequence resulted in parasites that were resistant to inhibition 
      of host cell attachment and invasion by the compound. Further analysis of the
      invasion phenotype confirmed that modification of Cys127 on TgDJ-1 resulted in a 
      block of microneme secretion and motility, even in the presence of direct
      stimulators of calcium release. Together, our results suggest that TgDJ-1 plays
      an important role that is likely downstream of the calcium flux required for
      microneme secretion, parasite motility, and subsequent invasion of host cells.

TI  - Coma associated with microscopy-diagnosed Plasmodium vivax: a prospective study
      in Papua, Indonesia.
PG  - e1032
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coma complicates Plasmodium falciparum infection but is uncommonly
      associated with P. vivax. Most series of vivax coma have been retrospective and
      have not utilized molecular methods to exclude mixed infections with P.
      falciparum. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients hospitalized in Timika,
      Indonesia, with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) </=10 and P. vivax monoinfection on
      initial microscopy over a four year period. Hematological, biochemical,
      serological, radiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations were
      performed to identify other causes of coma. Repeat microscopy, antigen detection 
      and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to exclude infections with
      other Plasmodium species. RESULTS: Of 24 patients fulfilling enrolment criteria, 
      5 had clear evidence for other non-malarial etiologies. PCR demonstrated 10 mixed
      infections and 3 P. falciparum monoinfections. 6 (25%) patients had vivax
      monoinfection and no apparent alternative cause, with a median GCS of 9 (range
      8-10) and a median coma duration of 42 (range 36-48) hours. CSF leukocyte counts 
      were <10/ul (n=3); 2 of the 3 patients without CSF examination recovered with
      antimalarial therapy alone. One patient had a tremor on discharge consistent with
      a post-malarial neurological syndrome. No patient had other organ dysfunction.
      The only death was associated with pure P. falciparum infection by PCR. Vivax
      monoinfection-associated risk of coma was estimated at 1 in 29,486 clinical vivax
      infections with no deaths. In comparison, the risk of falciparum-associated coma 
      was estimated at 1 in 1,276 clinical infections with an 18.5% mortality rate.
      CONCLUSIONS: P. vivax-associated coma is rare, occurring 23 times less frequently
      than that seen with falciparum malaria, and is associated with a high proportion 
      of non-malarial causes and mixed infections using PCR. The pathogenesis of coma
      associated with vivax malaria, particularly the role of comorbidities, is
      uncertain and requires further investigation.

AB  - The rapid, accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium spp. is essential for the effective
      control of malaria, especially in asymptomatic infections. In this study, we
      developed a sensitive, genus-specific, real-time quantitative PCR assay. It was
      compared with the microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears and two 
      different molecular diagnostic techniques: nested PCR and multiplex PCR. For the 
      effective quantitative detection of malaria parasites, all reagents were designed
      with a lyophilized format in one tube. Plasmodium was detected successfully in
      all 112 clinically suspected malaria patients, including 32 individuals with low 
      parasitemia (1-100 parasites/mul). The sensitivity threshold was 0.2
      parasites/mul and no PCR-positive reaction occurred when malaria parasites were
      not present. This may be a useful method for detecting malaria parasites in
      endemic areas.

      Artemisia annua L. and its influence on artemisinin content.
PG  - 1919-28
LID - 10.1007/s00299-011-1099-6 [doi]
AB  - Artemisinin, an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone, is a novel antimalarial
      natural product isolated from Artemisia annua L. plants. The low concentrations
      (0.01-1.1%) of this compound in A. annua L. plants is, however, a major
      constraint for commercialization of artemisinin-based combination therapies
      (ACTs) recommended by WHO for treating malaria caused by multidrug-resistant P.
      falciparum sp. In this context, in vivo yield improvement programs were
      undertaken by us. In the present study, HMG-Co A reductase gene (hmgr) from
      Catharanthus roseus (L) G. Don and amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ads) gene from A.
      annua L. were over-expressed in A. annua L. plants to study their effects on
      artemisinin yields. The transgenic lines developed from putative transgenic
      regenerants were evaluated for integration and copy number of the transgenes
      using hptII gene probe, as it was a part of the expression cassette. The
      transgenic lines showed positive bands of hptII gene on Southern blots confirming
      the integration of transgenes. Some of the transgenic lines had single copy of
      the transgenes, while others had multiple copies. The expressions of hmgr and ads
      at the transcriptional level were also confirmed in each transgenic line
      employing RT-PCR assays. The HPLC analyses showed that the artemisinin contents
      were significantly increased in these transgenics. One of the transgenic lines,
      TR4, was found to contain 7.65-fold higher (1.73 mg/gDW) artemisinin than the
      non-transgenic plant (W). The increased artemisinin levels were found to be
      correlated with HMG-Co A reductase and amorpha-4,11-diene synthase enzymatic
      activities in the biochemical analyses.

AB  - Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is a major regulator of
      calcium-dependent signal transduction, which has been shown to be important in
      various processes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium. PI-PLC is generally
      implicated in calcium liberation from intracellular stores through the action of 
      its product, inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate, and is itself dependent on calcium
      for its activation. Here we describe the plc genes from Plasmodium species. The
      encoded proteins contain all domains typically found in PI-PLCs of the delta
      class but are almost twice as long as their orthologues in mammals.
      Transcriptional analysis by qRT-PCR of plc during the erythrocytic cycle of P.
      falciparum revealed steady expression levels that increased at the late schizont 
      stages. Genetic analysis in the P. berghei model revealed that the plc locus was 
      targetable but that plc gene knock-outs could not be obtained, thereby strongly
      indicating that the gene is essential during blood stage development.
      Alternatively, we attempted to modify plc expression through a promoter exchange 
      approach but found the gene to be refractory to over-expression indicating that
      plc expression levels might additionally be tightly controlled.

TI  - Efficacy of chloroquine plus primaquine treatment and pfcrt mutation in
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients in Rangamati, Bangladesh.
PG  - 341-6
LID - 10.1016/j.parint.2011.05.007 [doi]
AB  - A combination of chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) had been used as the
      first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Rangamati,
      Bangladesh until the end of 2004. Doctors or medical staffs had felt that CQ plus
      PQ had become less effective against uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients,
      but that it was more effective against the minority-indigenous patients than the 
      Bengali patients. The efficacy of CQ plus PQ and the mutation status of the CQ
      resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene of infecting P. falciparum were, thus,
      investigated for 45 uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients in Rangamati in
      2004. The total failure rate was 57.8%. One or two pfcrt sequences (CIETH and
      SMNTH at positions 72, 74-76, and 97, mutation underlined) with K76T mutation
      known to be related to CQ-resistant phenotype were detected in 38 patients' blood
      samples. Of the 38 patients, in total 15 patients (14/25 minority-indigenous and 
      1/13 Bengali patients) resulted in adequate clinical and parasitological response
      (ACPR). There was a statistically significant difference in ACPR rate between the
      minority-indigenous patients and the Bengali patients. P. falciparum with mutant 
      or resistant pfcrt (pfcrt-resistant) was detected by PCR in blood samples on day 
      28 for 10 ACPR minority-indigenous patients but not for the only one Bengali ACPR
      patient, who all were infected with pfcrt-resistant P. falciparum on day 0. The
      minority-indigenous patients, but not Bengalis, are suggested to be often cured
      by CQ plus PQ, leaving a very few parasites detectable only by PCR, even when
      they are infected with pfcrt-resistant P. falciparum.

AB  - The anti-malarial IgG immune response during the lengthy and dry season in areas 
      of low malaria transmission as in Eastern Sudan is largely unknown. In this
      study, ELISA was used for the measurement of pre-existing total IgG and IgG
      subclasses to a panel of malaria antigens, MSP2-3D7, MSP2-FC27, AMA-1 and
      Pf332-C231. The results showed that the antibody responses were predominantly age
      dependent, antigen specific, and their lifespan was at least 5-6 month long.
      Generally, the IgG3 was most abundant IgG subclass, and the most recognized
      antigen was Pf332-C231. Furthermore, the correlation between the levels of IgG
      subclasses was strongest between IgG1 and IgG3, which were more predictive to the
      total IgG levels. Finally, the response pattern of each of the IgG subclasses to 
      the different test antigens that were spanning the dry season and the correlation
      between these responses were described in details for the first time.

AB  - The technical capability of different methods to diagnose Plasmodium in maternal 
      peripheral blood, placenta, and umbilical cord blood has not been assessed in
      Colombia and seldom explored in other malaria-endemic regions. We designed a
      study to compare the technical and the operational-economical performances of
      light microscopy (LM), nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), and
      histopathology (HP). In maternal blood, LM had 41% sensitivity and 100%
      specificity and in placental blood, 35% and 100%, respectively, compared with
      nPCR. In placental tissue, LM had 33% sensitivity and 95% specificity; and nPCR
      47% and 77%, respectively; compared with HP. Light microscopy had the best
      operational-economical qualification. We concluded that nPCR and HP performed
      better compared with LM, but field implementation of these two techniques remains
      a problem. Therefore, LM is recommended as the gold standard for diagnosis of
      gestational malaria and placental blood infection in the field.

TI  - Transcription of var genes other than var2csa in Plasmodium falciparum parasites 
      infecting Mozambican pregnant women.
PG  - 27-35
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum infection during
      pregnancy has been attributed to the accumulation of infected erythrocytes in the
      placenta. This phenomenon is mediated by a var gene coding for VAR2CSA, which
      adheres to chondroitin sulphate A. However, the contribution of parasites
      transcribing other var genes to maternal infections has not been well
      characterized. METHODS: Transcription of var2csa and var groups A, B, and C was
      measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 30 placental and 21 peripheral
      P. falciparum isolates from pregnant women and in 42 isolates from nonpregnant
      adults and children. Associations of infections with non-var2csa isolates with
      maternal parasitemia and immune responses were assessed. RESULTS: Placental
      parasites showed the highest levels of var2csa. ABC var genes were transcribed by
      20 (67%) of 30 placental isolates and were associated with higher parasitemia
      compared with infections by parasites only transcribing var2csa (P = .004).
      Peripheral isolates from pregnant women transcribed ABC var genes at levels
      similar to those of parasites infecting nonpregnant adults with clinical malaria 
      (P[varA] = .420, P[varB] = .808, and P[varC] = .619). CONCLUSIONS: Transcripts of
      var2csa are abundant in pregnancy-associated P. falciparum infections; however,
      ABC var types are also common, especially in peripheral blood, with transcription
      levels similar to those of infections out of pregnancy. These findings are of
      interest for the design of malaria vaccines for pregnant women.

TI  - Hepatitis B infection is associated with asymptomatic malaria in the Brazilian
      Amazon.
PG  - e19841
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0019841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Areas that are endemic for malaria are also highly endemic for
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether HBV
      infection modifies the clinical presentation of malaria. This study aimed to
      address this question. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: An observational study of 636
      individuals was performed in Rondonia, western Amazon, Brazil between 2006 and
      2007. Active and passive case detections identified Plasmodium infection by field
      microscopy and nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). HBV infections were
      identified by serology and confirmed by real-time PCR. Epidemiological
      information and plasma cytokine profiles were studied. The data were analyzed
      using adjusted multinomial logistic regression. Plasmodium-infected individuals
      with active HBV infection were more likely to be asymptomatic (OR: 120.13,
      P<0.0001), present with lower levels of parasitemia and demonstrate a decreased
      inflammatory cytokine profile. Nevertheless, co-infected individuals presented
      higher HBV viremia. Plasmodium parasitemia inversely correlated with plasma HBV
      DNA levels (r = -0.6; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: HBV infection diminishes the
      intensity of malaria infection in individuals from this endemic area. This effect
      seems related to cytokine balance and control of inflammatory responses. These
      findings add important insights to the understanding of the factors affecting the
      clinical outcomes of malaria in endemic regions.

TI  - Wolbachia infections are virulent and inhibit the human malaria parasite
      Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles gambiae.
PG  - e1002043
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002043 [doi]
AB  - Endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria are potent modulators of pathogen infection and 
      transmission in multiple naturally and artificially infected insect species,
      including important vectors of human pathogens. Anopheles mosquitoes are
      naturally uninfected with Wolbachia, and stable artificial infections have not
      yet succeeded in this genus. Recent techniques have enabled establishment of
      somatic Wolbachia infections in Anopheles. Here, we characterize somatic
      infections of two diverse Wolbachia strains (wMelPop and wAlbB) in Anopheles
      gambiae, the major vector of human malaria. After infection, wMelPop disseminates
      widely in the mosquito, infecting the fat body, head, sensory organs and other
      tissues but is notably absent from the midgut and ovaries. Wolbachia initially
      induces the mosquito immune system, coincident with initial clearing of the
      infection, but then suppresses expression of immune genes, coincident with
      Wolbachia replication in the mosquito. Both wMelPop and wAlbB significantly
      inhibit Plasmodium falciparum oocyst levels in the mosquito midgut. Although not 
      virulent in non-bloodfed mosquitoes, wMelPop exhibits a novel phenotype and is
      extremely virulent for approximately 12-24 hours post-bloodmeal, after which
      surviving mosquitoes exhibit similar mortality trajectories to control
      mosquitoes. The data suggest that if stable transinfections act in a similar
      manner to somatic infections, Wolbachia could potentially be used as part of a
      strategy to control the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria.

TI  - Var2CSA minimal CSA binding region is located within the N-terminal region.
PG  - e20270
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0020270 [doi]
AB  - Var2CSA, a key molecule linked with pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), causes
      sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (PEs) in the
      placenta by adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Var2CSA possesses a 300 kDa 
      extracellular region composed of six Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains and a
      cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRpam) module. Although initial studies
      implicated several individual var2CSA DBL domains as important for adhesion of
      PEs to CSA, new studies revealed that these individual domains lack both the
      affinity and specificity displayed by the full-length extracellular region.
      Indeed, recent evidence suggests the presence of a single CSA-binding site formed
      by a higher-order domain organization rather than several independent binding
      sites located on the different domains. Here, we search for the minimal binding
      region within var2CSA that maintains high affinity and specificity for CSA
      binding, a characteristic feature of the full-length extracellular region.
      Accordingly, truncated recombinant var2CSA proteins comprising different domain
      combinations were expressed and their binding characteristics assessed against
      different sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Our results indicate that the
      smallest region within var2CSA with similar binding properties to those of the
      full-length var2CSA is DBL1X-3X. We also demonstrate that inhibitory antibodies
      raised in rabbit against the full-length DBL1X-6epsilon target principally DBL3X 
      and, to a lesser extent, DBL5epsilon. Taken together, our results indicate that
      efforts should focus on the DBL1X-3X region for developing vaccine and
      therapeutic strategies aimed at combating PAM.

TI  - The distribution of Plasmodium falciparum infection durations.
PG  - 109-18
LID - 10.1016/j.epidem.2011.03.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The duration of untreated Plasmodium falciparum infections in
      naturally exposed human populations is of interest for rational planning of
      malaria control interventions as it is related to the duration of infectivity.
      The extent of variability in duration is relevant where transmission is seasonal,
      and for the planning of elimination efforts. Methods for measuring these
      quantities from genotyping data have been restricted to exponential models of
      infection survival, as implied by constant clearance rates. Such models have
      greatly improved the understanding of infection dynamics on a population level
      but likely misrepresent the within-host dynamics of many pathogens. Conversely,
      the statistical properties of the distribution of infection durations, and how
      these are affected by exposure, should contain information on within-host
      dynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We extended existing methods for the analysis of
      longitudinal genotyping data on P. falciparum infections. Our method
      simultaneously estimates force of infection, detectability, and the distribution 
      of infection durations. Infection durations are modeled using parametric survival
      distributions. The method is validated using simulated data, and applied to data 
      from a cohort study in Navrongo, Northern Ghana. Distribution estimates from
      exponential, Weibull, lognormal, and gamma models are compared with the
      distribution of durations in malariatherapy data. CONCLUSIONS: The Weibull model 
      fitted the data best. It estimated a shorter mean duration than the exponential
      model, which gave the worst fit. The distribution estimates appeared positively
      skewed when compared with the distribution of durations in malariatherapy data,
      suggesting that a significant proportion of infections is cleared shortly after
      inoculation. We conclude that malariatherapy data, the most important source of
      information on P. falciparum within-host dynamics, may not be representative of
      the actual processes in natural populations, and should be used with care.
      Further, conclusions from transmission models assuming exponential infection
      survival may be biased.

TI  - High frequency of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance marker (pfcrt T76 
      mutation) in Yemen: an urgent need to re-examine malaria drug policy.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-4-94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a significant health problem in Yemen with Plasmodium
      falciparum being the predominant species which is responsible for 90% of the
      malaria cases. Despite serious concerns regarding increasing drug resistance,
      chloroquine is still used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in Yemen.
      This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of choloroquine resistance
      (CQR) of P. falciparum isolated from Yemen based on the pfcrt T76 mutation.
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 511 participants from four
      governorates in Yemen. Blood samples were screened using microscopic and
      species-specific nested PCR based on the 18S rRNA gene to detect and identify
      Plasmodium species. Blood samples positive for P. falciparum were used for
      detecting the pfcrt T76 mutation using nested-PCR. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      pfcrt T76 mutation was 81.5% (66 of 81 isolates). Coastal areas/foothills had
      higher prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation compared to highland areas (90.5% vs
      71.8%) (p = 0.031). The pfcrt T76 mutation had a significant association with
      parasitaemia (p = 0.045). Univariate analysis shows a significant association of 
      pfcrt T76 mutation with people aged > 10 years (OR = 9, 95% CI = 2.3 - 36.2, p = 
      0.001), low household income (OR = 5, 95% CI = 1.3 - 19.5, p = 0.027), no
      insecticide spray (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.16 - 11.86, p = 0.025) and not sleeping
      under insecticide treated nets (ITNs) (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.38 - 16.78, p =
      0.01). Logistic regression model confirmed age > 10 years and low household
      income as predictors of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen P. falciparum isolates.
      CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen could be a
      predictive marker for the prevalence of P. falciparum CQR. This finding shows the
      necessity for an in-vivo therapeutic efficacy test for CQ. P. falciparum CQR
      should be addressed in the national strategy to control malaria.

      Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Brazilian endemic area.
PG  - 146
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Binding Antigen-175 (EBA-175)
      is an antigen considered to be one of the leading malaria vaccine candidates.
      EBA-175 mediates sialic acid-dependent binding to glycophorin A on the
      erythrocytes playing a crucial role during invasion of the P. falciparum in the
      host cell. Dimorphic allele segments, termed C-fragment and F-fragment, have been
      found in high endemicity malaria areas and associations between the dimorphism
      and severe malaria have been described. In this study, the genetic dimorphism of 
      EBA-175 was evaluated in P. falciparum field isolates from Brazilian malaria
      endemic area. METHODS: The study was carried out in rural villages situated near 
      Porto Velho, Rondonia State in the Brazilian Amazon in three time points between 
      1993 and 2008. The allelic dimorphism of the EBA-175 was analysed by Nested PCR. 
      RESULTS: The classical allelic dimorphism of the EBA-175 was identified in the
      studied area. Overall, C-fragment was amplified in a higher frequency than
      F-fragment. The same was observed in the three time points where C-fragment was
      observed in a higher frequency than F-fragment. Single infections (one fragment
      amplified) were more frequent than mixed infection (two fragments amplified).
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the dimorphism of EBA175, since only the two 
      types of fragments were amplified, C-fragment and F-fragment. Also, the results
      show the remarkable predominance of CAMP allele in the studied area. The
      comparative analysis in three time points indicates that the allelic dimorphism
      of the EBA-175 is stable over time.

TI  - Is screening for malaria necessary among asymptomatic refugees and immigrants
      coming from endemic countries?
PG  - 521-4

AB  - Malaria is endemic throughout most of the tropics mainly due to Plasmodium
      falciparum. Outside the tropics, cases have been described among mobile
      population groups, such as travellers, immigrants and refugees. Malaria
      prevalence among refugees ranges from 3% to more than 60%, many of them being
      asymptomatic. This article assesses the findings of a recent study performed in
      Canada where malaria prevalence among recently arrived asymptomatic refugees was 
      measured. A total of 324 refugees were screened for malaria, obtaining a global
      prevalence of 3.1% by PCR. Identifying imported, asymptomatic cases of malaria
      may have an important impact both for the individual concerned and for public
      health.

TI  - Review of cases with the emerging fifth human malaria parasite, Plasmodium
      knowlesi.
PG  - 1356-62
LID - 10.1093/cid/cir180 [doi]
AB  - Human malaria has been known to be caused by 4 Plasmodium species, with
      Plasmodium falciparum causing the most-severe disease. Recently, numerous reports
      have described human malaria caused by a fifth Plasmodium species, Plasmodium
      knowlesi, which usually infects macaque monkeys. Hundreds of human cases have
      been reported from Malaysia, several cases have been reported in other Southeast 
      Asian countries, and a few cases have been reported in travelers visiting these
      areas. Similarly to P. falciparum, P. knowlesi can cause severe and even fatal
      cases of disease that are more severe than those caused by the other Plasmodium
      species. Polymerase chain reaction is of value for diagnosis because P. knowlesi 
      infection is easily misdiagnosed as less dangerous Plasmodium malariae infection 
      with conventional microscopy. P. knowlesi infection should be suspected in
      patients who are infected with malaria in Southeast Asia. If human-mosquito-human
      transmission were to occur, the disease could spread to new areas where the
      mosquito vectors live, such as the popular tourist areas in western India.
