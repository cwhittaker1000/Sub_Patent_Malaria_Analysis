TI  - Combining parasite lactate dehydrogenase-based and histidine-rich protein 2-based
      rapid tests to improve specificity for diagnosis of malaria Due to Plasmodium
      knowlesi and other Plasmodium species in Sabah, Malaysia.
PG  - 2053-60

AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi causes severe and fatal malaria in Malaysia. Microscopic
      misdiagnosis is common and may delay appropriate treatment. P. knowlesi can
      cross-react with "species-specific" parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)
      monoclonal antibodies used in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect P.
      falciparum and P. vivax. At one tertiary-care hospital and two district hospitals
      in Sabah, we prospectively evaluated two combination RDTs for malaria diagnosis
      by using both a pan-Plasmodium-pLDH (pan-pLDH)/P. falciparum-specific-pLDH
      (Pf-pLDH) RDT (OptiMAL-IT) and a non-P. falciparum VOM-pLDH/Pf-HRP2 RDT
      (CareStart). Differential cross-reactivity among these combinations was
      hypothesized to differentiate P. knowlesi from other Plasmodium monoinfections.
      Among 323 patients with PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi (n = 193), P. falciparum (n =
      93), and P. vivax (n = 37) monoinfections, the VOM-pLDH individual component had 
      the highest sensitivity for nonsevere (35%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to
      43%) and severe (92%; CI, 81 to 100%) P. knowlesi malaria. CareStart demonstrated
      a P. knowlesi sensitivity of 42% (CI, 34 to 49%) and specificity of 74% (CI, 65
      to 82%), a P. vivax sensitivity of 83% (CI, 66 to 93%) and specificity of 71%
      (CI, 65 to 76%), and a P. falciparum sensitivity of 97% (CI, 90 to 99%) and
      specificity of 99% (CI, 97 to 100%). OptiMAL-IT demonstrated a P. knowlesi
      sensitivity of 32% (CI, 25 to 39%) and specificity of 21% (CI, 15 to 29%), a P.
      vivax sensitivity of 60% (CI, 42 to 75%) and specificity of 97% (CI, 94 to 99%), 
      and a P. falciparum sensitivity of 82% (CI, 72 to 89%) and specificity of 39%
      (CI, 33 to 46%). The combination of CareStart plus OptiMAL-IT for P. knowlesi
      using predefined criteria gave a sensitivity of 25% (CI, 19 to 32%) and
      specificity of 97% (CI, 92 to 99%). Combining two RDT combinations was highly
      specific for P. knowlesi malaria diagnosis; however, sensitivity was poor. The
      specificity of pLDH RDTs was decreased for P. vivax and P. falciparum because of 
      P. knowlesi cross-reactivity and cautions against their use alone in areas where 
      P. knowlesi malaria is endemic. Sensitive P. knowlesi-specific RDTs and/or
      alternative molecular diagnostic tools are needed in areas where P. knowlesi
      malaria is endemic.

TI  - Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection is associated with anaemia in
      pregnancy and can be more cost-effectively detected by rapid diagnostic test than
      by microscopy in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
PG  - 132
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In areas of high malaria transmission, Plasmodium falciparum
      infection during pregnancy is characterized by malaria-related anaemia, placental
      malaria and does not always result in clinical symptoms. This situation is
      associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine
      the extent of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection, its relation with anaemia as 
      well as the most cost-effective technique for its diagnosis in healthy pregnant
      women living in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study design, information on socio-demographic characteristics
      and cost data were collected in healthy pregnant women attending antenatal care
      consultations. Plasmodium falciparum infection was diagnosed using rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Haemoglobin concentration was also determined. RESULTS: In total, 332 pregnant
      women were enrolled. RDT and microscopy data were available for all the blood
      samples and 166 samples were analysed by PCR. The prevalence of asymptomatic P.
      falciparum infection using microscopy, RDTs and PCR, were respectively 21.6%,
      27.4% and 29.5%. Taking PCR as a reference, RDTs had a sensitivity of 81.6% and a
      specificity of 94.9% to diagnose asymptomatic P. falciparum infection. The
      corresponding values for microscopy were 67.3% and 97.4%. The prevalence of
      anaemia was 61.1% and asymptomatic malaria increased five times the odds (p <
      0.001) of having anaemia. RDTs were more cost-effective compared to microscopy.
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 63.47 per microscopy adequately
      diagnosed case. CONCLUSION: These alarming results emphasize the need to actively
      diagnose and treat asymptomatic malaria infection during all antenatal care
      visits. Moreover, in DRC, malaria and anaemia control efforts should be
      strengthened by promoting the use of insecticide-treated nets, intermittent
      preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and iron and folic acid
      supplements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various factors determine the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum
      infection such as parasite load, sequestration, adhesion molecules, and immune
      mediators. P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) and msp-2 genotypes 
      were also found associated with severe disease. We investigated the association
      between msp-1 and msp-2 genotypes in patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM) and
      severe malaria (SM). METHODS: Twenty-two malaria patients with
      microscopy-confirmed P. falciparum infection and eight healthy endemic controls
      were selected for analysis. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
      identify P. falciparum genotypes. The plasma concentration of cytokines [tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma)] and chemokines [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10]
      were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS:
      TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in both UM (389 pg/mL, p = 0.020) and 
      SM (771 pg/mL, p = 0.004) compared with healthy controls, while they were greater
      in SM (p = 0.012) as compared to UM. CXCL9 levels were significantly raised in SM
      as compared to UM and negative controls (NCs). CXCL10 levels were raised in UM
      (550 pg/mL, p = 0.001) and SM (1480 pg/mL, p = 0.01) as compared with NCs.
      Increased levels of IL-6 were found in patients carrying the FC27 allelic type of
      msp-2. A higher prevalence of MAD 20 and K1 msp-1 alleles was observed in the SM 
      group compared to UM. CONCLUSION: Overall, a greater prevalence of MAD 20 alleles
      and increased serum TNF-alpha and CXCL9 levels were associated with severe
      outcome in malaria. Understanding the diversity of malaria genotypes is important
      for predicting disease-related outcomes of P. falciparum infection in endemic
      areas.

TI  - Biting by Anopheles funestus in broad daylight after use of long-lasting
      insecticidal nets: a new challenge to malaria elimination.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria control is mainly based on indoor residual spraying and
      insecticide-treated bed nets. The efficacy of these tools depends on the
      behaviour of mosquitoes, which varies by species. With resistance to
      insecticides, mosquitoes adapt their behaviour to ensure their survival and
      reproduction. The aim of this study was to assess the biting behaviour of
      Anopheles funestus after the implementation of long-lasting insecticidal nets
      (LLINs). METHODS: A study was conducted in Dielmo, a rural Senegalese village,
      after a second massive deployment of LLINs in July 2011. Adult mosquitoes were
      collected by human landing catch and by pyrethrum spray catch monthly between
      July 2011 and April 2013. Anophelines were identified by stereomicroscope and
      sub-species by PCR. The presence of circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium
      falciparum and the blood meal origin were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: Anopheles
      funestus showed a behavioural change in biting activity after introduction of
      LLINs, remaining anthropophilic and endophilic, while adopting diurnal feeding,
      essentially on humans. Six times more An. funestus were captured in broad
      daylight than at night. Only one infected mosquito was found during day capture. 
      The mean of day CSP rate was 1.28% while no positive An. funestus was found in
      night captures. CONCLUSION: Mosquito behaviour is an essential component for
      assessing vectorial capacity to transmit malaria. The emergence of new
      behavioural patterns of mosquitoes may significantly increase the risk for
      malaria transmission and represents a new challenge for malaria control.
      Additional vector control strategies are, therefore, necessary.

TI  - High prevalence of pfcrt-CVIET haplotype in isolates from asymptomatic and
      symptomatic patients in south-central Oromia, Ethiopia.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a result of extensive chloroquine resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium
      falciparum in late 1990s, Ethiopia replaced CQ with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP) as first-line drug, which in turn was replaced by artemisinin combination
      therapy in 2004. Plasmodium falciparum resistance to CQ is determined by the
      mutation at K76T of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) 
      gene. Understanding diversity in the P. falciparum genome is crucial since it has
      the potential to influence important phenotypes of the parasite such as drug
      resistance. Limited data is available regarding the type of pfcrt mutant allelic 
      type, the effect of CQ withdrawal and diversity of the parasite population in
      south-central Oromia, Ethiopia. METHODS: Finger-pricked blood spotted on Whatman 
      3MM filter papers were collected from falciparum malaria patients. Parasite DNA
      was extracted from individual blood spots on the filter papers. The presence of
      K76T mutations was determined using nested PCR for all isolates. Complete
      sequencing of mutations in pfcrt 72-76 was done for a set of randomly selected
      resistant isolates. Four microsatellite (MS) markers were analysed to determine
      the heterozygosity. RESULTS: Although CQ was withdrawn for more than a decade,
      100% of the parasites still carried the pfcrt K76T mutation. All isolates were
      mutant at the K76T polymorphism. Based on combinations of MS markers, seven
      different Ethiopian CQR variants (E1-E7) were identified. Heterozygosity (H(e))
      for MS flanking the pfcrt chloroquine resistance allele ranged from 0.00 (mscrt
      -29, -29.268 kb) to 0.21 (mscrt -2, -2.814 kb). H(e) ranged from 0.00 (msint 3, 0
      kb) to 0.19 (msint 2, 0 kb) for MS within the pfcrt gene. Both intronic and MS
      flanking the pfcrt gene showed low levels of diversity. CONCLUSION: pfcrt CQR
      allele seems to be fixed in the study area. Of the different haplotypes
      associated with CQR, only the CVIET genotype was identified. No reversal to the
      wild-type has occurred in Ethiopia unlike in many Africa countries where CQR
      parasites declined after cessation of CQ use. Decreased diversity in CQR isolates
      surrounding pfcrt suggests CQ selection and homogenization among CQR parasite
      population. While mutation in msint 3 and mscrt -29 of the mutant pfcrt allele is
      being fixed, it seems that mutations in msint 2 and mscrt -2 are still evolving
      and may indicate the start of re-diversification of the population from a fixed
      76 T population.

      imbalance, inflammation and hypoxia in women from north-west Colombia.
PG  - 122

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large-scale study was set up in order to study the epidemiology,
      clinical aspects, and immunopathology of gestational and placental malaria in
      north-west Colombia. In this region, recent reports using a qPCR technique,
      confirmed frequencies of infection, by Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax,
      up to 45%. Given the high rates of infection observed both in mother and
      placenta, a first exploratory study was proposed in order to characterize the
      effect on the inflammation status, tissue damage and hypoxia in Plasmodium spp.
      infected placentas. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, cross-sectional design
      was applied to pregnant women with (PM+) and without (PM-) placental malaria.
      Messenger RNA expression of Fas, FasL; COX-1, COX-2, HIF, VEGF, and the cytokines
      IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF, were measured in peripheral and placental
      blood using a quantitative PCR. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined 
      with a TUNEL assay. RESULTS: In total 50 placentas were studied: 25 were positive
      for submicroscopic infection and 25 were negative for Plasmodium infection.
      Expression of IL-4 and IL-10 was observed high in placental tissue of PM+, while 
      IL-2 was high in peripheral blood of the same group. Expression of TNF and
      IFNgamma in peripheral blood of the PM + group was high. Similarly, the apoptotic
      index and Fas expression were significantly high in PM+. However, FasL expression
      was observed low in PM + compared to PM-. Inflammation markers (HIF, VEGF) and
      hypoxia markers (COX-1, COX-2) were high in the PM + group. CONCLUSION: During
      placental malaria expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines is up-regulated
      and markers of hypoxia and tissue damage are increased in cases of submicroscopic
      infection.

      Southern Thailand.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is a major problem in
      malaria control especially along the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodia borders. To
      date, a few molecular markers have been identified for anti-malarial resistance
      in P. falciparum, including the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter 
      (pfcrt) and the P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1). However no
      information is available regarding the distribution pattern of these gene
      polymorphisms in the parasites from the Thai-Malaysia border. This study was
      conducted to compare the distribution pattern of the pfcrt and pfmdr1
      polymorphisms in the parasites from the lower southern provinces, Thai-Malaysia
      border and the upper southern provinces, Thai-Myanmar border. In addition, in
      vitro sensitivities of anti-malarial drugs including chloroquine, mefloquine,
      quinine, and artesunate were determined. METHODS: In all, 492 P.
      falciparum-positive blood samples were collected from the lower southern
      provinces: Songkhla, Yala and Narathiwas. From the upper southern part of
      Thailand, Ranong and Chumphon, 66 samples were also collected. Polymorphisms of
      the pfcrt and the pfmdr1 gene were determined using PCR techniques. In vitro
      sensitivities of anti-malarial drugs were determined using radioisotopic method. 
      RESULTS: All parasites from both areas contained the pfcrt 76 T allele. The
      pfmdr1 86Y allele was significantly more common in the parasites isolated from
      the lower southern areas. In contrast, the pfmdr1 184F allele was predominant
      among the parasites from the upper southern areas especially Ranong. In addition,
      the parasites from Ranong contained higher copy numbers than the parasites from
      other provinces. All adapted parasite isolates exhibited CQ-resistant phenotype. 
      Neither QN nor MQ resistance was detected in these isolates. CONCLUSION: The
      parasites from Thai-Malaysia border exhibited different resistant patterns
      compared to other areas along the international border of Thailand. This
      information will be useful for anti-malarial drug policy in Thailand.

TI  - Efficacy of two versus three-day regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for
      uncomplicated malaria in military personnel in northern Cambodia: an open-label
      randomized trial.
PG  - e93138
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0093138 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging antimalarial drug resistance in mobile populations remains
      a significant public health concern. We compared two regimens of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in military and civilians on the Thai-Cambodian
      border to evaluate national treatment policy. METHODS: Efficacy and safety of two
      and three-day regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were compared as a
      nested open-label evaluation within a malaria cohort study in 222 otherwise
      healthy volunteers (18% malaria-infected at baseline). The first 80 volunteers
      with slide-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum or vivax malaria were randomized 1:1
      to receive either regimen (total dose 360 mg dihydroartemisinin and 2880 mg
      piperaquine) and followed weekly for up to 6 months. The primary endpoint was
      malaria recurrence by day 42. Volunteers with vivax infection received primaquine
      at study discharge with six months follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty patients (60 vivax,
      15 falciparum, and 5 mixed) were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.
      Intention-to-treat all-species efficacy at Day 42 was 85% for the two-day regimen
      (95% CI 69-94) and 90% for the three-day regimen (95% CI 75-97). PCR-adjusted
      falciparum efficacy was 75% in both groups with nearly half (45%) still
      parasitemic at Day 3. Plasma piperaquine levels were comparable to prior
      published reports, but on the day of recrudescence were below measurable in vitro
      piperaquine IC50 levels in all falciparum treatment failures. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      brief period since introduction of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, there is early
      evidence suggesting declining efficacy relative to previous reports. Parasite
      IC50 levels in excess of plasma piperaquine levels seen only in treatment
      failures raises concern for clinically significant piperaquine resistance in
      Cambodia. These findings warrant improved monitoring of clinical outcomes and
      follow-up, given few available alternative drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01280162.

AB  - We evaluated the dynamics of parasite populations during in vitro culture
      adaptation in 15 mixed Plasmodium falciparum infections, which were collected
      from a hypoendemic area near the China-Myanmar border. Allele types at the msp1
      block 2 in the initial clinical samples and during subsequent culture were
      quantified weekly using a quantitative PCR method. All mixed infections carried
      two allele types based on the msp1 genotyping result. We also genotyped several
      polymorphic sites in the dhfr, dhps and mdr1 genes on day 0 and day 28, which
      showed that most of the common sites analyzed were monomorphic. Two of the three 
      clinical samples mixed at dhps 581 remained stable while one changed to wild-type
      during the culture. During in vitro culture, we observed a gradual loss of
      parasite populations with 10 of the 15 mixed infections becoming monoclonal by
      day 28 based on the msp1 allele type. In most cases, the more abundant msp1
      allele types in the clinical blood samples at the beginning of culture became the
      sole or predominant allele types on day 28. These results suggest that some
      parasites may have growth advantages and the loss of parasite populations during 
      culture adaptation of mixed infections may lead to biased results when comparing 
      the phenotypes such as drug sensitivity of the culture-adapted parasites.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been
      associated with pfcrt 76T (chloroquine resistance transporter gene) and pfmdr1
      86Y (multidrug resistance gene 1) alleles. Pfcrt 76T enables transport of
      protonated chloroquine out of the parasites digestive vacuole resulting in a loss
      of hydrogen ions (H(+)). V type H(+) pyrophosphatase (PfVP2) is thought to pump
      H(+) into the digestive vacuole. This study aimed to describe the geographic
      distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfvp2 and their possible
      associations with pfcrt and pfmdr1 polymorphisms. METHODS: Blood samples from 384
      patients collected (1981-2009) in Honduras (n=35), Colombia (n=50), Liberia
      (n=50), Guinea Bissau (n=50), Tanzania (n=50), Iran (n=50), Thailand (n=49) and
      Vanuatu (n=50) were analysed. The pfcrt 72-76 haplotype, pfmdr1 copy numbers,
      pfmdr1 N86Y and pfvp2 V405I, K582R and P711S alleles were identified using PCR
      based methods. RESULTS: Pfvp2 was amplified in 344 samples. The pfvp2 allele
      proportions were V405 (97%), 405I (3%), K582 (99%), 582R (1%), P711 (97%) and
      711S (3%). The number of patients with any of pfvp2 405I, 582R and/or 711S were
      as follows: Honduras (2/30), Colombia (0/46), Liberia (7/48), Guinea-Bissau
      (4/50), Tanzania (3/48), Iran (3/50), Thailand (1/49) and Vanuatu (0/31). The
      alleles were most common in Liberia (P=0.01) and Liberia+Guinea-Bissau (P=0.01). 
      The VKP haplotype was found in 189/194 (97%) and 131/145 (90%) samples harbouring
      pfcrt 76T and pfcrt K76 respectively (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The VKP haplotype
      was dominant. Most pfvp2 405I, 582R and 711S SNPs were seen where CQ resistance
      was not highly prevalent at the time of blood sampling possibly due to greater
      genetic variation prior to the bottle neck event of spreading CQ resistance. The 
      association between the pfvp2 VKP haplotype and pfcrt 76T, which may indicate
      that pfvp2 is involved in CQ resistance, should therefore be interpreted with
      caution.

AB  - Mechanisms regulating gene expression in malaria parasites are not well
      understood. Little is known about how the parasite regulates its gene expression 
      during transition from one developmental stage to another and in response to
      various environmental conditions. Parasites in a diseased host face environments 
      which differ from the static, well adapted in vitro conditions. Parasites thus
      need to adapt quickly and effectively to these conditions by establishing
      transcriptional states which are best suited for better survival. With the
      discovery of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in this parasite and
      considering the various proposed mechanisms by which NATs might regulate gene
      expression, it has been speculated that these might be playing a critical role in
      gene regulation. We report here the diversity of NATs in this parasite, using
      isolates taken directly from patients with differing clinical symptoms caused by 
      malaria infection. Using a custom designed strand specific whole genome
      microarray, a total of 797 NATs targeted against annotated loci have been
      detected. Out of these, 545 NATs are unique to this study. The majority of NATs
      were positively correlated with the expression pattern of the sense transcript.
      However, 96 genes showed a change in sense/antisense ratio on comparison between 
      uncomplicated and complicated disease conditions. The antisense transcripts map
      to a broad range of biochemical/metabolic pathways, especially pathways
      pertaining to the central carbon metabolism and stress related pathways. Our data
      strongly suggests that a large group of NATs detected here are unannotated
      transcription units antisense to annotated gene models. The results reveal a
      previously unknown set of NATs that prevails in this parasite, their differential
      regulation in disease conditions and mapping to functionally well annotated
      genes. The results detailed here call for studies to deduce the possible
      mechanism of action of NATs, which would further help in understanding the in
      vivo pathological adaptations of these parasites.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) have been postulated as a way to
      ensure access to malaria diagnosis in remote areas. Despite its widespread use,
      there are no field studies to evaluate the accuracy of the SD Bioline Malaria
      Antigen Pf/Pv in Colombia RDT. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 
      the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen Pf/Pv(R) RDT in two departments endemic for
      malaria, comparing diagnosis with thick film corrected with PCR. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
      concordance and sensitivity limits according to parasitemia ranges for the SD
      Bioline Malaria Antigen Pf/Pv (R) test in Cordoba and Choco. The results were
      compared with microscopy corrected by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 383 samples
      processed, 121 were positive (75 for P. vivax , 42 for P. falciparum and 4 for
      mixed infection) and 262 negative samples. P. vivax: sensitivity 92.0% (95% CI:
      83.6-96.3), specificity 98.7% ( 95% CI: 96.7-99.5), PPV 94.5% (95% CI:
      86.7-97.9), NPV 98.1% (95% CI: 95.8-99.1), Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.90
      (0.80-1.00). P. falciparum: sensitivity 88.1% (95% CI: 75.0-94.8), specificity
      97.9% (95% CI: 95.8-99.0), PPV 84.1% (95% CI: 70.6-92.1), NPV 98.5% (95% IC:
      96.6-99.4), Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      test performed well, being better for P. vivax as compared to P. falciparum.
      There are still difficulties of RDT to detect low parasitemias. The non
      amplification of Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in two samples diagnosed as mixed
      infection, suggest a possible deletion of these two genes together.

TI  - Rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum with isothermal recombinase polymerase
      amplification and lateral flow analysis.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-99 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification is the most sensitive and specific method 
      to detect Plasmodium falciparum. However the polymerase chain reaction remains
      laboratory-based and has to be conducted by trained personnel. Furthermore, the
      power dependency for the thermocycling process and the costly equipment necessary
      for the read-out are difficult to cover in resource-limited settings. This study 
      aims to develop and evaluate a combination of isothermal nucleic acid
      amplification and simple lateral flow dipstick detection of the malaria parasite 
      for point-of-care testing. METHODS: A specific fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of
      P. falciparum was amplified in 10 min at a constant 38 degrees C using the
      isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method. With a unique probe
      system added to the reaction solution, the amplification product can be
      visualized on a simple lateral flow strip without further labelling. The
      combination of these methods was tested for sensitivity and specificity with
      various Plasmodium and other protozoa/bacterial strains, as well as with human
      DNA. Additional investigations were conducted to analyse the temperature optimum,
      reaction speed and robustness of this assay. RESULTS: The lateral flow RPA
      (LF-RPA) assay exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity. Experiments
      confirmed a detection limit as low as 100 fg of genomic P. falciparum DNA,
      corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately four parasites per reaction. All 
      investigated P. falciparum strains (n=77) were positively tested while all of the
      total 11 non-Plasmodium samples, showed a negative test result. The enzymatic
      reaction can be conducted under a broad range of conditions from 30-45 degrees C 
      with high inhibitory concentration of known PCR inhibitors. A time to result of
      15 min from start of the reaction to read-out was determined. CONCLUSIONS:
      Combining the isothermal RPA and the lateral flow detection is an approach to
      improve molecular diagnostic for P. falciparum in resource-limited settings. The 
      system requires none or only little instrumentation for the nucleic acid
      amplification reaction and the read-out is possible with the naked eye. Showing
      the same sensitivity and specificity as comparable diagnostic methods but
      simultaneously increasing reaction speed and dramatically reducing assay
      requirements, the method has potential to become a true point-of-care test for
      the malaria parasite.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem, and its control has
      been hampered by drug resistance. For a number of drugs, Plasmodium falciparum
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with altered drug
      sensitivity and can be used as markers of drug resistance. Several techniques
      have been studied to assess resistance markers. The most widely used methodology 
      is restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The ligase detection
      reaction fluorescent microsphere (LDR-FM) assay was recently shown to provide
      high throughput assessment of P. falciparum SNPs associated with drug resistance.
      The aim of this study was to validate the reliability and accuracy of the LDR-FM 
      assay in a field setting. METHODS: For 223 samples from a clinical trial in
      Tororo, Uganda in which P. falciparum was identified by blood smear, DNA was
      extracted from dried blood spots, genes of interest were amplified by PCR,
      amplicons were analysed by both RFLP and LDR-FM assays, and results were
      compared. RESULTS: SNP prevalence (wild type/mixed/mutant) with RFLP analysis was
      8/5/87% for pfcrt K76T, 34/37/29% for pfmdr1 N86Y, 64/17/19% for pfmdr1 Y184F,
      and 42/21/37% for pfmdr1 D1246Y. These prevalences with the LDR-FM assay were
      7/5/88%, 31/24/45%, 62/20/18%, and 48/19/33% for the four SNPs, respectively.
      Combining mixed and mutant outcomes for analysis, agreement between the assays
      was 97% (K=0.77) for pfcrt K76T, 79% (K=0.55) for pfmdr1 N86Y, 83% (K=0.65) for
      pfmdr1 Y184F, and 91% (K=0.82) for pfmdr1 D1246Y, with most disagreements due to 
      discrepant readings of mixed genotypes. CONCLUSION: The LDR-FM assay provides a
      high throughput, relatively inexpensive and accurate assay for the surveillance
      of P. falciparum SNPs associated with drug resistance in resource-limited
      countries.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major public health problem in Thailand due to
      the emergence of multidrug resistance. The understanding of genetic diversity of 
      malaria parasites is essential for developing effective drugs and vaccines. The
      genetic diversity of the merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1) and merozoite
      surface protein-2 (PfMSP-2) genes was investigated in a total of 145 P.
      falciparum isolates collected from Mae Sot District, Tak Province, Thailand
      during 3 different periods (1997-1999, 2005-2007, and 2009-2010). Analysis of
      genetic polymorphisms was performed to track the evolution of genetic change of
      P. falciparum using PCR. Both individual genes and their combination patterns
      showed marked genetic diversity during the 3 study periods. The results strongly 
      support that P. falciparum isolates in Thailand are markedly diverse and patterns
      changed with time. These 2 polymorphic genes could be used as molecular markers
      to detect multiple clone infections and differentiate recrudescence from
      reinfection in P. falciparum isolates in Thailand.

TI  - Pre-amplification methods for tracking low-grade Plasmodium falciparum
      populations during scaled-up interventions in Southern Zambia.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-89 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is receding in many endemic countries with intervention scale
      -up against the disease. However, this resilient scourge may persist in low-grade
      submicroscopic infections among semi-immune members of the population, and be
      poised for possible resurgence, creating challenges for detection and assessment 
      of intervention impact. Parasite genotyping methods, such as the molecular
      barcode, can identify specific malaria parasite types being transmitted and allow
      tracking and evaluation of parasite population structure changes as interventions
      are applied. This current study demonstrates application of pre-amplification
      methods for successful detection and genotyping of residual Plasmodium falciparum
      infections during a dramatic malarial decline. METHODS: The study was a
      prospective cross-sectional design and based on a 2,000 sq km vicinity of Macha
      Mission Hospital in southern Zambia. Willing and predominantly asymptomatic
      residents of all ages were screened for malaria by microscopy during the 2005 and
      2008 transmission seasons, with simultaneous collection of dried blood spots
      (DBS) on filter paper, and extraction of Plasmodium falciparum DNA was performed.
      Plasmodium falciparum infections were genotyped using a 24 SNP-based molecular
      barcode assay using real-time PCR. Submicroscopic parasitaemia samples were
      subjected to pre-amplification using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix following the
      manufacturer's instructions before SNP barcode analysis. RESULTS: There was a
      dramatic decline of malaria between 2005 and 2008, and the geometric mean
      parasite density (95% CI) fell from 704/muL (390-1,271) in 2005 to 39/muL (23-68)
      in 2008, culminating in a large proportion of submicroscopic infections of which 
      90% failed to yield ample DNA for standard molecular characterization among 2008 
      samples. Pre-amplification enabled successful detection and genotyping of 74% of 
      these low-grade reservoir infections, overall, compared to 54% that were
      detectable before pre-amplification (p <0.0005, n = 84). Furthermore, nine
      samples negative for parasites by microscopy and standard quantitative PCR
      amplification were positive after pre-amplification. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pre-amplification allows analysis of an otherwise undetectable parasite
      population and may be instrumental for parasites identification, tracking and
      assessing the impact of interventions on parasite populations during malaria
      control and elimination programmes when parasitaemia is expected to decline to
      submicroscopic levels.

AB  - Molecular diagnosis of malaria by nucleotide amplification requires sophisticated
      and expensive instruments, typically found only in well-established laboratories.
      Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has provided a new platform for an 
      easily adaptable molecular technique for molecular diagnosis of malaria without
      the use of expensive instruments. A new primer set has been designed targeting
      the 18S rRNA gene for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in whole blood
      samples. The efficacy of LAMP using the new primer set was assessed in this study
      in comparison to that of a previously described set of LAMP primers as well as
      with microscopy and real-time PCR as reference methods for detecting P.
      falciparum. Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue (HNB) in the LAMP reaction
      caused a distinct color change, thereby improving the visual detection system.
      The new LAMP assay was found to be 99.1% sensitive compared to microscopy and
      98.1% when compared to real-time PCR. Meanwhile, its specificity was 99% and 100%
      in contrast to microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the LAMP
      method was in very good agreement with microscopy and real-time PCR (0.94 and
      0.98, respectively). This new LAMP method can detect at least 5parasites/muL of
      infected blood within 35min, while the other LAMP method tested in this study,
      could detect a minimum of 100parasites/muL of human blood after 60min of
      amplification. Thus, the new method is sensitive and specific, can be carried out
      in a very short time, and can substitute PCR in healthcare clinics and standard
      laboratories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive implementation of malaria diagnostics in low-resource
      countries is regarded as a pivotal strategy in control and elimination efforts.
      Although malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are considered a viable
      alternative, there are still obstacles to the widespread implementation of this
      strategy, such as reporting constraints and lack of proper quality assurance of
      RDT-based programmes at point-of-care (POC). METHODS: A prospective cohort of
      patients, seeking routine care for febrile episodes at health centres in
      malaria-endemic areas of Colombia, was used to assess the diagnostic performance 
      of a device based on smartphone technology (Deki ReaderTM, former codename
      "GenZero"), that assists users at POC to process RDTs. After informed consent,
      patients were enrolled into the study and blood samples were collected for thick 
      blood smear (TBS) and RDT. The RDT results were interpreted by both visual
      inspection and Deki Reader device and concordance between visual and device
      interpretation was measured. Microscopy corrected by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) and microscopy were "gold standard" tests to assess the diagnostic
      performance. RESULTS: In total, 1,807 patients were enrolled at seven health
      centres in malaria-endemic areas of Colombia. Thirty-three Plasmodium falciparum 
      and 100 Plasmodium vivax cases were positive by corrected microscopy. Both
      sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% CI 69.7-95.2) and 98.7% (95% CI
      98.5-99.4) for P. falciparum, and 98.0% (95% CI 90.3-98.9) and 97.9% (95% CI
      97.1-98.5) for P. vivax. Percentage concordance between visual and device
      interpretation of RDT was 98.5% and 99.0% for P. vivax and P. falciparum,
      respectively.The RDT, when compared to TBS, showed high sensitivity and
      specificity for P. falciparum in both visual and device interpretation, and good 
      overall diagnostic performance for P. vivax. Comparison between PCR as gold
      standard and visual and device interpretation showed acceptable overall
      performance for both species. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of the Deki
      Reader was comparable to visual interpretation of RDTs (without significant
      differences) for both malaria species. Providing standardized automated
      interpretation of RDTs at POC in remote areas, in addition to almost real-time
      reporting of cases and enabling quality control would greatly benefit large-scale
      implementation of RDT-based malaria diagnostic programmes.

TI  - PPARgamma agonists improve survival and neurocognitive outcomes in experimental
      cerebral malaria and induce neuroprotective pathways in human malaria.
PG  - e1003980

AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is associated with a high mortality rate, and long-term
      neurocognitive impairment in approximately one third of survivors. Adjunctive
      therapies that modify the pathophysiological processes involved in CM may improve
      outcome over anti-malarial therapy alone. PPARgamma agonists have been reported
      to have immunomodulatory effects in a variety of disease models. Here we report
      that adjunctive therapy with PPARgamma agonists improved survival and long-term
      neurocognitive outcomes in the Plasmodium berghei ANKA experimental model of CM. 
      Compared to anti-malarial therapy alone, PPARgamma adjunctive therapy
      administered to mice at the onset of CM signs, was associated with reduced
      endothelial activation, and enhanced expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes SOD-1
      and catalase and the neurotrophic factors brain derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the brains of infected mice. Two months
      following infection, mice that were treated with anti-malarials alone
      demonstrated cognitive dysfunction, while mice that received PPARgamma adjunctive
      therapy were completely protected from neurocognitive impairment and from
      PbA-infection induced brain atrophy. In humans with P. falciparum malaria,
      PPARgamma therapy was associated with reduced endothelial activation and with
      induction of neuroprotective pathways, such as BDNF. These findings provide
      insight into mechanisms conferring improved survival and preventing
      neurocognitive injury in CM, and support the evaluation of PPARgamma agonists in 
      human CM.

TI  - Artesunate plus pyronaridine for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria.
PG  - CD006404
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006404.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people with
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria are treated using Artemisinin-based
      Combination Therapy (ACT). ACT combines three-days of a short-acting artemisinin 
      derivative with a longer-acting antimalarial which has a different mode of
      action. Pyronaridine has been reported as an effective antimalarial over two
      decades of use in parts of Asia, and is currently being evaluated as a partner
      drug for artesunate. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      artesunate-pyronaridine compared to alternative ACTs for treating people with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; 
      LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); and the
      WHO International Clinical Trials Search Portal up to 16 January 2014. We
      searched reference lists and conference abstracts, and contacted experts for
      information about ongoing and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized 
      controlled trials of artesunate-pyronaridine versus other ACTs in adults and
      children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.For the safety analysis, we
      also included adverse events data from trials comparing any treatment regimen
      containing pyronaridine with regimens not containing pyronaridine. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and
      risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios 
      (RR) and continuous data using mean differences (MD), and presented all results
      with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the
      quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included six randomized controlled trials
      enrolling 3718 children and adults. Artesunate-pyronaridine versus
      artemether-lumefantrineIn two multicentre trials, enrolling mainly older children
      and adults from west and south-central Africa, both artesunate-pyronaridine and
      artemether-lumefantrine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 
      42 days of follow-up, with no differences between groups (two trials, 1472
      participants, low quality evidence). There were fewer new infections during the
      first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted treatment
      failure: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90, two trials, 1720 participants, moderate
      quality evidence), but no difference was detected over the whole 42 day follow-up
      (two trials, 1691 participants, moderate quality evidence).
      Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artesunate plus mefloquineIn one multicentre
      trial, enrolling mainly older children and adults from South East Asia, both
      artesunate-pyronaridine and artesunate plus mefloquine had fewer than 5% PCR
      adjusted treatment failures during 28 days follow-up (one trial, 1187
      participants, moderate quality evidence). PCR-adjusted treatment failures were 6%
      by day 42 for these treated with artesunate-pyronaridine, and 4% for those with
      artesunate-mefloquine (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.00, one trial, 1116
      participants, low quality evidence). Again, there were fewer new infections
      during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted
      treatment failure: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73, one trial, 1720 participants,
      moderate quality evidence), but no differences were detected over the whole 42
      days (one trial, 1146 participants, low quality evidence). Adverse effectsSerious
      adverse events were uncommon in these trials, with no difference detected between
      artesunate-pyronaridine and comparator ACTs. The analysis of liver function tests
      showed biochemical elevation were four times more frequent with
      artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (RR 4.17, 95% CI 1.38
      to 12.62, four trials, 3523 participants, moderate quality evidence). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Artesunate-pyronaridine performed well in these trials compared to
      artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate plus mefloquine, with PCR-adjusted
      treatment failure at day 28 below the 5% standard set by the WHO. Further
      efficacy and safety studies in African and Asian children are required to clarify
      whether this combination is an option for first-line treatment.

TI  - Diversifying selection on the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) gene
      of Plasmodium falciparum in Thailand.
PG  - e90522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0090522 [doi]
AB  - Sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum are transmitted to human hosts by Anopheles 
      mosquitoes. Thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) is expressed in
      sporozoites and plays a crucial role in sporozoite gliding and invasion of human 
      hepatocytes. A previous study showed that the TRAP gene has been subjected to
      balancing selection in the Gambian P. falciparum population. To further study the
      molecular evolution of the TRAP gene in Plasmodium falciparum, we investigated
      TRAP polymorphisms in P. falciparum isolates from Suan Phueng District in
      Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. The analysis of the entire TRAP coding sequences
      in 32 isolates identified a total of 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
      which comprised 37 nonsynonymous and two synonymous SNPs. McDonald-Kreitman test 
      showed that the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphic
      sites within P. falciparum was significantly higher than that of the number of
      nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed sites between P. falciparum and P. reichenowi. 
      Furthermore, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution was significantly higher than
      that of synonymous substitution within Thai P. falciparum. These results indicate
      that the TRAP gene has been subject to diversifying selection in the Thai P.
      falciparum population as well as the Gambian P. falciparum population. Comparison
      of our P. falciparum isolates with those from another region of Thailand (Tak
      province, Thailand) revealed that TRAP was highly differentiated between
      geographically close regions. This rapid diversification seems to reflect strong 
      recent positive selection on TRAP. Our results suggest that the TRAP molecule is 
      a major target of the human immune response to pre-erythrocytic stages of P.
      falciparum.

TI  - Tempol, an intracellular antioxidant, inhibits tissue factor expression,
      attenuates dendritic cell function, and is partially protective in a murine model
      of cerebral malaria.
PG  - e87140
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0087140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS) in
      pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (CM) remains incompletely understood. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We undertook testing Tempol--a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic
      and pleiotropic intracellular antioxidant--in cells relevant to malaria
      pathogenesis in the context of coagulation and inflammation. Tempol was also
      tested in a murine model of CM induced by Plasmodium berghei Anka infection.
      Tempol was found to prevent transcription and functional expression of
      procoagulant tissue factor in endothelial cells (ECs) stimulated by
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect was accompanied by inhibition of IL-6,
      IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) production. Tempol also
      attenuated platelet aggregation and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells
      oxidative burst. In dendritic cells, Tempol inhibited LPS-induced production of
      TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p70, downregulated expression of co-stimulatory
      molecules, and prevented antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. Notably,
      Tempol (20 mg/kg) partially increased the survival of mice with CM.
      Mechanistically, treated mice had lowered plasma levels of MCP-1, suggesting that
      Tempol downmodulates EC function and vascular inflammation. Tempol also
      diminished blood brain barrier permeability associated with CM when started at
      day 4 post infection but not at day 1, suggesting that ROS production is tightly 
      regulated. Other antioxidants-such as alpha-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN;
      a spin trap), MnTe-2-PyP and MnTBAP (Mn-phorphyrin), Mitoquinone (MitoQ) and
      Mitotempo (mitochondrial antioxidants), M30 (an iron chelator), and
      epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; polyphenol from green tea) did not improve
      survival. By contrast, these compounds (except PBN) inhibited Plasmodium
      falciparum growth in culture with different IC50s. Knockout mice for SOD1 or
      phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
      (gp91(phox-/-)) or mice treated with inhibitors of SOD (diethyldithiocarbamate)
      or NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium) did not show protection or exacerbation
      for CM. CONCLUSION: Results with Tempol suggest that intracellular ROS
      contribute, in part, to CM pathogenesis. Therapeutic targeting of intracellular
      ROS in CM is discussed.

TI  - Mitochondrial genome of Babesia orientalis, apicomplexan parasite of water
      buffalo (Bubalus babalis, Linnaeus, 1758) endemic in China.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-82 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apicomplexan parasites of the genus Babesia, Theileria and Plasmodium
      are very closely related organisms. Interestingly, their mitochondrial (mt)
      genomes are highly divergent. Among Babesia, Babesia orientalis is a new species 
      recently identified and specifically epidemic to the southern part of China,
      causing severe disease to water buffalo. However, no information on the mt genome
      of B. orientalis was available. METHODS: Four pairs of primers were designed
      based on the full genome sequence of B. orientalis (unpublished data) and by
      aligning reported mt genomes of B. bovis, B. bigemina, and T. parva. The entire
      mt genome was amplified by four sets of PCR. The obtained mt genome was annotated
      by aligning with published apicomplexan mt genomes and Artemis software v11.
      Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using cox1 and cob amino acid sequences.
      RESULTS: The complete mt genome of B. orientalis (Wuhan strain) was sequenced and
      characterized. The entire mt genome is 5996 bp in length with a linear form,
      containing three protein-coding genes including cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1),
      cytochrome b (cob) and cytochrome c oxidase III (cox3) and six rRNA large subunit
      gene fragments. The gene arrangement in B. orientalis mt genome is similar to
      those of B. bovis, B. gibsoni and Theileria parva, but different from those of T.
      orientalis, T. equi and Plasmodium falciparum. Comparative analysis indicated
      that cox1 and cob genes were more conserved than cox3. Phylogenetic analysis
      based on amino acid sequences of cox1, cob and cox1 + cob, respectively, revealed
      that B. orientalis fell into Babesia clade with the closest relationship to B.
      bovis. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of the entire mt genome sequences of B.
      orientalis provides valuable information for future phylogenetic, population
      genetics and molecular epidemiological studies of apicomplexan parasites.

LID - 10.1128/JCM.03313-13 [doi]
AB  - The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, developed by our group 
      for diagnosis of four human malaria parasites, was evaluated on a large scale at 
      a remote clinic in Thailand where malaria is endemic. A total of 899 febrile
      patients were analyzed in this study. LAMP was first evaluated in 219 patients,
      and the result was compared to those of two histidine-rich protein (HRP)-2 rapid 
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy as a gold standard. LAMP DNA extraction
      was conducted by a simple boiling method, and the test results were assessed
      visually. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
      predictive value (NPV) were 95.7%, 100%, 100%, and 98%, respectively, for LAMP
      and 98.6%, 98%, 95.8%, and 99.3%, respectively, for RDTs. Since RDT-positive
      results were based on one out of two RDTs, the sensitivity of RDTs was slightly
      higher than that of LAMP. However, LAMP tended to be more specific than RDTs.
      LAMP next was evaluated in 680 patients, and the result was compared to that of
      microscopy as a gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic
      accuracy of LAMP were 88.9%, 96.9%, 92.2%, 95.5%, and 94.6%, respectively. Nested
      PCR was used to confirm the discrepant results. Malaria LAMP in a remote clinic
      in Thailand achieved an acceptable result, indicating that LAMP malaria diagnosis
      is feasible in a field setting with limited technical resources. Additionally,
      the rapid boiling method for extracting DNA from dried blood spots proved to be
      simple, fast, and suitable for use in the field.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-14-109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the current complement to
      microscopy for ensuring prompt malaria treatment. We determined the performance
      of three candidate RDTs (Paracheck-Pf, SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf and SD Bioline
      malaria Ag-Pf/pan) for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the Central African
      Republic. METHODS: Blood samples from consecutive febrile patients who attended
      for laboratory analysis of malaria at the three main health centres of Bangui
      were screened by microscopy and the RDTs. Two reference standards were used to
      assess the performance of the RDTs: microscopy and, a combination of microscopy
      plus nested PCR for slides reported as negative, on the assumption that negative 
      results by microscopy were due to sub-patent parasitaemia. RESULTS: We analysed
      436 samples. Using the combined reference standard of microscopy + PCR, the
      sensitivity of Paracheck-Pf was 85.7% (95% CI, 80.8-89.8%), that of SD Bioline
      Ag-Pf was 85.4% (95% CI, 80.5-90.7%), and that of SD Bioline Ag-Pf/pan was 88.2% 
      (95% CI, 83.2-92.0%). The tests performed less well in cases of low parasitaemia;
      however, the sensitivity was > 95% at > 500 parasites/mul. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 
      SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf and SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf/pan performed slightly
      better than Paracheck-Pf. Use of RDTs with reinforced microscopy practice and
      laboratory quality assurance should improve malaria treatment in the Central
      African Republic.

      (AM) and categorized by microscopy as adequate clinical and parasitological
      response (ACPR), using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Dried blood spots were
      collected at day 0 and day 28 and stevor gene amplification was performed to
      detect Plasmodium falciparum infections. Plasmodial DNA was found in 27.5%
      (n=19/69) of the isolates collected at day 28; this proportion was 34.3%
      (n=12/35) in the SP group and 20.6% (n=7/34) in the AM group. This study
      underlines the need of an accurate and more appropriate technique such as PCR to 
      evaluate antimalarial drug efficacy during clinical trials.

      with Plasmodium knowlesi.
PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-60 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of Southeast Asian macaques, 
      infects humans and can cause fatal malaria. It is difficult to diagnose by
      microscopy because of morphological similarity to Plasmodium malariae. Nested PCR
      assay is the most accurate method to distinguish P. knowlesi from other
      Plasmodium species but is not cost effective in resource-poor settings. Rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) are recommended for settings where malaria is prevalent. 
      In this study, the effectiveness of three RDTs in detecting P. knowlesi from
      fresh and frozen patient blood samples was evaluated. METHODS: Forty malaria
      patients (28 P. knowlesi, ten P. vivax and two P. falciparum) diagnosed by
      microscopy were recruited in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo during a 16-month period. 
      Patient blood samples were used to determine parasitaemia by microscopy, confirm 
      the Plasmodium species present by PCR and evaluate three RDTs: OptiMAL-IT,
      BinaxNOW(R) Malaria and Paramax-3. The RDTs were also evaluated using frozen
      blood samples from 41 knowlesi malaria patients. RESULTS: OptiMAL-IT was the most
      sensitive RDT, with a sensitivity of 71% (20/28; 95% CI = 54-88%) for fresh and
      73% (30/41; 95% CI = 59-87%) for frozen knowlesi samples. However, it yielded
      predominantly falciparum-positive results due to cross-reactivity of the P.
      falciparum test reagent with P. knowlesi. BinaxNOW(R) Malaria correctly detected 
      non-P. falciparum malaria in P. knowlesi samples but was the least sensitive,
      detecting only 29% (8/28; 95% CI = 12-46%) of fresh and 24% (10/41; 95% CI =
      11-37%) of frozen samples. The Paramax-3 RDT tested positive for P. vivax with
      PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi samples with sensitivities of 40% (10/25; 95% CI =
      21-59%) with fresh and 32% (13/41; 95% CI = 17-46%) with frozen samples. All RDTs
      correctly identified P. falciparum- and P. vivax-positive controls with
      parasitaemias above 2,000 parasites/mul blood. CONCLUSIONS: The RDTs detected
      Plasmodium in P. knowlesi-infected blood samples with poor sensitivity and
      specificity. Patients with P. knowlesi could be misdiagnosed as P. falciparum
      with OptiMAL-IT, P. vivax with Paramax-3 and more correctly as non-P.
      vivax/non-P. falciparum with BinaxNOW(R) Malaria. There is a need for a sensitive
      and specific RDT for malaria diagnosis in settings where P. knowlesi infections
      predominate.

TI  - Contrasting Plasmodium infection rates and insecticide susceptibility profiles
      between the sympatric sibling species Anopheles parensis and Anopheles funestus
      s.s: a potential challenge for malaria vector control in Uganda.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the An. funestus group conceals one of the major malaria
      vectors in Africa, little is known about the dynamics of members of this group
      across the continent. Here, we investigated the species composition, infection
      rate and susceptibility to insecticides of this species group in Uganda. METHODS:
      Indoor resting blood-fed Anopheles adult female mosquitoes were collected from 3 
      districts in Uganda. Mosquitoes morphologically belonging to the An. funestus
      group were identified to species by PCR. The sporozoite infection rates were
      determined by TaqMan and a nested PCR. Susceptibility to major insecticides was
      assessed using WHO bioassays. The potential role of four candidate resistance
      genes was assessed using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: An. funestus s.s. and An. parensis,
      were the only members of the An. funestus group identified. Both species were
      sympatric in Masindi (North-West), whereas only An. parensis was present in
      Mityana (Central) and Ntungamo (South-West). The Plasmodium falciparum infection 
      detected in An. parensis (4.2%) by TaqMan could not be confirmed by nested PCR,
      whereas the 5.3% infection in An. funestus s.s. was confirmed. An. parensis was
      susceptible to most insecticides, however, a moderate resistance was observed
      against deltamethrin and DDT. In the sympatric population of Masindi, resistance 
      was observed to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) and DDT, but all the
      resistant mosquitoes belonged to An. funestus s.s. No significant over-expression
      was observed for the four P450 candidate genes CYP6M7, CYP9K1, CYP6P9 and CYP6AA4
      between deltamethrin resistant and control An. parensis. However, when compared
      with the susceptible FANG An. funestus s.s strain, the CYP9K1 is significantly
      over-expressed in An. parensis (15-fold change; P < 0.001), suggesting it could
      play a role in the deltamethrin resistance. CONCLUSION: The contrasting infection
      rates and insecticide susceptibility profiles of both species highlights the
      importance of accurate species identification for successful vector control
      programs.

AB  - Two hundred and seventy four asymptomatic Ghanaian school-children aged 5 to 17
      years were screened for malaria parasites by examination of blood films. One
      hundred and fifty five microscopically-positive individuals were treated with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and followed for 3 weeks. Retrospective
      species-specific PCR of all 274 screened samples identified an additional 60
      children with sub-patent parasitaemia, and a substantial proportion of
      co-infections with Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium
      ovale wallikeri. One hundred individuals harboured at least one non-falciparum
      parasite species. Using standard double-read microscopy, the 21-day efficacy of
      treatment against Plasmodium falciparum was 91.4% among the 117 children seen at 
      all 5 visits. Using nested PCR to test 152 visit 5 blood samples, 22 were found
      to be parasite-positive. Twenty individuals harboured P. falciparum, four
      harboured P. ovale spp. and two P. malariae, with four of these 22 isolates being
      mixed species infections. The persistent detection of low density Plasmodium sp. 
      infections following antimalarial treatment suggests these may be a hitherto
      unrecognised obstacle to malaria elimination.

TI  - Hot spot or not: a comparison of spatial statistical methods to predict
      prospective malaria infections.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within affected communities, Plasmodium falciparum infections may be 
      skewed in distribution such that single or small clusters of households
      consistently harbour a disproportionate number of infected individuals throughout
      the year. Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit
      targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across
      the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods 
      of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using
      different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA-1 and MSP-1 antibodies) for prediction 
      of infection the following year. METHODS: Two full surveys of four villages in
      Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010-2011. In both
      surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In
      addition in 2010, serologic markers (AMA-1 and MSP-119 antibodies) of exposure
      were assessed. Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were
      assessed using three geospatial methods: spatial scan statistics, kernel analysis
      and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to
      predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic
      regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve
      (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of
      varying radius size for the kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and
      maximum population size for the spatial scan statistic. RESULTS: Guided by AUC
      values, the kernel method and spatial scan statistics appeared to be more
      predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of PCR-detected infection
      and seropositivity to AMA-1 were predictive of subsequent infection. For the
      kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing hotspots to contain
      up to 50% of the population was a better predictor of infection in the second
      year using spatial scan statistics than smaller maximum population sizes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of AMA-1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are
      predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models.
      Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and spatial scan statistics both provided
      accurate prediction of future infection.

TI  - Two Plasmodium 6-Cys family-related proteins have distinct and critical roles in 
      liver-stage development.
PG  - 2158-70
LID - 10.1096/fj.13-241570 [doi]
AB  - The 10 Plasmodium 6-Cys proteins have critical roles throughout parasite
      development and are targets for antimalaria vaccination strategies. We analyzed
      the conserved 6-cysteine domain of this family and show that only the last 4
      positionally conserved cysteine residues are diagnostic for this domain and
      identified 4 additional "6-Cys family-related" proteins. Two of these, sequestrin
      and B9, are critical to Plasmodium liver-stage development. RT-PCR and
      immunofluorescence assays show that B9 is translationally repressed in
      sporozoites and is expressed after hepatocyte invasion where it localizes to the 
      parasite plasma membrane. Mutants lacking B9 expression in the rodent malaria
      parasites P. berghei and P. yoelii and the human parasite P. falciparum
      developmentally arrest in hepatocytes. P. berghei mutants arrest in the livers of
      BALB/c (100%) and C57BL6 mice (>99.9%), and in cultures of Huh7 human-hepatoma
      cell line. Similarly, P. falciparum mutants while fully infectious to primary
      human hepatocytes abort development 3 d after infection. This growth arrest is
      associated with a compromised parasitophorous vacuole membrane a phenotype
      similar to, but distinct from, mutants lacking the 6-Cys sporozoite proteins P52 
      and P36. Our results show that 6-Cys proteins have critical but distinct roles in
      establishment and maintenance of a parasitophorous vacuole and subsequent
      liver-stage development.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted malaria is a severe disease with high fatality rate. Most
      Brazilian blood banks in the Amazon region perform malaria screening using
      microscopic examination (thick smears). Since low parasite concentrations are
      expected in asymptomatic blood donors a high sensitivity test should be used for 
      donor screening. This study determined the sensitivity of a nested-PCR for
      plasmodium detection in pooled samples. We performed a one-stage criterion
      validation study with 21 positive samples pooled with samples from ten negative
      volunteer until three different concentrations were reached (0.33; 0.25; 0.20
      parasites/muL - p/muL). Nested PCR was performed as described by Snounou et al.
      (1993). Sensitivities (and confidence intervals) were determined by stratum of
      final parasite concentration on the pooled samples. All samples with parasitemia 
      values of 0.33 and 0.25 p/muL had 100% sensitivity (95%CI=86.3-100). One negative
      result was obtained from a sample with 0.20 p/muL sensitivity=95.2%
      (95%CI=76.2-99.9). Compared to parasitemia detectable under ideal conditions of
      thick smear, this nested-PCR in pooled sample was able to detect 40 times more
      parasites per microliter. Nested-PCR in pooled samples should be considered as a 
      high sensitive alternative to thick smear for donor screening in blood banks at

AB  - BACKGROUND: With 75% of the Ethiopian population at risk of malaria, accurate
      diagnosis is crucial for malaria treatment in endemic areas where Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax co-exist. The present study evaluated the
      performance of regular microscopy in accurate identification of Plasmodium spp.
      in febrile patients visiting health facilities in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study design was employed to recruit study subjects who were
      microscopically positive for malaria parasites and attending health facilities in
      southern Ethiopia between August and December 2011. Of the 1,416 febrile patients
      attending primary health facilities, 314 febrile patients, whose slides were
      positive for P. falciparum, P. vivax or mixed infections using microscopy, were
      re-evaluated for their infection status by PCR. Finger-prick blood samples were
      used for parasite genomic DNA extraction. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to
      reconstruct the distribution of different Plasmodium spp. across the three
      geographical areas. RESULTS: Of the 314 patients with a positive thick blood
      smear, seven patients (2%) were negative for any of the Plasmodium spp. by nested
      PCR. Among 180 microscopically diagnosed P. falciparum cases, 111 (61.7%) were
      confirmed by PCR, 44 (24.4%) were confirmed as P. vivax, 18 (10%) had mixed
      infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax and two (1.1%) were mixed infections
      with P. falciparum and P. malariae and five (2.8%) were negative for any of the
      Plasmodium spp. Of 131 microscopically diagnosed P. vivax cases, 110 (84%) were
      confirmed as P. vivax, 14 (10.7%) were confirmed as P. falciparum, two (1.5%)
      were P. malariae, three (2.3%) with mixed infections with P. falciparum and P.
      vivax and two (1.5%) were negative for any of the Plasmodium spp. Plasmodium
      falciparum and P. vivax mixed infections were observed. Plasmodium malariae was
      detected as mono and mixed infections in four individuals. CONCLUSION: False
      positivity, under-reporting of mixed infections and a significant number of
      species mismatch needs attention and should be improved for appropriate
      diagnosis. The detection of substantial number of false positive results by
      molecular methodologies may provide the accurate incidence of circulating
      Plasmodium species in the geographical region and has important repercussions in 
      understanding malaria epidemiology and subsequent control.

TI  - Cardiovascular involvement in severe vivax and falciparum malaria.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Recently, vivax malaria is also presenting as severe
      malaria causing multiorgan dysfunction similar to falciparum malaria. The present
      study was undertaken to evaluate the involvement of cardiovascular system in
      severe malaria. METHODS: This is a clinical prospective study conducted on the
      cases of severe malaria in S.P. Medical College and PBM Hospital, Bikaner, India.
      In total, 100 cases (45 males, 55 females; age range 13-75 yr) of severe malaria 
      (P. vivax 60; P. falciparum 28; and mixed 12) diagnosed by peripheral blood smear
      examination, rapid card test and PCR were studied. Evaluation of cardiovascular
      system was done by clinical examination, chest Xray, ECG, high resolution
      transthoracic echocardiography and estimation of cardiac markers. RESULTS: In
      all, 17% cases (9 P. falciparum, 5 P. vivax and 3 mixed) were found to be
      suffering from cardiovascular involvement (11% circulatory failure, 7% congestive
      cardiac failure and 2% pulmonary edema). ECG showed sinus tachycardia in all the 
      17 patients, one had atrial ectopic and eight had non-specific ST-T changes.
      Cardiomegaly was seen in eight cases and pulmonary edema in two on X-ray chest.
      Echocardiography was within normal range but cardiac dimensions were increased in
      all the 17 cases. Troponin-I and CPK-MB were increased in 14 cases.
      Cardiovascular involvement in P. falciparum and mixed infection was associated
      with high parasite density but P. vivax infection was associated with relatively 
      low parasite density. Involvement of cardiovascular system was associated with
      increased hospital stay (7.67 +/- 2.23 vs 6.59 +/- 0.87 days; p <0.001) and high 
      mortality (5 died out of 17 patients). Significant ECG changes and cardiac
      markers indicate myocardial involvement in severe malaria. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: The present study indicates involvement of cardiovascular system in
      severe malaria as evidenced by changes in ECG and cardiac markers (Trop 1 and
      CPK-MB). The present study also highlights that vivax malaria is no more benign
      and pathophysiology of vivax malaria should be re-evaluated.

TI  - Safety, efficacy and population pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose combination of
      artesunate-mefloquine in the treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in India.
PG  - 258-64
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: India has switched over to artemisinin-based combination
      therapy (ACT) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria and the ACT used in the national programme is artesunate +
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Since the efficacy of ACT is dependent also on the
      partner drug, there is a need to evaluate and deploy multiple ACTs. METHODS: This
      multicentre, single-arm, open-label clinical trial was carried out to assess the 
      efficacy, safety and population pharmacokinetics of a fixed dose combination
      (FDC) artesunate mefloquine (ASMQ) in P. falciparum infected, Indian adults at
      Panjim, Goa, and Mangalore, Karnataka between December 2007 and November 2008.
      RESULTS: A total of 77 patients (males 74) were screened and enrolled: 42 at Goa 
      and 35 at Mangalore with a median age of 25 yr (range 18-55 yr). One patient
      failed in treatment on D53, a PCR proven new infection, seven developed recurrent
      vivax parasitaemia and 11 did not have a parasitological endpoint. By per
      protocol analysis, the D63 cure rate was 58/59 (98.3; 95% C.I. 90.9-99.9%), and
      58/58, with PCR correction. ASMQ was well-tolerated and no serious adverse events
      were reported. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study showed that the ASMQ FDC
      was efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria in highly endemic, chloroquine resistant areas of Goa and
      Mangalore. It is a viable option for India.

TI  - Effectiveness of artesunate-amodiaquine vs. artemether-lumefantrine for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nanoro, Burkina Faso: a
      non-inferiority randomised trial.
PG  - 469-75
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12274 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are essential for the 
      effective control of falciparum malaria in endemic countries. However, in most
      countries, such choice has been carried out without knowing their effectiveness
      when deployed in real-life conditions, that is, when treatment is not directly
      observed. We report here the results of a study assessing the effectiveness of
      the two ACTs currently recommended in Burkina Faso for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria, that is, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and
      artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ). METHODS: Between September 2008 and January 2010, 
      340 children were randomised to one of the two study arms and followed up for 42 
      days. Treatment was administered according to routine practices, that is, the
      first dose was given by study nurses who explained to the parent/guardian how to 
      administer the other doses at home during the following 2 days. RESULTS: The
      results showed a significantly higher unadjusted adequate clinical and
      parasitological response in the ASAQ (58.4%) than in the AL arm (46.1%) at day 28
      but these trends were similar after correction with PCR data (ASAQ (89.7%) and AL
      (89.8%)). New infections started to appear after day 14, first in the AL and then
      in the ASAQ arm but at day 42 day of follow-up we observed no difference in the
      occurrence of recrudescent infection. CONCLUSION: Despite a lower cure rate than 
      those reported in efficacy studies in which the treatment administration was
      directly observed, both AL and ASAQ can still be used for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.

AB  - Most of the complications of malaria such as anaemia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice,
      and renal failure are commonly found in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the
      incidence of severe and complicated vivax malaria tends to be increasing. We
      report two cases of severe Plasmodium vivax malaria from Malang, a nonendemic
      area in Indonesia. Patients exhibited anaemia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, renal 
      disturbance, and melena. Microscopic peripheral blood examination and
      amplification of parasite 18s rRNA by polymerase chain reaction showed the
      presence of P. vivax and absence of P. falciparum. All patients responded well to
      antimalarial drugs.

      (typically histidine-rich protein 2 [HRP2]). METHODS: Phase 1: 2,000 children,
      two months to five years of age, admitted to a referral hospital in Jinja,
      Uganda, with acute febrile illness were enrolled. A WHO highly rated three-band
      RDT was compared to light microscopy of thick peripheral blood films read by
      local expert microscopists.Phase 2: the three-band RDT was used as a screening
      tool for inclusion of patients in a clinical trial, and subjects with three
      positive RDT bands were tested by microscopy using blood samples drawn in
      parallel. Discordant results were adjudicated by PCR. RESULTS: Phase 1: 1,648
      children had both a RDT and peripheral blood smear performed. The specificity of 
      a RDT with all three bands positive was 82% (95% CI: 79-85%) compared to 62% (95%
      CI: 59-66%) for HRP2 alone. The sensitivity was 88% (95% CI: 85-89%) and 94% (95%
      CI: 92-95%) for three-band positive RDT and HRP2 antigen, respectively. 119
      patients (7.2%) had a positive HRP2 band, but negative parasite lactate
      dehydrogenase (pLHD) band and negative peripheral smear, and 72 (61%) of these
      had received pre-treatment with anti-malarials, suggesting a false positive HRP2 
      result (p = 0.002).Phase 2: the positive predictive value (PPV) of the three-band
      RDT was 94% (95% CI 89%-97%) using microscopy as the reference standard. However,
      microscopy-discordant results were shown to be positive for P. falciparum by PCR 
      in all cases, suggesting that the PPV was in fact higher. CONCLUSION: The pLDH
      antigen on three-band RDTs, used in combination with HRP2, provides added
      diagnostic specificity for malaria parasitaemia and may be useful to distinguish 
      acute infection from recently treated infection. In situations where diagnostic
      specificity is desirable (e.g., for selection of malaria-infected participants in
      clinical trials), a three-band RDT should be considered in a sub-Saharan African 
      setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Senegalese National Malaria Control Programme has recommended use
      of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that target the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2),
      specific to Plasmodium falciparum, to diagnose malaria cases. The target antigen 
      has been shown to be polymorphic, which may explain the variability in HRP2-based
      RDT results reported in field studies. The genetic diversity of the pfhrp2 gene
      has not been investigated in depth in many African countries. The goal of this
      study is to determine the extent of polymorphism in pfhrp2 among Senegal, Mali
      and Uganda parasite populations, and discuss the implications of these findings
      on the utility of RDTs that are based on HRP2 detection. METHODS: Sequencing data
      from the pfhrp2 locus were used to analyze the genetic diversity of this gene
      among three populations, with different transmission dynamics and malaria
      parasite ecologies. Nucleotide diversity (pi) and non-synonymous nucleotide
      diversity (piNS) were studied in the pfhrp2 gene from isolates obtained in
      Senegal. Amino acid repeat length polymorphisms in the PfHRP2 antigen were
      characterized and parameters of genetic diversity, such as frequency and
      correlation between repeats in these populations, were assessed. RESULTS: The
      diversity survey of the pfhrp2 gene identified 29 SNPs as well as insertion and
      deletion polymorphisms within a 918 bp region. The Senegal pfhrp2 exhibited a
      substantial level of diversity [pi = 0.00559 and piNS = 0.014111 (piS =
      0.0291627)], similar to several polymorphic genes, such as msp1, involved in
      immune responses, and the gene encoding the SURFIN polymorphic antigen, which are
      surface exposed parasite proteins. Extensive repeat length polymorphisms in
      PfHRP2, as well as similar patterns in the number, organization and the type of
      predicted amino acid repeats were observed among the three populations,
      characterized by an occurrence of Type 2, Type 4 and Type 7 repeats. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results warrant deeper monitoring of the RDT target antigen diversity and
      emphasize that development of other essential genes as a target for diagnostic
      tools is critical.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kenyan
      children aged less than five years: results of an open-label, randomized,
      single-centre study.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This open-label, randomized study evaluated efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in treatment
      of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children below five years of age, to build
      evidence on use of AL as first-line treatment and DP as second-line treatment in 
      Kenya. METHODS: A total of 454 children aged six to 59 months with uncomplicated 
      falciparum malaria were randomized (1:1) to receive AL dispersible or DP
      paediatric tablets and followed up for 42 days. Primary efficacy variable was
      corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate on day 28.
      Secondary variables included corrected (day 14, 28 and 42), uncorrected (day 3,
      14, 28 and 42) cure rates, parasitological failure at days 3, 14 and 42.
      Acceptability and tolerability of both drugs were assessed by caregiver
      questionnaire. RESULTS: On day 28, corrected ACPR rates for AL dispersible and DP
      paediatric were 97.8% (95% CI: 94.9-99.3) and 99.1% (95% CI: 96.8-99.9),
      respectively, in intention-to-treat population, with no significant treatment
      differences noted between AL dispersible and DP paediatric arms. Additionally, no
      significant differences were observed for PCR corrected cure rates on days 14 and
      ACPR on day 42 for AL dispersible (100%; 96.8%) and DP paediatric (100%; 98.7%). 
      Similarly, for PCR uncorrected cure rates, no significant differences were seen
      on days 3, 14, 28, and 42 for AL dispersible (99.1%; 98.7%; 81.1%; 67.8%) and DP 
      paediatric (100%; 100%; 87.7%; 70.5%). Parasite clearance was rapid, with
      approximately 90% clearance achieved in 40 hours in both treatment arms.
      Incidence of adverse events was related to underlying disease; malaria being
      reported in both treatment arms. One serious adverse event was noted in AL
      dispersible (0.42%) arm, not related to study drug. Adherence to treatment
      regimen was higher for children treated with AL dispersible (93.6%) compared to
      DP paediatric (85.6%). Acceptability of AL dispersible regimen was assessed as
      being significantly better than DP paediatric. CONCLUSIONS: AL and DP were both
      efficacious and well tolerated, and had similar effects at day 42 on risk of
      recurrent malaria. No signs of Plasmodium falciparum tolerance to artemisinins
      were noted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PACTR201111000316370.

PG  - 401-5
AB  - The present study evaluates the performance of OptiMAL-IT test and nested PCR
      assay in detection of malaria parasites. A total of 76 randomly selected blood
      samples collected from two malaria endemic areas were tested for malaria
      parasites using microscopy and OptiMAL-IT test in the field. PCR assays were
      performed in the laboratory using DNA extracted from blood spots of the same
      samples collected on the FTA classic cards. Of the total of 61 field confirmed
      malaria positive samples, only 58 (95%) were detected positive using microscopy
      in the laboratory. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative 
      predictive value and false discovery rate of OptiMal-IT in comparison to the
      microscopy were 93%, 83%, 95%, 79% and 5%, respectively. On the other hand, the
      sensitivity and specificity of PCR assay were 97% and 100%, respectively, whereas
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false discovery rate
      were 100%, 90% and 0%, respectively. The overall performance of OptiMal-IT and
      PCR assays for malaria diagnosis was 76% and 97%, respectively. PCR assay enabled
      the identification of infection with Plasmodium malariae Laveran, 1881 in four
      samples misidentified by microscopy and Plasmodium-specific antigen (PAN)
      identified by the OptiMAL-IT test. In addition to the standard methods, such PCR 
      assay could be useful to obtain the real incidence of each malaria parasite
      species for epidemiological perspectives.

TI  - Field evaluation of the photo-induced electron transfer fluorogenic primers (PET)
      real-time PCR for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Tanzania.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of malaria infections remains challenging,
      especially in the identification of submicroscopic infections. New molecular
      diagnostic tools that are inexpensive, sensitive enough to detect low-level
      infections and suitable in laboratory settings of resource-limited countries are 
      required for malaria control and elimination programmes. Here the diagnostic
      potential of a recently developed photo-induced electron transfer fluorogenic
      primer (PET) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) called PET-PCR was
      investigated. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the use of this assay as a method 
      for the detection of both Plasmodium falciparum and other Plasmodium species
      infections in a developing country's diagnostic laboratory; and, (ii) determine
      the assay's sensitivity and specificity compared to a nested 18S rRNA PCR.
      METHODS: Samples used in this study were obtained from a previous study conducted
      in the region of Iringa, Tanzania. A total of 303 samples from eight health
      facilities in Tanzania were utilized for this evaluation. All samples were
      screened using the multiplex PET-PCR assay designed to detect Plasmodium genus
      and P. falciparum initially in laboratory in Tanzania and then repeated at a
      reference laboratory at the CDC in the USA. Microscopy data was available for all
      the 303 samples. A subset of the samples were tested in a blinded fashion to find
      the sensitivity and specificity of the PET-PCR compared to the nested 18S rRNA
      PCR. RESULTS: Compared to microscopy, the PET-PCR assay was 59% more sensitive in
      detecting P. falciparum infections. The observed sensitivity and specificity were
      100% (95% confidence interval (CI0.95) = 94-100%) and (CI0.95 = 96-100%),
      respectively, for the PET-PCR assay when compared to nested 18S rRNA PCR. When
      compared to 18S rRNA PCR, microscopy had a low sensitivity of 40% (CI0.95 =
      23-61%) and specificity of 100% (CI0.95 = 96-100%). The PET-PCR results performed
      in the field laboratory in Tanzania were in 100% concordance with the results
      obtained at the reference laboratory in the USA. CONCLUSION: The PET-PCR is a new
      molecular diagnostic tool with similar performance characteristics as commonly
      used PCR methods that is less expensive, easy to use, and amiable to large
      scale-surveillance studies in developing country settings.

AB  - One of the major concerns in treating malaria by conventional small drug
      molecules is the rapid emergence of drug resistance. Specific silencing of
      essential genes by antisense oliogomers has been proposed as an alternative
      approach that may result in antimalarial activity which is not associated with
      drug resistance. In addition, such an approach could be an important biological
      tool for studying many genes' function by reverse genetics. Here we present a
      novel methodology of using peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a useful tool for gene
      silencing in Plasmodium falciparum. PNAs, designed as specific antisense
      molecules, were conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide (CPP); namely,
      octa-D-lysine via the C-terminus, to allow facile delivery through cell
      membranes. PNAs added to P. falciparum cultures were found exclusively in
      infected erythrocytes and were eventually localized in nuclei of the parasites at
      all stages of intra erythrocytic development. We show that these PNAs
      specifically down regulated both a stably expressed transgene as well as an
      endogenous essential gene, which significantly reduced parasites' viability. This
      study paves the way for a simple approach to silence a variety of P. falciparum
      genes as means of deciphering their function and potentially to develop highly
      specific and potent antimalarial agents.

AB  - Among vaccines, those that have an impact on transmission are in priority for
      malaria elimination and eradication. One of the new identified
      transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) candidate antigens is Generative Cell
      Specific 1 (GCS1) located on the male gametocytes of Plasmodium species. Since
      the antigenic diversity could hamper vaccine development, it is essential to
      determine the gene diversity of gcs1 in global malaria-endemic areas in order to 
      develop efficient TBVs. Therefore, in this study, nucleotide diversity and
      selection in the Plasmodium falciparum GCS1 (PfGCS1) antigen were analyzed in 36 
      Iranian clinical isolates by using PCR sequencing in order to provide useful
      information on this TBV candidate antigen. For this purpose, successful sequence 
      analysis was carried out in 36 isolates. The results showed three
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms including one synonymous (G1475A) and two
      non-synonymous (A697G and G1479A) mutations leading to 3 distinct haplotypes with
      different frequencies: GCS1-A (N184/D445, 16.7%), GCS1-B (S184/D445, 63.9%), and 
      GCS1-C (N184/N445, 19.4%). The overall nucleotide diversity (pi) for all 36
      sequences of Iranian pfgcs1 was 0.00066+/-0.00012, and the dN-dS value (-0.00028)
      was negative, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection in this gene.
      Epitope mapping prediction of PfGCS1 antigen showed that most of the potential
      linear and conformational B-cell epitopes are located in conserved regions.
      However, N184S and D445N mutations were also involved in linear and
      conformational B-cell epitopes, respectively that should be considered in vaccine
      design. In conclusion, the present study showed a very low genetic diversity of
      pfgcs1 gene among Iranian isolates. Considering PfGCS1 as a conserved TBV
      candidate, our data provides valuable information to develop a PfGCS1-based TBV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been extensively
      studied in various parts of the world. However, limited data are available from
      Mauritania. The present study examined and compared the genetic diversity of P.
      falciparum isolates in Mauritania. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates blood 
      samples were collected from 113 patients attending health facilities in
      Nouakchott and Hodh El Gharbi regions. K1, Mad20 and RO33 allelic family of msp-1
      gene were determined by nested PCR amplification. RESULTS: K1 family was the
      predominant allelic type carried alone or in association with Ro33 and Mad20
      types (90%; 102/113). Out of the 113 P. falciparum samples, 93(82.3%) harboured
      more than one parasite genotype. The overall multiplicity of infection was 3.2
      genotypes per infection. There was no significant correlation between
      multiplicity of infection and age of patients. A significant increase of
      multiplicity of infection was correlated with parasite densities. CONCLUSIONS:
      The polymorphism of P. falciparum populations from Mauritania was high. Infection
      with multiple P. falciparum clones was observed, as well as a high multiplicity
      of infection reflecting both the high endemicity level and malaria transmission
      in Mauritania.

      Malaria in Children Less Than 14 Years in Ngaoundere, North Cameroon: Efficacy,
      Safety, and Baseline Drug Resistant Mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfdhfr Genes.
PG  - 234683
LID - 10.1155/2013/234683 [doi]
AB  - Background. In Cameroon, both Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are used as first-line treatment against
      uncomplicated malaria in line with the WHO recommendations. We compared the
      efficacy and safety of both therapeutic combinations and determined the
      prevalence of drug resistance conferring mutations in three parasite genes.
      Methods. One hundred and fifty acute malaria patients between six months and 14
      years of age were randomized to receive standard doses of either AS/AQ (73) or AL
      (77) and followedup for 28 days. Outcome of treatment was according to the
      standard WHO classification. DNA samples from pretreatment parasite isolates were
      used to determine the prevalence of resistant mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
      dhfr genes. Results. Both drug combinations induced rapid clearance of parasites 
      and malaria symptoms. PCR-corrected cure rates were 100% and 96.4% for AL. The
      combinations were well tolerated. Major haplotypes included CVIET (71%), CVMNT
      (25%) for the pfcrt; SND (100%) for the pfmdr1; IRN (79, 8%), NCS (8.8%), and
      mixed haplotype (11, 8%) for the dhfr. Conclusion. Both AS/AQ and AL were highly 
      effective and well tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. High prevalence of mutant pfcrt alleles confirms
      earlier observations. Long-term monitoring of safety and efficacy and molecular
      markers is highly solicited.

PG  - 1292-4
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu005 [doi]
AB  - Individuals living in endemic areas generally harbour multiple parasite strains. 
      Multiplicity of infection (MOI) can be an indicator of immune status and
      transmission intensity. It has a potentially confounding effect on a number of
      population genetic analyses, which often assume isolates are clonal. Polymerase
      chain reaction-based approaches to estimate MOI can lack sensitivity. For
      example, in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, genotyping of the
      merozoite surface protein (MSP1/2) genes is a standard method for assessing MOI, 
      despite the apparent problem of underestimation. The availability of deep
      coverage data from massively parallizable sequencing technologies means that MOI 
      can be detected genome wide by considering the abundance of heterozygous
      genotypes. Here, we present a method to estimate MOI, which considers unique
      combinations of polymorphisms from sequence reads. The method is implemented
      within the estMOI software. When applied to clinical P.falciparum isolates from
      three continents, we find that multiple infections are common, especially in
      regions with high transmission.

PG  - CD010927
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Artemisinin-based
      Combination Therapy (ACT) for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria. This review aims to assist the decision-making of malaria control
      programmes by providing an overview of the relative effects of
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) versus other recommended ACTs. OBJECTIVES:
      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DHA-P compared to other ACTs for
      treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adults and children. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register;
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The
      Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS, and the metaRegister of Controlled
      Trials (mRCT) up to July 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials
      comparing a three-day course of DHA-P to a three-day course of an alternative WHO
      recommended ACT in uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of
      bias, and extracted data. We analysed primary outcomes in line with the WHO
      'Protocol for assessing and monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy' and compared
      drugs using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary
      outcomes were effects on gametocytes, haemoglobin, and adverse events. We
      assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We
      included 27 trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children, and conducted between
      2002 and 2010. Most trials excluded infants aged less than six months and
      pregnant women. DHA-P versus artemether-lumefantrineIn Africa, over 28 days
      follow-up, DHA-P is superior to artemether-lumefantrine at preventing further
      parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.39,
      nine trials, 6200 participants, high quality evidence), and although PCR-adjusted
      treatment failure was below 5% for both ACTs, it was consistently lower with
      DHA-P (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62, nine trials,
      5417 participants, high quality evidence). DHA-P has a longer prophylactic effect
      on new infections which may last for up to 63 days (PCR-unadjusted treatment
      failure: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78, two trials, 3200 participants, high
      quality evidence).In Asia and Oceania, no differences have been shown at day 28
      (four trials, 1143 participants, moderate quality evidence), or day 63 (one
      trial, 323 participants, low quality evidence).Compared to
      artemether-lumefantrine, no difference was seen in prolonged QTc (low quality
      evidence), and no cardiac arrhythmias were reported. The frequency of other
      adverse events is probably similar with both combinations (moderate quality
      evidence). DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquineIn Asia, over 28 days
      follow-up, DHA-P is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at preventing
      further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: eight trials, 3487
      participants, high quality evidence). Once adjusted by PCR to exclude new
      infections, treatment failure at day 28 was below 5% for both ACTs in all eight
      trials, but lower with DHA-P in two trials (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR
      0.41 95% CI 0.21 to 0.80, eight trials, 3482 participants, high quality
      evidence). Both combinations contain partner drugs with very long half-lives and 
      no consistent benefit in preventing new infections has been seen over 63 days
      follow-up (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: five trials, 2715 participants,
      moderate quality evidence).In the only trial from South America, there were fewer
      recurrent parastaemias over 63 days with artesunate plus mefloquine
      (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.40 to 27.35, one trial, 445 
      participants, low quality evidence), but no differences were seen once adjusted
      for new infections (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: one trial, 435 participants, 
      low quality evidence).DHA-P is associated with less nausea, vomiting, dizziness, 
      sleeplessness, and palpitations compared to artesunate plus mefloquine (moderate 
      quality evidence). DHA-P was associated with more frequent prolongation of the
      QTc interval (low quality evidence), but no cardiac arrhythmias were reported.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In Africa, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine reduces overall
      treatment failure compared to artemether-lumefantrine, although both drugs have
      PCR-adjusted failure rates of less than 5%. In Asia,
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine, and
      is better tolerated.

TI  - Spatial distribution of the sibling species of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato
      (Diptera: Culicidae) and malaria prevalence in Bayelsa State, Nigeria.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much of the confusing ecophenotypic plasticity of Anopheles gambiae
      sensu lato is attributable to the differential biological traits of the sibling
      species, with their heterogeneous geographical distribution, behavioral
      dissimilarities and divergent population dynamics. These differences are critical
      to their roles in malaria transmission. Studies were, therefore, undertaken on
      the spatial distribution of these species and malaria prevalence rates in Bayelsa
      State, September, 2008-August 2010. METHODS: Mosquito sampling was in 7
      towns/villages in 7 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 3 eco-vegetational zones:
      Fresh Water Swamp Forest (FWSF): Sagbama, Yenagoa, Kolokuma-Opokuma LGAs;
      Brackish Water Swamp Forest (BWSF): Ogbia, Ekeremor, Southern Ijaw LGAs; Mangrove
      Water Forest (MWF): Nembe LGA. Adults were collected twice quarterly by the
      Pyrethrum Spray Catch (PSC) technique. Anopheles was separated morphologically
      and the sibling species PCR- identified. Simultaneously, malaria prevalence rates
      were calculated from data obtained by the examination of blood smears from
      consenting individuals at hospitals/clinics. RESULTS: An. gambiae s.s. was
      dominant across the 3-eco-vegetational zones. Spatial distribution analyses by
      cell count and nearest neighbor techniques indicated a tendency to clustering of 
      species. An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis clustered in Ekeremor LGA while
      these 2 species and An. melas aggregated in Nembe. The gonotrophic
      (physiological) status examination revealed that 34.3, 23.5, 23.1 and 18.4% of
      the population were fed, unfed, gravid and half gravid respectively. The highest 
      malaria prevalence rates were obtained at Kolokuma-Opokuma and Nembe LGAs.
      Variation in prevalence rates among LGAs was significant (t = 5.976, df = 6,
      p-value = 0.002, p < 0.05). The highest prevalence rate was in the age group,
      30-39 yrs, while the lowest prevalence was in the 0-9 yrs group. CONCLUSION: High
      malaria prevalence rates were associated with An. gambiae s.s. either in
      allopatry or sympatry across eco-vegetational zones. In areas where the sibling
      species clustered, they probably formed nidi for transmission. Socio-economic
      conditions might have contributed to reduced prevalence in Yenagoa, State
      Capital.

AB  - Although microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears remains the gold 
      standard for the diagnosis of malaria, molecular detection using PCR is becoming 
      increasingly popular. Due to discrepant PCR and microscopy results, we aimed to
      optimize our detection assays for Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale by
      sequencing the 18S rRNA region and developing a new primer and probe set for
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Clinical specimens positive for P. malariae (n
      = 15) or P. ovale (n = 33) underwent amplification and sequencing of the 18S rRNA
      region. Based on sequence discrepancies between our current primer/probe and
      clinical isolates, degenerate P. ovale primer and probe were developed to
      determine if their performance characteristics improved. The reference (gold)
      standard was microscopy. No 18S sequence heterogeneity was observed among the P. 
      malariae isolates, and the sensitivity and specificity of our current P. malariae
      qPCR assay were both 100%. Compared to microscopy, the sensitivity and
      specificity of our current P. ovale qPCR assay were 72.7% and 100%, respectively.
      Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in P. ovale. The
      sensitivity of the new P. ovale assay increased to 100% with 100% specificity. We
      therefore improved the performance characteristics of our P. ovale molecular
      detection assay through the development of a degenerate primer and probe set
      which accommodates 18S SNPs among the 2 subspecies of P. ovale. Given the
      suboptimal sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests for non-falciparum malaria and
      the typically low parasitemia of P. malariae and P. ovale, a well-performing
      confirmatory molecular assay is imperative for clinical laboratories.

      tests in hospitalized children in a seasonal hyperendemic malaria transmission
      area in Burkina Faso.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most sub-Saharan African countries malaria rapid diagnostic tests 
      (RDTs) are now used for the diagnosis of malaria. Most RDTs used detect
      Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2), though P.
      falciparum-specific parasite lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH)-detecting RDTs may
      have advantages over PfHRP2-detecting RDTs. Only few data are available on the
      use of RDTs in severe illness and the present study compared Pf-pLDH to
      PfHRP2-detection. METHODS: Hospitalized children aged one month to 14 years
      presenting with fever or severe illness were included over one year. Venous blood
      samples were drawn for malaria diagnosis (microscopy and RDT), culture and
      complete blood count. Leftovers were stored at -80 degrees C and used for
      additional RDT analysis and PCR. An RDT targeting both PfHRP2 and Pf-pLDH was
      performed on all samples for direct comparison of diagnostic accuracy with
      microscopy as reference method. PCR was performed to explore false-positive RDT
      results. RESULTS: In 376 of 694 (54.2%) included children, malaria was
      microscopically confirmed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
      (PPV) and negative predictive value were 100.0, 70.9, 69.4 and 100.0%,
      respectively for PfHRP2-detection and 98.7, 94.0, 91.6 and 99.1%, respectively
      for Pf-pLDH-detection. Specificity and PPV were significantly lower for
      PfHRP2-detection (p <0.001). For both detection antigens, specificity was lowest 
      for children one to five years and in the rainy season. PPV for both antigens was
      highest in the rainy season, because of higher malaria prevalence. False positive
      PfHRP2 results were associated with prior anti-malarial treatment and positive
      PCR results (98/114 (86.0%) samples tested). CONCLUSION: Among children
      presenting with severe febrile illness in a seasonal hyperendemic malaria
      transmission area, the present study observed similar sensitivity but lower
      specificity and PPV of PfHRP2 compared to Pf-pLDH-detection. Further studies
      should assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of an appropriate
      Pf-pLDH-detecting RDT in field settings and if satisfying, replacement of PfHRP2 
      by Pf-pLDH-detecting RDTs should be considered.

AB  - Given that the evolution and spread of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP) have been documented at a quick pace worldwide, the present study
      investigated the mutant Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
      108-asparagine (dhfr 108 N) as a key marker of resistance to the combination
      among parasite isolates from Hodeidah. The association of parasitologic indices
      with the dhfr 108 N mutant allele was also studied. Ninety patients with
      microscopically confirmed P. falciparum infection from Hodeidah were included in 
      the present study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
      polymorphism approach was adopted for the molecular detection of this marker. The
      dhfr 108 N was detected among about 61% of P. falciparum isolates, in its pure
      and mixed-type forms, from Hodeidah. Age, gender and residence of patients were
      not significant predictors for the presence of the mutant allele among parasite
      isolates. In contrast, a history of malaria and antimalarial drug intake in the
      year preceding the study as well as frequent antimalarial drug intake were
      significantly associated with this mutant allele. The high frequency of dhfr 108 
      N among parasites isolates makes the role of SP questionable as a partner with
      outstanding effectiveness within the ACT, at least, in the near future. SP plus
      artesunate should be monitored for its antimalarial efficacy at regular
      intervals, preferably through the molecular detection of resistance-associated
      mutations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO has reported that RDT and microscopy-confirmed malaria cases 
      have declined in recent years. However, it is still unclear if this reflects a
      real decrease in incidence in Bangladesh, as particularly the hilly and forested 
      areas of the Chittagong Hill Tract (CHT) Districts report more than 80% of all
      cases and deaths. surveillance and epidemiological data on malaria from the CHT
      are limited; existing data report Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax as
      the dominant species. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the
      District of Bandarban, the southernmost of the three Hill Tracts Districts, to
      collect district-wide malaria prevalence data from one of the regions with the
      highest malaria endemicity in Bangladesh. A multistage cluster sampling technique
      was used to collect blood samples from febrile and afebrile participants and
      malaria microscopy and standardized nested PCR for diagnosis were performed.
      Demographic data, vital signs and splenomegaly were recorded. RESULTS: Malaria
      prevalence across all subdistricts in the monsoon season was 30.7% (95% CI:
      28.3-33.2) and 14.2% (95% CI: 12.5-16.2) by PCR and microscopy, respectively.
      Plasmodium falciparum mono-infections accounted for 58.9%, P. vivax
      mono-infections for 13.6%, Plasmodium malariae for 1.8%, and Plasmodium ovale for
      1.4% of all positive cases. In 24.4% of all cases mixed infections were
      identified by PCR. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among PCR-confirmed 
      cases was 77.0%, oligosymptomatic and symptomatic cases accounted for only 19.8
      and 3.2%, respectively. Significantly (p < 0.01) more asymptomatic cases were
      recorded among participants older than 15 years as compared to younger
      participants, whereas prevalence and parasite density were significantly (p <
      0.01) higher in patients younger than 15 years. Spleen rate and malaria
      prevalence in two to nine year olds were 18.6 and 34.6%, respectively. No
      significant difference in malaria prevalence and parasite density was observed
      between dry and rainy season. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of asymptomatic
      plasmodial infections was found which likely act as a reservoir of transmission. 
      This has major implications for ongoing malaria control programmes that are based
      on the treatment of symptomatic patients. These findings highlight the need for
      new intervention strategies targeting asymptomatic carriers.

TI  - Natural antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens MSP5, MSP9 
      and EBA175 is associated to clinical protection in the Brazilian Amazon.
PG  - 608
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-13-608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibodies have an essential role in the acquired immune response
      against blood stage P. falciparum infection. Although several antigens have been 
      identified as important antibody targets, it is still elusive which antigens have
      to be recognized for clinical protection. Herein, we analyzed antibodies from
      plasmas from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals living in the same
      geographic area in the Western Amazon, measuring their recognition of multiple
      merozoite antigens. METHODS: Specific fragments of genes encoding merozoite
      proteins AMA1 and members of MSP and EBL families from circulating P. falciparum 
      field isolates present in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were amplified by
      PCR. After cloning and expression of different versions of the antigens as
      recombinant GST-fusion peptides, we tested the reactivity of patients' plasmas by
      ELISA and the presence of IgG subclasses in the most reactive plasmas. RESULTS:
      11 out of 24 recombinant antigens were recognized by plasmas from either
      symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. Antibodies to MSP9 (X2(DF=1) = 9.26/p =
      0.0047) and MSP5 (X2(DF=1) = 8.29/p = 0.0069) were more prevalent in asymptomatic
      individuals whereas the opposite was observed for MSP1 block 2-MAD20 (X2(DF=1) = 
      6.41/p = 0.0206, Fisher's exact test). Plasmas from asymptomatic individuals
      reacted more intensely against MSP4 (U = 210.5, p < 0.03), MSP5 (U = 212, p <
      0.004), MSP9 (U = 189.5, p < 0.002) and EBA175 (U = 197, p < 0.014,
      Mann-Whitney's U test). IgG1 and IgG3 were predominant for all antigens, but some
      patients also presented with IgG2 and IgG4. The recognition of MSP5 (OR = 0.112, 
      IC95% = 0.021-0.585) and MSP9 (OR = 0.125, IC95% = 0.030-0.529, cross tab
      analysis) predicted 8.9 and 8 times less chances, respectively, to present
      symptoms. Higher antibody levels against MSP5 and EBA175 were associated by odds 
      ratios of 9.4 (IC95% = 1.29-69.25) and 5.7 (IC95% = 1.12-29.62, logistic
      regression), respectively, with an asymptomatic status. CONCLUSIONS: Merozoite
      antigens were targets of cytophilic antibodies and antibodies against MSP5, MSP9 
      and EBA175 were independently associated with decreased symptoms.

TI  - Structural polymorphism in the promoter of pfmrp2 confers Plasmodium falciparum
      tolerance to quinoline drugs.
PG  - 918-34
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12505 [doi]
AB  - Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum remains a challenge for the malaria
      eradication programmes around the world. With the emergence of artemisinin
      resistance, the efficacy of the partner drugs in the artemisinin combination
      therapies (ACT) that include quinoline-based drugs is becoming critical. So far
      only few resistance markers have been identified from which only two
      transmembrane transporters namely PfMDR1 (an ATP-binding cassette transporter)
      and PfCRT (a drug-metabolite transporter) have been experimentally verified.
      Another P. falciparum transporter, the ATP-binding cassette containing multidrug 
      resistance-associated protein (PfMRP2) represents an additional possible factor
      of drug resistance in P. falciparum. In this study, we identified a parasite
      clone that is derived from the 3D7 P. falciparum strain and shows increased
      resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine through the trophozoite and
      schizont stages. We demonstrate that the resistance phenotype is caused by a 4.1 
      kb deletion in the 5' upstream region of the pfmrp2 gene that leads to an
      alteration in the pfmrp2 transcription and thus increased level of PfMRP2
      protein. These results also suggest the importance of putative promoter elements 
      in regulation of gene expression during the P. falciparum intra-erythrocytic
      developmental cycle and the potential of genetic polymorphisms within these
      regions to underlie drug resistance.

AB  - This study compares the performance of clinical diagnosis and three laboratory
      diagnostic methods (thick film microscopy (TFM), rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum in
      Nigeria. Using clinical criteria, 217 children were recruited into the study out 
      of which 106 (48.8%) were positive by TFM, 84 (38.7%) by RDT, and 125 (57.6%) by 
      PCR. Using a composite reference method generated from the three diagnostic
      methods, 71 (32.7%) patients were found to be truly infected and 90 (41.5%) truly
      uninfected, while 56 (25.8%) were misidentified as infected or noninfected. When 
      each of the 3 diagnostic methods was compared with the composite reference, PCR
      had sensitivity of 97.3%, specificity of 62.5%, positive predictive value (PPV)
      of 56.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.8%; microscopy had
      sensitivity of 77.2%, specificity of 72%, PPV of 66.9%, and NPV of 81.1%, while
      RDT had sensitivity of 62.3%, specificity of 87.4%, PPV of 67.7%, and NPV of
      84.5%. PCR test performed best among the three methods followed by TFM and RDT in
      that order. The result of this study shows that clinical diagnosis cannot be
      relied upon for accurate diagnosis of P. falciparum in endemic areas.

TI  - Assessment of pfcrt 72-76 haplotypes eight years after chloroquine withdrawal in 
      Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.
PG  - 459
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use 
      of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria cases, as monotherapies had become ineffective in many
      parts of the world. As a result, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) withdrew 
      chloroquine (CQ) from its malaria treatment policy in 2002 and an artesunate
      (AS)-amodiaquine (AQ) combination became the ACT of choice in DRC in 2005.
      AQ-resistance (AQR) has been reported in several parts of the world and mutations
      in codons 72-76 of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter
      (pfcrt) gene have been strongly correlated with resistance, especially mutations 
      encoding the SVMNT haplotype. This haplotype was first identified in Southeast
      Asia and South America but was recently reported in two African countries
      neighbouring DRC. These facts raised two questions: the first about the evolution
      of CQ resistance (CQR) in DRC and the second about the presence of the SVMNT
      haplotype, which would compromise the use of AQ as a partner drug for ACT.
      METHODS: A total of 213 thick blood films were randomly collected in 2010 from a 
      paediatric clinic in Kinshasa, DRC. Microscopy controls and real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed for Plasmodium species identification.
      Haplotypes of the pfcrt gene were determined by sequencing. RESULTS: The K76T
      mutation was detected in 145 out of 198 P. falciparum-positive samples (73.2%).
      In these 145 resistant strains, only the CVIET haplotype was detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to assess the molecular markers of
      resistance to CQ and AQ after the introduction of ACT in DRC. The results suggest
      first that CQR is decreasing, as wild-type pfcrt haplotypes were found in only
      26.8% of the samples and secondly that the SVMNT haplotype is not yet present in 
      Kinshasa, suggesting that AQ remains valid as a partner drug for ACT in this
      region.

PG  - 402-4, 407
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of the K76T mutation in Pfcrt genes of
      imported Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: The blood samples were collected from
      returnees infected with P. falciparum in endemic areas of Southeast Asia and
      Africa from 2008 to 2012. According to the Pfcrt gene sequence of P. falciparum, 
      nested PCR primers were designed. Nested PCR-RFLP was applied with falciparum DNA
      in the blood samples as templates. RESULTS: Among 92 blood samples of P.
      falciparum, the mutant Pfcrt alleles were found in 50 samples (54.3%), and the
      wild type Pfcrt alleles were found in 42 samples (45.7%). There were 33 samples
      (47.1%) with mutant Pfcrt alleles and 37 samples (52.9%) with wild type,
      respectively, from Africa. There were 17 samples (77.3%) with mutant Pfcrt
      alleles and 5 samples (22.7%) with wild type, respectively, from Southeast Asia. 
      There was a significant difference between the Africa group and the Southeast
      Asia group (Chi(2) = 6.12, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The incidence of Pfcrt gene
      mutation is different among P. falciparum isolates from different regions.
      Therefore, Pfcrt K76T has an application value in the surveillance of the
      imported falciparum chloroquine-resistance.

TI  - Selection for chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum by wild Anopheles
      arabiensis in Southern Zambia.
PG  - 453
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-453 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of parasite drug resistance, especially Plasmodium
      falciparum, persists as a major obstacle for malaria control and elimination. To 
      develop effective public health containment strategies, a clear understanding of 
      factors that govern the emergence and spread of resistant parasites in the field 
      is important. The current study documents selection for chloroquine-sensitive
      malaria parasites by wild Anopheles arabiensis in southern Zambia. METHODS: In a 
      2,000-sq km region, mosquitoes were collected from human sleeping rooms using
      pyrethrum spray catches during the 2006 malaria transmission season. After
      morphological examination and molecular confirmation, vector mosquitoes were
      dissected to separate head and thorax from the abdominal section, followed by PCR
      screening for P. falciparum infection. Human residents of all ages were tested
      for P. falciparum parasitaemia by microscopy and PCR. Plasmodium falciparum
      infections were genotyped at the chloroquine resistance-conferring amino acid
      codon 76 of the PfCRT gene, using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: 
      In the human population there was nearly 90% prevalence of the
      chloroquine-resistant PfCRT K76T mutant, with no significant differences in
      polymorphism among smear-positive and smear-negative (submicroscopic) infections 
      (p = 0.323, n = 128). However, infections in both abdominal and salivary gland
      phases of the An. arabiensis vector exhibited wild type K76-bearing parasites
      with up to 9X higher odds (OR (95% CI): 9 (3.7-20.2), p < 0.0005, n = 125),
      despite having been acquired from humans within a few weeks. CONCLUSIONS:
      Anopheles arabiensis selects for wild-type K76-bearing P. falciparum during both 
      abdominal and salivary gland phases of parasite development. The rapid vectorial 
      selection, also recently seen with antifolate resistance, is evidence for
      parasite fitness cost in the mosquito, and may underpin regional heterogeneity in
      the emergence, spread and waning of drug resistance. Understanding the nature and
      direction of vector selection could be instrumental for rational curtailment of
      the spread of drug resistance in integrated malaria control and elimination
      programmes.

TI  - Monitoring the efficacy and safety of three artemisinin based-combinations
      therapies in Senegal: results from two years surveillance.
PG  - 598
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-13-598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem in developing
      countries. Then in these countries prompt access to effective antimalarial
      treatment such as Artemisinin based-Combination Therapies (ACT) proves to be an
      essential tool for controlling the disease. In Senegal, since 2006 a nationwide
      scaling up program of ACT is being implemented. In this context it has become
      relevant to monitor ACT efficacy and provide recommendations for the Senegalese
      national malaria control program. METHODS: An open randomized trial was conducted
      during two malaria transmission seasons (2011 and 2012) to assess the efficacy
      and safety of three combinations: dihydro-artemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ),
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ). The primary end
      point of the study was represented by a PCR adjusted adequate clinical and
      parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28. Secondary end points included: (i) a
      ACPR at days 35 and 42, (ii) a parasite and fever clearance time, (iii) ACTs
      safety and tolerability. The 2003 WHO's protocol for antimalarial drug evaluation
      was used to assess each outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 534 patients were randomized
      selected to receive, either ASAQ (n = 180), AL (n = 178) or DHAPQ (n = 176). The 
      PCR adjusted ACPR at day 28 was 99.41% for the group ASAQ, while that was 100% in
      the AL and DHAPQ groups (p = 0.37). The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated at
      99.37% in the ASAQ arm versus 100% in AL and DHAPQ arm at day 35 (p = 0.37). At
      day 42, the ACPR was 99.27% in the ASAQ group versus 100% for both AL and DHAPQ
      groups, (p = 0.36). No serious adverse event was noted during the study period.
      Also a similar safety profile was noted in the 3 study groups. CONCLUSION: In the
      context of scaling up of ACTs in Senegal, ASAQ, AL and DHAPQ are highly effective
      and safe antimalarial drugs. However, it's remains important to continue to
      monitor their efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PACTR 201305000552290.

AB  - In the current era of malaria eradication, reducing transmission is critical.
      Assessment of transmissibility requires tools that can accurately identify the
      various developmental stages of the malaria parasite, particularly those required
      for transmission (sexual stages). Here, we present a method for estimating
      relative amounts of Plasmodium falciparum asexual and sexual stages from gene
      expression measurements. These are modeled using constrained linear regression to
      characterize stage-specific expression profiles within mixed-stage populations.
      The resulting profiles were analyzed functionally by gene set enrichment analysis
      (GSEA), confirming differentially active pathways such as increased mitochondrial
      activity and lipid metabolism during sexual development. We validated model
      predictions both from microarrays and from quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
      measurements, based on the expression of a small set of key transcriptional
      markers. This sufficient marker set was identified by backward selection from the
      whole genome as available from expression arrays, targeting one sentinel marker
      per stage. The model as learned can be applied to any new microarray or qRT-PCR
      transcriptional measurement. We illustrate its use in vitro in inferring changes 
      in stage distribution following stress and drug treatment and in vivo in
      identifying immature and mature sexual stage carriers within patient cohorts. We 
      believe this approach will be a valuable resource for staging lab and field
      samples alike and will have wide applicability in epidemiological studies of
      malaria transmission.

AB  - Malaria is wide spread in poor world and its burden has been assessed by the
      enumeration of malarial parasites in blood of patients. This study was designed
      to find a relationship between social structure, and spread of malaria in Khyber 
      agency. The average parasite density was 2050 parasite/mul in Khyber Agency. Due 
      to economic and social setup most of the people have habit of sleeping in open
      air thus playing role in high malaria prevalence and Plasmodium vivax remains the
      prevalent species. Genetic study performed on 110 Blood samples showed less
      genetic diversity for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. Eight
      alleles were distinguished both for Pvmsp 3alpha and Pvmsp 3beta in total of 20
      and 39 amplified samples of P. vivax respectively. Out of 17 samples amplified
      for P. falciparum 11 showed genotype K1 and 10 for MAD at Pfmsp-1 while 14
      alleles were identified for 3D7/1C and two for FC27 of corresponding families of 
      Pfmsp-2 gene. This shows that Plasmodium parasites are not genetically diverse in
      Khyber agency.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum immature gametocytes are not observed in peripheral blood. 
      However, gametocyte stages in organs such as bone marrow have never been assessed
      by molecular techniques, which are more sensitive than optical microscopy. We
      quantified P falciparum sexual stages in bone marrow (n = 174) and peripheral
      blood (n = 70) of Mozambican anemic children by quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction targeting transcripts specific for early (PF14_0748; PHISTa),
      intermediate (PF13_0247; Pfs48/45), and mature (PF10_0303; Pfs25) gametocytes.
      Among children positive for the P falciparum housekeeping gene (PF08_0085;
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene) in bone marrow (n = 136) and peripheral blood 
      (n = 25), prevalence of immature gametocytes was higher in bone marrow than
      peripheral blood (early: 95% vs 20%, P < .001; intermediate: 80% vs 16%; P <
      .001), as were transcript levels (P < .001 for both stages). In contrast, mature 
      gametocytes were more prevalent (100% vs 51%, P < .001) and abundant (P < .001)
      in peripheral blood than in the bone marrow. Severe anemia (3.57, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.49-8.53) and dyserythropoiesis (6.21, 95% confidence interval
      2.24-17.25) were independently associated with a higher prevalence of mature
      gametocytes in bone marrow. Our results highlight the high prevalence and
      abundance of early sexual stages in bone marrow, as well as the relationship
      between hematological disturbances and gametocyte development in this tissue.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to
      most commonly used antimalarials remain a major challenge in the control of
      malaria. Constant monitoring of drug efficacy is an important tool in
      establishing rational antimalarial drug policies. METHODOLOGY: A randomized
      comparative study was conducted at the Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa, Nigeria
      between February 2010 and September 2011 comparing the efficacy and safety of
      artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and fixed dose of artesunate plus amodiaquine
      (Larimal) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children
      betweem 6 and 144 months of age. P. falciparum malaria parasitemia was assessed
      by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test. Drugs were administered according to age
      for three days under supervision. The primary efficacy endpoint was a day 28
      PCR-corrected parasitological cure. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were
      enrolled in the two treatment groups, Coartem (n = 101) and Larimal (n = 81), and
      tested after 28 days. In the intention-to-treat population, Coartem (n = 101) and
      Larimal (n = 81) had a PCR-corrected cure rate of 98% and 100% respectively,
      while in the per-protocol population, Coartem (n = 89) and Larimal (n = 71) both 
      had a PCR-corrected cure rate of 100% at day 28. Although parasite and fever
      clearance time was faster in the Larimal group, no significant difference was
      observed between the two drugs. No serious adverse effects were reported.
      CONCLUSION: Five years after being introduced in Nigeria, both Coartem and
      Larimal have been shown to be safe and highly effective in the treatment of
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children.

PG  - 445
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SDX/PYR) combination had been chosen 
      to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Malaysia for more than 30 years.
      Non-silent mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
      synthase (dhps) genes are responsible for the resistance to pyrimethamine and
      sulphadoxine, respectively. This study reports the mutational analysis of pfdhfr 
      and pfdhps in single Plasmodium falciparum infection isolates from the interior
      division of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. METHODS: A total of 22 P. falciparum single 
      infection isolates collected from two districts of the interior division of Sabah
      from February to November 2010 were recruited for the mutational study of pfdhfr 
      and pfdhps. Both genes were amplified by nested PCR prior to DNA sequencing and
      mutational analysis. RESULTS: A total of three pfdhfr and four pfdhps alleles
      were identified. The most prevalent pfdhfr allele is ANRNL (86%) involving triple
      mutation at position 108(S to N), 59(C to R) and 164(I to L). In pfdhps, two
      novel alleles, SGTGA (73%) and AAKAA (5%) were identified. Alleles involving
      triple mutation in both pfdhfr (ANRNL) and pfdhps (SGTGA), which were absent in
      Sabah in a study conducted about 15 years ago, are now prevalent. CONCLUSIONS:
      High prevalence of mutations in SDX/PYR associated drug resistance genes are
      reported in this study. This mutational study of pfdhps and pfdhfr indicating
      that SDX/PYR should be discontinued in this region.

TI  - Strategies for detection of Plasmodium species gametocytes.
PG  - e76316
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0076316 [doi]
AB  - Carriage and density of gametocytes, the transmission stages of malaria
      parasites, are determined for predicting the infectiousness of humans to
      mosquitoes. This measure is used for evaluating interventions that aim at
      reducing malaria transmission. Gametocytes need to be detected by amplification
      of stage-specific transcripts, which requires RNA-preserving blood sampling. For 
      simultaneous, highly sensitive quantification of both, blood stages and
      gametocytes, we have compared and optimized different strategies for field and
      laboratory procedures in a cross sectional survey in 315 5-9 yr old children from
      Papua New Guinea. qRT-PCR was performed for gametocyte markers pfs25 and pvs25,
      Plasmodium species prevalence was determined by targeting both, 18S rRNA genes
      and transcripts. RNA-based parasite detection resulted in a P. falciparum
      positivity of 24.1%; of these 40.8% carried gametocytes. P. vivax positivity was 
      38.4%, with 38.0% of these carrying gametocytes. Sensitivity of DNA-based
      parasite detection was substantially lower with 14.1% for P. falciparum and 19.6%
      for P. vivax. Using the lower DNA-based prevalence of asexual stages as a
      denominator increased the percentage of gametocyte-positive infections to 59.1%
      for P. falciparum and 52.4% for P. vivax. For studies requiring highly sensitive 
      and simultaneous quantification of sexual and asexual parasite stages, 18S rRNA
      transcript-based detection saves efforts and costs. RNA-based positivity is
      considerably higher than other methods. On the other hand, DNA-based parasite
      quantification is robust and permits comparison with other globally generated
      molecular prevalence data. Molecular monitoring of low density asexual and sexual
      parasitaemia will support the evaluation of effects of up-scaled antimalarial
      intervention programs and can also inform about small scale spatial variability
      in transmission intensity.

TI  - A case report of transfusion-transmitted Plasmodium malariae from an asymptomatic
      non-immune traveller.
PG  - 439
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-439 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of transfusion-transmitted malaria is very low in
      non-endemic countries due to strict donor selection. The optimal strategy to
      mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria in non-endemic countries
      without unnecessary exclusion of blood donations is, however, still debated and
      asymptomatic carriers of Plasmodium species may still be qualified to donate
      blood for transfusion purposes. CASE DESCRIPTION: In April 2011, a 59-year-old
      Dutch woman with spiking fevers for four days was diagnosed with a Plasmodium
      malariae infection. The patient had never been abroad, but nine weeks before, she
      had received red blood cell transfusion for anaemia. The presumptive diagnosis of
      transfusion-transmitted quartan malaria was made and subsequently confirmed by
      retrospective PCR analysis of donor blood samples. The donor was a 36-year-old
      Dutch male who started donating blood in May 2006. His travel history outside
      Europe included a trip to Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar in 2005, to Thailand in
      2006 and to Costa Rica in 2007. He only used malaria prophylaxis during his
      travel to Africa. The donor did not show any abnormalities upon physical
      examination in 2011, while laboratory examination demonstrated a thrombocytopenia
      of 126 x 109/L as the sole abnormal finding since 2007. Thick blood smear
      analysis and the Plasmodium PCR confirmed an ongoing subclinical P. malariae
      infection. Chloroquine therapy was started, after which the infection cleared and
      thrombocyte count normalized. Fourteen other recipients who received red blood
      cells from the involved donor were traced. None of them developed malaria
      symptoms. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that P. malariae infections in
      non-immune travellers may occur without symptoms and persist subclinically for
      years. In addition, this case shows that these infections pose a threat to
      transfusion safety when subclinically infected persons donate blood after their
      return in a non-endemic malaria region.Since thrombocytopenia was the only
      abnormality associated with the subclinical malaria infection in the donor, this 
      case illustrates that an unexplained low platelet count after a visit to
      malaria-endemic countries may be an indicator for asymptomatic malaria even when 
      caused by non-falciparum Plasmodium species.

PG  - 3418
LID - 10.1038/srep03418 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito feeding assays are important in evaluations of malaria
      transmission-reducing interventions. The proportion of mosquitoes with midgut
      oocysts is commonly used as an outcome measure, but in natural low intensity
      infections the effect of oocyst non-rupture on mosquito infectivity is unclear.
      By identifying ruptured as well as intact oocysts, we show that in low intensity 
      P. falciparum infections i) 66.7-96.7% of infected mosquitoes experienced oocyst 
      rupture between 11-21 days post-infection, ii) oocyst rupture led invariably to
      sporozoite release, iii) oocyst rupture led to salivary gland infections in 97.8%
      of mosquitoes, and iv) 1250 (IQR 313-2400) salivary gland sporozoites were found 
      per ruptured oocyst. These data show that infectivity can be predicted with
      reasonable certainty from oocyst prevalence in low intensity infections. High
      throughput methods for detecting infection in whole mosquitoes showed that 18s
      PCR but not circumsporozoite ELISA gave a reliable approximation of mosquito
      infection rates on day 7 post-infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To detect malarial parasites using the peripheral blood smear (PBS)
      and to compare the PBS with the immunochromatographic antigen test (i.e. OptiMAL 
      and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). METHODS: Six ml of blood was collected from
      each of 170 patients clinically suspected of having malaria. These samples were
      used to perform PBS examination, the OptiMAL test and PCR by standard protocol.
      RESULTS: PBS examination found malarial parasites in 86 (50.6%) samples. In
      comparison, 71 (41.8%) samples were positive by OptiMAL test whereas PCR could
      detect malarial parasites in only 44 (25.9%) samples. All 84 (49.4%) samples
      which were negative by PBS were negative by both OptiMAL and PCR. The sensitivity
      and specificity were respectively 85.54% and 100% for OptiMAL and 51.12% and 100%
      for PCR. CONCLUSION; Depending on the tests' operational feasibility, and the
      availability of adequate trained personnel, equipment and laboratory management
      systems, and considering its sensitivity and cost-effectiveness, peripheral blood
      smear remains the test of choice for malaria, especially in endemic areas.

AB  - Amongst host genetic factors, cytokine gene polymorphism can be anticipated to be
      an important factor as qualitative, quantitative and time of secretion play an
      important role in disease outcome. We have investigated association of cytokine
      promoter SNPs with risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and disease severity in 
      a case control study in malaria endemic Karbi Anglong district of Assam, India.
      Frequency of IL-8-251T/A (p=0.03 and p=0.01) and TGF-beta1-509C/T (p=0.02 and
      p=0.03) was higher in malaria in comparison to control participants and
      non-malarial fever controls. Interestingly, a higher frequency of mutant allele
      of IL-10-819T/C was observed in non-malarial fever controls compared to malaria
      thus suggesting its role as a distinguishing marker of the two disease groups.
      Higher IL-8 expression and increased frequency of IL-8-251T/A in complicated
      malaria (p=0.002) was reported indicating its role in susceptibility to
      complicated malaria. In conclusion, our study suggests the role of mutant
      genotype of IL-8-251T/A as a marker of complicated malaria in our population.
      Surprisingly, decreased expression of TGF-beta1 in uncomplicated malaria even in 
      presence of high expressing mutant genotype was observed and needs to be
      investigated in context of the pool of activated cells producing the cytokine.

PG  - 1136-43
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit613 [doi]
AB  - In malaria holoendemic settings, decreased parasitemia and clinical disease is
      associated with age and cumulative exposure. The relative contribution of
      acquired immunity against various stages of the parasite life cycle is not well
      understood. In particular, it is not known whether changes in infection dynamics 
      can be best explained by decreasing rates of infection, or by decreased growth
      rates of parasites in blood. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection after treatment in a cohort of 197 healthy study
      participants of different ages. We use both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      microscopy detection of parasitemia in order to understand parasite growth rates 
      and infection rates over time. The more sensitive PCR assay detects parasites
      earlier than microscopy, and demonstrates a higher overall prevalence of
      infection than microscopy alone. The delay between PCR and microscopy detection
      is significantly longer in adults compared with children, consistent with slower 
      parasite growth with age. We estimated the parasite multiplication rate from
      delay to PCR and microscopy detections of parasitemia. We find that both the
      delay between PCR and microscopy infection as well as the differing reinfection
      dynamics in different age groups are best explained by a slowing of parasite
      growth with age.

TI  - Survey of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance-1 and chloroquine resistance
      transporter alleles in Haiti.
PG  - 426
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Haiti where chloroquine (CQ) is widely used for malaria treatment,
      reports of resistance are scarce. However, recent identification of CQ resistance
      genotypes in one site is suggestive of an emerging problem. Additional studies
      are needed to evaluate genetic mutations associated with CQ resistance,
      especially in the Plasmodium falciparum multi-drug resistance-1 gene (pfmdr1)
      while expanding the already available information on P. falciparum CQ transporter
      gene (pfcrt) in Haiti. METHODS: Blood samples were collected on Whatman filter
      cards (FTA) from eight clinics spread across Haiti. Following the confirmation of
      P. falciparum in the samples, PCR protocols were used to amplify regions of
      pfmdr1and pfcrt codons of interest, (86, 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246) and (72-76), 
      respectively. Sequencing and site-specific restriction enzyme digestions were
      used to analyse these DNA fragments for the presence of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) known to confer resistance to anti-malarial drugs. RESULTS: 
      P. falciparum infection was confirmed in160 samples by amplifying a segment of
      the P. falciparum 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (pfssurrna). The sequence 
      of pfmdr1 in 54 of these samples was determined between codons 86,184 codons
      1034, 1042 and 1246. No sequence differences from that of the NF54 clone 3D7 were
      found among the 54 samples except at codon 184, where a non-silent mutation was
      found in all samples predicted to alter the amino acid sequence replacing
      tyrosine with phenylalanine (Y184F). This altered sequence was also confirmed by 
      restriction enzyme digestion. The sequence of pfmdr1 at codons 86, 184, 1034 and 
      1042 encoded the NFSN haplotype. The sequence of pfcrt codons 72-76 from 79
      samples was determined and found to encode CVMNK, consistent with a CQ sensitive 
      genotype. CONCLUSION: The presence of the Y184F mutation in pfmdr1 of P.
      falciparum parasites in Haiti may have implications for resistance to
      antimalarial drugs. The absence of mutation in pfcrt at codon 76 among 79
      isolates tested suggests that sensitivity to CQ in Haiti remains common.
      Wide-spread screening of the pfmdr1 and pfcrt especially among patients
      experiencing treatment failure may be a useful tool in early detection of the
      emergence of antimalarial drug resistance in Haiti.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a single-round multiplex PCR method for the
      identification of Anopheles minimus complex (An. minimus and Anopheles harrisoni)
      and Anopheles aconitus subgroup (An. aconitus and Anopheles varuna), and for the 
      simultaneous detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in these
      vectors. Five primers were created for a single-round multiplex PCR assay to
      identify four anopheline mosquitoes combined with three Plasmodium primers for
      the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax in vectors. The four species of
      anopheline vectors and two Plasmodium species, P. falciparum and P. vivax, could 
      be identified by the combination of eight primers in the single-round multiplex
      PCR assay. The amplified species-specific products were 380bp for An. minimus,
      180bp for An. harrisoni, 150bp for An. aconitus, 310bp for An. varuna, 276bp for 
      P. falciparum, and 300bp for P. vivax. The sensitivities were 0.5pg/mul
      (25sporozoites/mul) for P. falciparum DNA and between 0.5 and 5pg/mul
      (25-250sporozoites/mul) for P. vivax DNA. Furthermore, this developed method
      could be used to identify field caught An. minimus complex, An. aconitus subgroup
      from Thailand and Lao PDR. Also, it was successfully used to identify the species
      An. minimus, An. harrisoni, An. aconitus and An. varuna and to detect and
      identify P. falciparum and P. vivax in caught anopheline mosquitoes. The
      sensitivity of this method was high for simultaneous detection of P. falciparum
      and P. vivax in anopheline mosquitoes.

TI  - [Evaluation of imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases: the use of
      polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis].
PG  - 668-76
AB  - Malaria affecting almost half of the world population continues to be an
      important health problem. Although domestic malaria cases have been decreasing in
      Turkey recently, cases caused by Plasmodium falciparum have increased due to the 
      frequent travelling to Africa. The aims of this study were to evaluate
      demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings in cases with
      falciparum malaria who attended to our clinic in 2012-2013 period, and the impact
      of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis. Nine patients evaluated were
      all male with a mean age of 34.3 (age range: 18-48) years, with the history of
      travel to Africa. Six cases did not take prophylaxis against malaria and other
      three cases used insufficient time. Mean duration of symptoms after return was
      18.4 (range: 1-75) days, and the patients were admitted to the clinic within a
      mean of 5.2 (range: 1-15) days. Two patients had leucopenia, two patients had
      anemia, and eight patients had thrombocytopenia on admission. Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels in four cases and total bilirubin levels of six
      cases were over upper normal limits. Definitive diagnosis of cases was performed 
      with the detection of ring and/or gametocytes forms of the parasite in
      Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. Furthermore, samples from seven patients 
      were studied by nested PCR by using genus (Plasmodium rPLU 1 and 5) and species
      (rFAL 1 and 2, rVIV 1 and 2, rMAL 1 and 2, rOVA 1 and 2) specific primers. All of
      these seven samples yielded positive results with primers specific for
      P.falciparum ssrRNA. In the treatment, arthemeter/lumefantrin and doxycycline
      combination was used in seven patients, while intravenous artesunate and
      doxycycline combination was given to two patients, resulting with complete cure. 
      Mean duration for the resolving of fever was 3.3 days, and mean duration for
      clearing the parasitemia from peripheral blood was 4.9 days. Initial ALT values
      and the duration of fever resolution (-796; p= 0.010), as well as the duration of
      parasitemia and initial thrombocyte counts (-797; p= 0.010) were negatively-
      correlated. It was concluded that, providing sufficient information on malaria
      and prophylaxis to people travelling to the endemic areas are crutial for
      protection. Moreover, in endemic areas for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,
      patients with fever and thrombocytopenia should be questioned in detail about the
      travel history, and peripheral blood smears should be examined in terms of
      malaria, since their clinical features are similar. Plasmodium PCR should be
      considered as one of the alternative diagnostic method in malaria, especially in 
      cases with inconclusive microscopy.

      Man region, western Cote d'Ivoire.
PG  - 419
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum allows the molecular
      discrimination of otherwise microscopically identical parasites and the
      identification of individual clones in multiple infections. The study reported
      here investigated the P. falciparum multiplicity of infection (MOI) and genetic
      diversity among school-aged children in the Man region, western Cote d'Ivoire.
      METHODS: Blood samples from 292 children aged seven to 15 years were collected in
      four nearby villages located at altitudes ranging from 340 to 883 m above sea
      level. Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films were prepared and examined under
      a microscope for P. falciparum prevalence and parasitaemia. MOI and genetic
      diversity of the parasite populations were investigated using msp2 typing by
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
      RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum prevalence and parasitaemia were both found to be 
      significantly lower in the highest altitude village. Genotyping of the isolates
      revealed 25 potentially new msp2 alleles. MOI varied significantly across
      villages but did not correlate with altitude nor children's age, and only to a
      limited extent with parasitaemia. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
      indicated that a small, but close to statistical significance (p = 0.07),
      fraction of variance occurs specifically between villages of low and high
      altitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher altitude was associated with lower prevalence of
      P. falciparum but not with reduced MOI, suggesting that, in this setting, MOI is 
      not a good proxy for transmission. The evidence for partially parted parasite
      populations suggests the existence of local geographical barriers that should be 
      taken into account when deploying anti-malarial interventions.

TI  - Trends in chloroquine resistance marker, Pfcrt-K76T mutation ten years after
      chloroquine withdrawal in Tanzania.
PG  - 415
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to anti-malarial drugs remains a
      major obstacle to the control of malaria. In 2001 Tanzania replaced chloroquine
      (CQ) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line drug, which in turn was
      replaced by artemisinin combination therapy in 2006. SP has however, continued to
      be used in intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp)
      despite reports of high levels of resistance to SP due to the lack of
      alternatives to SP for IPTp. Recent reports have indicated recovery of
      CQ-susceptibility in Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania based on the
      prevalence of wild types at codon 76 of the Pfcrt gene in indigenous P.
      falciparum populations. The current prevalence of this Pfcrt-76 CQ resistance
      marker from six regions of Tanzania mainland is hereby reported. METHODS: DNA
      extracted from filter-paper dried blood spots and rapid diagnostics kit strips
      collected from finger-prick blood were used to genotype the Pfcrt-76 resistance
      marker using PCR-RFLP. Data from previously published studies were used to
      generate CQ susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression model.
      RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty one (741) samples were genotyped. The current
      frequency of the CQ-susceptible Pfcrt-K76 was above 92% and did not differ
      between regions in Tanzania (chi(2) = 2.37; p = 0.795). The K76 allelic
      prevalence was between 85.7 and 93% in regions (chi(2) = 7.88, p = 0.163). The CQ
      resistance recovery trends showed regional variability that may be caused by
      differences in malaria transmission intensity, but overall the trends converge as
      the susceptibility levels in all regions approach >90%. CONCLUSIONS: CQ
      withdrawal in Tanzania has resulted into >90% recovery of susceptibility in ten
      years of withdrawal. These findings are in support of the search for CQ-based
      combination drugs as a possible future alternative to SP for IPTp in places where
      full recovery of CQ-susceptibility will be evident.

TI  - PftetQ and pfmdt copy numbers as predictive molecular markers of decreased ex
      vivo doxycycline susceptibility in imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 414
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of a
      series of independent doxycycline inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values to
      validate the trimodal distribution previously described and to validate the use
      of the pftetQ and pfmdt genes as molecular markers of decreased in vitro
      doxycycline susceptibility in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. METHODS: Doxycycline
      IC50 values, from 484 isolates obtained at the French National Reference Centre
      for Imported Malaria (Paris) between January 2006 and December 2010, were
      analysed for the first time by a Bayesian mixture modelling approach to
      distinguish the different in vitro phenotypic groups by their IC50 values.
      Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the pftetQ 
      and pfmdt copy numbers of 89 African P. falciparum isolates that were randomly
      chosen from the phenotypic groups. RESULTS: The existence of at least three
      doxycycline phenotypes was demonstrated. The mean doxycycline IC50 was
      significantly higher in the group with a pftetQ copy number >1 compared to the
      group with a pftetQ copy number = 1 (33.17 muM versus 17.23 muM) and the group
      with a pfmdt copy number >1 (28.28 muM versus 16.11 muM). There was a significant
      difference between the combined low and medium doxycycline IC50 group and the
      high IC50 group in terms of the per cent of isolates with one or more copy
      numbers of the pftetQ gene (0% versus 20.69%) or pfmdt gene (8.33% versus
      37.93%). In the logistic regression model, the pfmdt and pftetQ copy numbers >1
      (odds ratio = 4.65 and 11.47) were independently associated with the high IC50
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Copy numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt are potential predictive
      molecular markers of decreased susceptibility to doxycycline.

TI  - Low prevalence of the molecular markers of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to
      chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine in asymptomatic children in Northern
      Benin.
PG  - 413

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Benin, very few studies have been done on the genetics of
      Plasmodium falciparum and the resistance markers of anti-malarial drugs, while
      malaria treatment policy changed in 2004. Chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine
      pyrimethamine (SP) have been removed and replaced by artemisinin-combination
      therapy (ACT). The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity
      of P. falciparum and the prevalence of P. falciparum molecular markers that are
      associated with resistance to CQ and SP in northern Benin seven years after the
      new policy was instituted. METHODS: The study was conducted in northern Benin, a 
      region characterized by a seasonal malaria transmission. Blood samples were
      collected in 2012 from children presenting with asymptomatic P. falciparum
      infections. Samples collected in filter paper were genotyped by primary and
      nested PCR in block 2 of msp-1 and block 3 of msp-2 to analyse the diversity of
      P. falciparum. The prevalence of critical point mutations in the genes of Pfcrt
      (codon 76), Pfmdr1 (codon 86), Pfdhfr (codons, 51, 59 and 108) and Pfdhps (codons
      437, 540) was examined in parasite isolates by mutation-specific restriction
      enzyme digestion. RESULTS: Genotyping of 195 isolates from asymptomatic children 
      showed 34 msp-1 and 38 msp-2 genotypes. The multiplicity of infection was 4.51
      +/- 0.35 for msp-1 and 4.84 +/- 0.30 for msp-2. Only the codon 51 of Pfdhfr and
      codon 437 of Pfdhps showed a high mutation rate: I51: 64.4% (57.3; 71.2); G437:
      47.4% (40.2; 54.7), respectively. The prevalence of Pfdhfr triple mutant IRN
      (I51, R59 and N108) was 1.5% (0.3; 3.9), and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple mutant IRNG 
      (PfdhfrI51, R59, N108, and PfdhpsG437): 0. 5% (0; 2.5). No mutation was found
      with codon 540 of Pfdhps. Analysis of mutation according to age (younger or older
      than ten years) showed similar frequencies in each category without significant
      difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high
      diversity of P. falciparum in northern Benin with a very low prevalence of
      resistance markers to CQ and SP that dramatically contrasted with the pattern
      observed in southern Benin. No influence of age on genetic diversity of P.
      falciparum and on distribution of the mutations was observed.

AB  - UK National External Quality Assessment Service surveys indicate continuing
      problems in malaria diagnosis: inaccurate calculation of parasitaemia or failure 
      to estimate it altogether, difficulty distinguishing Plasmodium vivax from P.
      ovale, reporting malaria parasites when none were present and misidentification
      of P. falciparum as another species still occur. Therefore, the British Committee
      for Standards in Haematology Guidelines for the Laboratory Diagnosis of Malaria
      have been revised. They are intended for use in the UK but may also prove useful 
      in other non-endemic areas. Routine use of thick and thin films is advised for
      malaria diagnosis. Thick films should be stained using Giemsa or Field stain.
      Thin films should be stained with Giemsa stain or Leishman stain. Thick films
      should be examined by two observers, each viewing a minimum of 200 high power
      fields. If thick films are positive, the species should be determined by
      examination of a thin film. In the case of P. falciparum or P. knowlesi
      infection, the percentage of parasitized cells or the number of parasites per
      microlitre (/mul) should be estimated and reported. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      for malarial antigen cannot replace microscopy but are indicated as a
      supplementary test when malaria diagnosis is performed by relatively
      inexperienced staff. Malaria RDTs are negative in babesiosis.

AB  - The use of a "direct PCR" DNA polymerase enables PCR amplification without any
      prior DNA purification from blood samples due to the enzyme's resistance to
      inhibitors present in blood components. Such DNA polymerases are now commercially
      available. We compared the PCR performance of six direct PCR-type DNA polymerases
      (KOD FX, Mighty Amp, Hemo KlenTaq, Phusion Blood II, KAPA Blood, and BIOTAQ) in
      dried blood eluted from a filter paper with TE buffer. GoTaq Flexi was used as a 
      standard DNA polymerase. PCR performance was evaluated by a nested PCR technique 
      for detecting Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA in the presence of the blood
      components. Although all six DNA polymerases showed resistance to blood
      components compared to the standard Taq polymerase, the KOD FX and BIOTAQ DNA
      polymerases were resistant to inhibitory blood components at concentrations of
      40%, and their PCR performance was superior to that of other DNA polymerases.
      When the reaction mixture contained a mild detergent, only KOD FX DNA polymerase 
      retained the original amount of amplified product. These results indicate that
      KOD FX DNA polymerase is the most resistant to inhibitory blood components and/or
      detergents. Thus, KOD FX DNA polymerase could be useful in serological studies to
      simultaneously detect antibodies and DNA in eluents for antibodies. KOD FX DNA
      polymerase is thus not limited to use in detecting malaria parasites, but could
      also be employed to detect other blood-borne pathogens.

TI  - An innovative tool for moving malaria PCR detection of parasite reservoir into
      the field.
PG  - 405
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-405 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To achieve the goal of malaria elimination in low transmission areas 
      such as in Cambodia, new, inexpensive, high-throughput diagnostic tools for
      identifying very low parasite densities in asymptomatic carriers are required.
      This will enable a switch from passive to active malaria case detection in the
      field. METHODS: DNA extraction and real-time PCR assays were implemented in an
      "in-house" designed mobile laboratory allowing implementation of a robust,
      sensitive and rapid malaria diagnostic strategy in the field. This tool was
      employed in a survey organized in the context of the MalaResT project
      (NCT01663831). RESULTS: The real-time PCR screening and species identification
      assays were performed in the mobile laboratory between October and November 2012,
      in Rattanakiri Province, to screen approximately 5,000 individuals in less than
      four weeks and treat parasite carriers within 24-48 hours after sample
      collection. An average of 240 clinical samples (and 40 quality control samples)
      was tested every day, six/seven days per week. Some 97.7% of the results were
      available <24 hours after the collection. A total of 4.9% were positive for
      malaria. Plasmodium vivax was present in 61.1% of the positive samples,
      Plasmodium falciparum in 45.9%, Plasmodium malariae in 7.0% and Plasmodium ovale 
      in 2.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The operational success of this diagnostic set-up proved
      that molecular testing and subsequent treatment is logistically achievable in
      field settings. This will allow the detection of clusters of asymptomatic
      carriers and to provide useful epidemiological information. Fast results will be 
      of great help for staff in the field to track and treat asymptomatic parasitaemic
      cases. The concept of the mobile laboratory could be extended to other countries 
      for the molecular detection of malaria or other pathogens, or to culture vivax
      parasites, which does not support long-time delay between sample collection and
      culture.

TI  - Evaluation of parasite subpopulations and genetic diversity of the msp1, msp2 and
      glurp genes during and following artesunate monotherapy treatment of Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria in Western Cambodia.
PG  - 403
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread coverage of the emergence of artemisinin
      resistance, relatively little is known about the parasite populations
      responsible. The use of PCR genotyping around the highly polymorphic Plasmodium
      falciparum msp1, msp2 and glurp genes has become well established both to
      describe variability in alleles within a population of parasites, as well as
      classify treatment outcome in cases of recurrent disease. The primary objective
      was to assess the emergence of minority parasite clones during seven days of
      artesunate (AS) treatment in a location with established artemisinin resistance. 
      An additional objective was to investigate whether the classification of clinical
      outcomes remained valid when additional genotyping was performed. METHODS: Blood 
      for parasite genotyping was collected from 143 adult patients presenting with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria during a clinical trial of AS monotherapy in
      Western Cambodia. Nested allelic type-specific amplification of the genes
      encoding the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp1 and msp2) and the
      glutamate-rich protein (glurp) was performed at baseline, daily during seven days
      of treatment, and again at failure. Allelic variants were analysed with respect
      to the size of polymorphisms using Quantity One software to enable identification
      of polyclonal infections. RESULTS: Considerable variation of msp2 alleles but
      well-conserved msp1 and glurp were identified. At baseline, 31% of infections
      were polyclonal for one or more genes. Patients with recurrent malaria were
      significantly more likely to have polyclonal infections than patients without
      recurrence (seven of nine versus 36 of 127, p = 0.004). Emergence of minority
      alleles during treatment was detected in only one of twenty-three cases defined
      as being artemisinin resistant. Moreover, daily genotyping did not alter the
      final outcome classification in any recurrent cases. CONCLUSIONS: The parasites
      responsible for artemisinin-resistant malaria in a clinical trial in Western
      Cambodia comprise the dominant clones of acute malaria infections rather than
      minority clones emerging during treatment. Additional genotyping during therapy
      was not beneficial. Disproportionately high rates of polyclonal infections in
      cases of recurrence suggest complex infections lead to poor treatment outcomes.
      Current research objectives should be broadened to include identification and
      follow-up of recurrent polyclonal infections so as to define their role as
      potential agents of emerging resistance.

TI  - Spleen-dependent regulation of antigenic variation in malaria parasites:
      Plasmodium knowlesi SICAvar expression profiles in splenic and asplenic hosts.
PG  - e78014
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0078014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigenic variation by malaria parasites was first described in
      Plasmodium knowlesi, which infects humans and macaque monkeys, and subsequently
      in P. falciparum, the most virulent human parasite. The schizont-infected cell
      agglutination (SICA) variant proteins encoded by the SICAvar multigene family in 
      P. knowlesi, and Erythrocyte Membrane Protein-1 (EMP-1) antigens encoded by the
      var multigene family in P. falciparum, are expressed at the surface of infected
      erythrocytes, are associated with virulence, and serve as determinants of
      naturally acquired immunity. A parental P. knowlesi clone, Pk1(A+), and a related
      progeny clone, Pk1(B+)1+, derived by an in vivo induced variant antigen switch,
      were defined by the expression of distinct SICA variant protein doublets of
      210/190 and 205/200 kDa, respectively. Passage of SICA[+] infected erythrocytes
      through splenectomized rhesus monkeys results in the SICA[-] phenotype, defined
      by the lack of surface expression and agglutination with variant specific
      antisera. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated SICAvar RNA and protein
      expression in Pk1(A+), Pk1(B+)1+, and SICA[-] parasites. The Pk1(A+) and
      Pk1(B+)1+ parasites express different distinct SICAvar transcript and protein
      repertoires. By comparison, SICA[-] parasites are characterized by a vast
      reduction in SICAvar RNA expression, the lack of full-length SICAvar transcript
      signals on northern blots, and correspondingly, the absence of any SICA protein
      detected by mass spectrometry. SIGNIFICANCE: SICA protein expression may be under
      transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional control, and we show for the
      first time that the spleen, an organ central to blood-stage immunity in malaria, 
      exerts an influence on these processes. Furthermore, proteomics has enabled the
      first in-depth characterization of SICA[+] protein phenotypes and we show that
      the in vivo switch from Pk1(A+) to Pk1(B+)1+ parasites resulted in a complete
      change in SICA profiles. These results emphasize the importance of studying
      antigenic variation in the context of the host environment.

TI  - Surveillance of travellers: an additional tool for tracking antimalarial drug
      resistance in endemic countries.
PG  - e77775
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0077775 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are growing concerns about the emergence of resistance to
      artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Since the widespread adoption of 
      ACTs, there has been a decrease in the systematic surveillance of antimalarial
      drug resistance in many malaria-endemic countries. The aim of this work was to
      test whether data on travellers returning from Africa with malaria could serve as
      an additional surveillance system of local information sources for the emergence 
      of drug resistance in endemic-countries. METHODOLOGY: Data were collected from
      travellers with symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria returning from Senegal 
      (n = 1,993), Mali (n = 2,372), Cote d'Ivoire (n = 4,778) or Cameroon (n = 3,272) 
      and recorded in the French Malaria Reference Centre during the period 1996-2011. 
      Temporal trends of the proportion of parasite isolates that carried the mutant
      genotype, pfcrt 76T, a marker of resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and pfdhfr 108N, 
      a marker of resistance to pyrimethamine, were compared for travellers and
      within-country surveys that were identified through a literature review in
      PubMed. The in vitro response to CQ was also compared between these two groups
      for parasites from Senegal. RESULTS: The trends in the proportion of parasites
      that carried pfcrt 76T, and pfdhfr 108N, were compared for parasites from
      travellers and patients within-country using the slopes of the curves over time; 
      no significant differences in the trends were found for any of the 4 countries.
      These results were supported by in vitro analysis of parasites from the field in 
      Senegal and travellers returning to France, where the trends were also not
      significantly different. CONCLUSION: The results have not shown different trends 
      in resistance between parasites derived from travellers or from parasites
      within-country. This work highlights the value of an international database of
      drug responses in travellers as an additional tool to assess the emergence of
      drug resistance in endemic areas where information is limited.

TI  - Human genetic polymorphisms in the Knops blood group are not associated with a
      protective advantage against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Southern Ghana.
PG  - 400
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex interactions between the human host and the Plasmodium
      falciparum parasite and the factors influencing severity of disease are still not
      fully understood. Human single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs associated with
      Knops blood group system; carried by complement receptor 1 may be associated with
      the pathology of P. falciparum malaria, and susceptibility to disease. METHODS:
      The objective of this study was to determine the genotype and haplotype
      frequencies of the SNPs defining the Knops blood group antigens; Kna/b, McCoya/b,
      Swain-Langley1/2 and KCAM+/- in Ghanaian patients with malaria and determine
      possible associations between these polymorphisms and the severity of the
      disease. Study participants were patients (n = 267) admitted to the emergency
      room at the Department of Child Health, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana 
      during the malaria season from June to August in 1995, 1996 and 1997, classified 
      as uncomplicated malaria (n = 89), severe anaemia (n = 57) and cerebral malaria
      (n = 121) and controls who did not have a detectable Plasmodium infection or were
      symptomless carriers of the parasite (n = 275). The frequencies were determined
      using a post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay,
      developed to detect the SNPs defining the antigens. Chi-square/Fisher's exact
      test and logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: As
      expected, high frequencies of the alleles Kna, McCb, Sl2 and KCAM- were found in 
      the Ghanaian population. Apart from small significant differences between the
      groups at the Sl locus, no significant allelic or genotypic differences were
      found between the controls and the disease groups or between the disease groups. 
      The polymorphisms define eight different haplotypes H1(2.4%), H2(9.4%),
      H3(59.8%), H4(0%), H5(25.2%), H6(0.33%), H7(2.8%) and H8(0%). Investigating these
      haplotypes, no significant differences between any of the groups were found.
      CONCLUSION: The results confirm earlier findings of high frequencies of certain
      CR1 alleles in Africa; and shed more light on earlier conflicting findings; the
      alleles McCb, Sl2, Knb and KCAM- or combined haplotypes do not seem to confer any
      protective advantage against malaria infection or resulting disease severity.
      Based on these findings, in a very well-characterized population, malaria does
      not seem to be the selective force on these alleles.

AB  - The Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource-recommended PLF/UNR/VIR
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Plasmodium vivax in Anopheles 
      spp. mosquitoes collected in South Korea. Samples that were amplified were
      sequenced and compared with known Plasmodium spp. by using the PlasmoDB.org Basic
      Local Alignment Search Tool/n and the National Center for Biotechnology
      Information Basic Local Alignment Search Tool/n tools. Results show that the
      primers PLF/UNR/VIR used in this PCR can produce uninterpretable results and
      non-specific sequences in field-collected mosquitoes. Three additional PCRs
      (PLU/VIV, specific for 18S small subunit ribosomal DNA; Pvr47, specific for a
      nuclear repeat; and GDCW/PLAS, specific for the mitochondrial marker, cytB) were 
      then used to find a more accurate and interpretable assay. Samples that were
      amplified were again sequenced. The PLU/VIV and Pvr47 assays showed
      cross-reactivity with non-Plasmodium spp. and an arthropod fungus (Zoophthora
      lanceolata). The GDCW/PLAS assay amplified only Plasmodium spp. but also
      amplified the non-human specific parasite P. berghei from an Anopheles belenrae
      mosquito. Detection of P. berghei in South Korea is a new finding.

      reference to severe vivax: implications for malaria control.
PG  - 299-304

AB  - Plasmodium vivax is now recognized as a cause of severe and fatal infection in
      many parts of the world. This prospective observational study was undertaken in a
      tertiary health setting to understand the spectrum of the disease burden and
      associated complications due to P. vivax malaria in central India. A malaria
      clinic under Regional Medical Research Centre for Tribals is operational at
      Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College and Hospital, Jabalpur in central
      India, where all fever cases and cases with history of fever were referred for
      screening of malaria parasite by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test kits.
      Confirmation of all the cases was done by PCR targeting 18s ribosomal RNA gene of
      the parasite to exclude mixed infection with P. falciparum. Severe vivax malaria 
      was found in 22 (11.1%) out of 198 vivax patients. Cerebral malaria, seizures,
      severe malaria anaemia, and respiratory distress each were observed in 32%
      subjects. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome was common (36%). Mortality was
      recorded in two patients and neurological sequelae were also observed in two
      patients at the time of discharge. This is the first report from Central India
      where P. vivax has been shown to be associated with severe signs of malaria.
      Severe vivax malaria is a relatively new clinical entity and further studies from
      different parts of the world are needed to understand clinical spectrum and
      burden of P. vivax not only for successful treatment, but also for designing and 
      developing effective malaria control measures.

      States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria
      transmission. However, malaria is also occasionally acquired by persons who have 
      not traveled out of the country, through exposure to infected blood products,
      congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne
      transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify 
      episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for
      travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of 
      illness in 2011 and summarizes trends during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF
      SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or
      rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be reported to local and state health
      departments by health-care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are
      conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to
      CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System, National Notifiable
      Diseases Surveillance System, or direct CDC consults. Data from these reporting
      systems serve as the basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received 1,925 reported 
      cases of malaria with an onset of symptoms in 2011 among persons in the United
      States, including 1,920 cases classified as imported, one laboratory-acquired
      case, one transfusion-related case, two congenital cases, and one cryptic case.
      The total number of cases represents an increase of 14% from the 1,691 cases
      reported for 2010 and the largest number of reported cases since 1971. Plasmodium
      falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in 49%, 22%, 3%, 
      and 3% of cases, respectively. Twenty-one (1%) patients were infected by two
      species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 23% of cases, an
      increase of 5 percentage points from 2010. Of the 871 patients who reported
      purpose of travel, 607 (70%) were visiting friends or relatives (VFR). Among the 
      929 cases in U.S. civilians for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and
      travel region was known, 57 (6%) patients reported that they had followed and
      adhered to a chemoprophylactic drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to
      which they had traveled. Thirty-seven cases were reported in pregnant women,
      among whom only one adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported cases,
      significantly more cases (n=275 [14%]) were classified as severe infections in
      2011 compared with 2010 (n=183 [11%]; p=0.0018; chi square). Five persons with
      malaria died in 2011. After 2 years of improvement in completion of data elements
      on the malaria case form, higher percentages of incomplete data in 2011 for
      residential status (from 11% in 2010 to 19% in 2011) and species (from 18% in
      2010 to 22% in 2011) were noted. INTERPRETATION: The number of cases reported in 
      2011 marked the largest number of cases since 1971 (N = 3,180). Despite progress 
      in reducing the global burden of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many
      regions, and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still
      inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Completion of data elements on the malaria
      case report form decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. This incomplete reporting 
      compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and prevent infections.
      VFR travelers continue to be a difficult population to reach with effective
      malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies that
      effectively target VFR travelers need to be developed and implemented to have a
      substantial impact on the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States.
      Although more persons with cases reported taking chemoprophylaxis to prevent
      malaria, the majority reported not taking it, and adherence was poor among those 
      who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will
      prevent the majority of malaria illness and reduce the risk for severe disease
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be
      fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications
      appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of
      malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.
      Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria and contact
      the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advice, when needed. Malaria
      treatment recommendations can be obtained online
      (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling the Malaria
      Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713).

      cerebral malaria.
PG  - 388
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a clinical syndrome resulting from
      Plasmodium falciparum infection. A wide range of clinical manifestations follow
      the disease including cognitive dysfunction, seizures and coma. CM pathogenesis
      remains incompletely understood and without treatment this condition is
      invariably fatal. Artesunate has been accepted as the most effective drug for
      treating severe malaria. Besides its antiparasitic activity, an anti-inflammatory
      property has also been reported. In the current study, the immunomodulatory role 
      of artesunate was investigated using a Plasmodium berghei ANKA model of CM,
      trough evaluation of behavioural changes and cytokines expression in hippocampus 
      and in frontal cortex. METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice were infected with P. berghei by
      intraperitoneal route, using a standardized inoculation of 106 parasitized
      erythrocytes. Memory function was evaluated using the step-down inhibitory
      avoidance test. The mRNA expression of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF in the
      frontal cortex and hippocampus of control and infected mice on day 5
      post-infection were estimated by quantitative real time PCR. Plasmodium berghei
      -infected mice also received intraperitoneally a single dose of artesunate (32
      mg/kg) on day 4 post-infection, and 24 hours after treatment behavioural and
      immunological analysis were performed. The protein levels of cytokines IL-2,
      IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma, TNF in the serum, frontal cortex and hippocampus
      of controls and P. berghei -infected mice treated or not treated with artesunate 
      were determined using a cytometric bead array (CBA) kit. The survival and
      neurological symptoms of CM were also registered. RESULTS: CM mice presented a
      significant impairment of aversive memory compared to controls on day 5
      post-infection. A higher mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was found 
      in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of infected mice. A single dose of
      artesunate was also able to decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines in 
      the hippocampus and frontal cortex of P. berghei-infected mice. In parallel, a
      significant improvement in neurological symptoms and survival were observed in
      artesunate treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the current study provided
      further evidence that CM affects key brain areas related to cognition process. In
      addition, different patterns of cytokine expression during the course of CM could
      be modulated by a single administration of the anti-malarial artesunate.

TI  - Performance of a HRP-2/pLDH based rapid diagnostic test at the
      Bangladesh-India-Myanmar border areas for diagnosis of clinical malaria.
PG  - 378
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) has been adopted in contemporary
      malaria control and management programmes around the world as it represents a
      fast and apt alternative for malaria diagnosis in a resource-limited setting.
      This study assessed the performance of a HRP-2/pLDH based RDT (Parascreen(R)
      Pan/Pf) in a laboratory setting utilizing clinical samples obtained from the
      field. METHODS: Whole blood samples were obtained from febrile patients referred 
      for malaria diagnosis by clinicians from two different Upazila Health Complexes
      (UHCs) located near the Bangladesh-India and Bangladesh-Myanmar border where
      malaria is endemic. RDT was performed on archived samples and sensitivity and
      specificity evaluated with expert microscopy (EM) and quantitative PCR (qPCR).
      RESULTS: A total of 327 clinical samples were made available for the study, of
      which 153 were Plasmodium falciparum-positive and 54 were Plasmodium
      vivax-positive. In comparison with EM, for P. falciparum malaria, the RDT had
      sensitivity: 96.0% (95% CI, 91.2-98.3) and specificity: 98.2% (95% CI, 94.6-99.5)
      and for P. vivax, sensitivity: 90.7% (95% CI, 78.9-96.5) and specificity: 98.9%
      (95% CI, 96.5-99.7). Comparison with qPCR showed, for P. falciparum malaria,
      sensitivity: 95.4% (95% CI, 90.5-98.0) and specificity: 98.8% (95% CI, 95.4-99.7)
      and for P. vivax malaria, sensitivity: 89.0% (95% CI,77.0-95.4) and specificity: 
      98.8% (95% CI, 96.5-99.7). Sensitivity varied according to different parasitaemia
      for falciparum and vivax malaria diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Parascreen(R) Pan/Pf
      Rapid test for malaria showed acceptable sensitivity and specificity in border
      belt endemic areas of Bangladesh when compared with EM and qPCR.

TI  - Increased pfmdr1 gene copy number and the decline in pfcrt and pfmdr1 resistance 
      alleles in Ghanaian Plasmodium falciparum isolates after the change of
      anti-malarial drug treatment policy.
PG  - 377
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) 
      in 2005, monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy, which includes the use of
      molecular tools to detect known genetic markers of parasite resistance, is
      important for first-hand information on the changes in parasite susceptibility to
      drugs in Ghana. This study investigated the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug
      resistance gene (pfmdr1) copy number, mutations and the chloroquine resistance
      transporter gene (pfcrt) mutations in Ghanaian isolates collected in seven years 
      to detect the trends in prevalence of mutations. METHODS: Archived filter paper
      blood blots collected from children aged below five years with uncomplicated
      malaria in 2003-2010 at sentinel sites were used. Using quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 756 samples were assessed for pfmdr1 gene
      copy number. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to
      detect alleles of pfmdr1 86 in 1,102 samples, pfmdr1 184, 1034, 1042 and 1246 in 
      832 samples and pfcrt 76 in 1,063 samples. Merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2)
      genotyping was done to select monoclonal infections for copy number analysis.
      RESULTS: The percentage of isolates with increased pfmdr1 copy number were 4, 27,
      9, and 18% for 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08 and 2010, respectively. Significant
      increasing trends for prevalence of pfmdr1 N86 (x(2) = 96.31, p <0.001) and pfcrt
      K76 (x(2) = 64.50, p <0.001) and decreasing trends in pfmdr1 Y86 (x(2) = 38.52, p
      <0.001) and pfcrt T76 (x(2) = 43.49, p <0.001) were observed from 2003-2010. The 
      pfmdr1 F184 and Y184 prevalence showed an increasing and decreasing trends
      respectively but were not significant (x(2) = 7.39,p=0.060; x(2) = 7.49, p =
      0.057 respectively). The pfmdr1 N86-F184-D1246 haplotype, which is alleged to be 
      selected by artemether-lumefantrine showed a significant increasing trend (x(2) =
      20.75, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Increased pfmdr1 gene copy number was observed in 
      the isolates analysed and this finding has implications for the use of ACT in the
      country although no resistance has been reported. The decreasing trend in the
      prevalence of chloroquine resistance markers after change of treatment policy
      presents the possibility for future introduction of chloroquine as prophylaxis
      for malaria risk groups such as children and pregnant women in Ghana.

TI  - Characteristic age distribution of Plasmodium vivax infections after malaria
      elimination on Aneityum Island, Vanuatu.
PG  - 243-52
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00931-13 [doi]
AB  - Resurgence is a major concern after malaria elimination. After the initiation of 
      the elimination program on Aneityum Island in 1991, microscopy showed that
      Plasmodium falciparum disappeared immediately, whereas P. vivax disappeared from 
      1996 onward, until P. vivax cases were reported in January 2002. By conducting
      malariometric surveys of the entire population of Aneityum, we investigated the
      age distribution of individuals with parasites during this epidemic in the
      context of antimalarial antibody levels and parasite antigen diversity. In July
      2002, P. vivax infections were detected by microscopy in 22/759 individuals:
      20/298 born after the beginning of the elimination program in 1991, 2/126 born
      between 1982 and 1991, and none of 335 born before 1982. PCR increased the number
      of infections detected to 77, distributed among all age groups. Prevalences were 
      12.1%, 16.7%, and 6.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). In November, a similar age
      pattern was found, but with fewer infections: 6/746 and 39/741 individuals were
      found to be infected by microscopy and PCR, respectively. The frequencies of
      antibody responses to P. vivax were significantly higher in individuals born
      before 1991 than in younger age groups and were similar to those on Malakula
      Island, an area of endemicity. Remarkably low antigen diversity (h, 0.15) of P.
      vivax infections was observed on Aneityum compared with the other islands (h,
      0.89 to 1.0). A P. vivax resurgence was observed among children and teenagers on 
      Aneityum, an age distribution similar to those before elimination and on islands 
      where P. vivax is endemic, suggesting that in the absence of significant
      exposure, immunity may persist, limiting infection levels in adults. The limited 
      parasite gene pool on islands may contribute to this protection.

TI  - Prevalence of polymorphisms in antifolate drug resistance molecular marker genes 
      pvdhfr and pvdhps in clinical isolates of Plasmodium vivax from Kolkata, India.
PG  - 196-200
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01171-13 [doi]
AB  - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has never been recommended for the treatment of
      Plasmodium vivax malaria as the parasite is intrinsically resistant to
      pyrimethamine. The combination was introduced as a promising agent to treat
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many countries but was withdrawn after a few
      years due to development and spread of resistant strains. Presently,
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is used as a partner drug of artemisinin-based
      combination therapy to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and a combination 
      of artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is currently in use in India. In
      countries like India, where both P. vivax and P. falciparum are equally
      prevalent, some proportion of P. vivax bacteria is exposed to
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine due to misdiagnosis and mixed infections. As reports on
      the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in P. vivax are
      rare, the study of mutations in the marker genes P. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
      pvdhps is important for predicting drug selection pressure and
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance monitoring. We studied the prevalence of
      point mutations and haplotypes of both the genes in 80 P. vivax isolates
      collected from urban Kolkata, India, by the DNA sequencing method. Point mutation
      rates in both the genes were low. The double mutant pvdhfr A15N50R58N117I173
      (mutations are in boldface) and the single mutant pvdhps genotype
      S382G383K512A553V585 were more prevalent, while 35% of the isolates harbored the 
      wild-type genotype. The triple mutant ANRNI-SGKAV was found in 29.9% isolates. No
      quintuple mutant genotype was recorded. The P. vivax parasites in urban Kolkata
      may still be susceptible to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Hence, a combination of
      antimalarial drugs like artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine introduced for P.
      falciparum infection might be effective in P. vivax infection also. Study of the 
      therapeutic efficacy of this combination in P. vivax is thus strongly suggested.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of Plasmodium
      falciparum by analyzing the polymorphism of the msp-1 and msp-2 genes and the
      multiplicity of infection in children with uncomplicated malaria in southern
      Benin. Blood samples of children with fever or history of fever with thick smear 
      positive P. falciparum were collected on filter paper. After extraction of DNA by
      Chelex(R), the samples underwent nested PCR. 93 isolates from children were
      genotyped. For the msp-1 gene, the K1 and R033 sequences were the most
      represented in the study population with 85.2% and 83% prevalence, respectively. 
      Regarding the msp-2 gene, the FC27 family was more highly represented with 99%
      prevalence against 81.5% for 3D7. Mixed infections accounted for 80.4% of the
      samples. Twenty-five alleles were identified for msp-1 and 28 for msp-2. Fourteen
      and ten alleles belonged to the K1 (100-500 bp) and MAD20 (100-500 bp) families, 
      respectively. The RO33 sequence did not show any polymorphism, with only one
      variant (160 bp) detected. The msp-2 gene was present as 16 FC27 family fragments
      (250-800 bp) and 12 of the 3D7 family (350-700 bp). The multiplicity of infection
      was estimated at 3.8 for msp-1 and 3.9 for msp-2 with 77 (87.5%) and 84 (91.3%)
      samples harboring more than one parasite genotype for msp-1 and msp-2,
      respectively. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was influenced neither by age
      nor by parasite density. This study shows a significant diversity of P.
      falciparum in southern Benin with an MOI unaffected by age or by parasite
      density.

      reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 inhibit parasite growth and predict
      protection from malaria.
PG  - 789-98
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5
      (PfRH5) is a blood-stage parasite protein essential for host erythrocyte
      invasion. PfRH5-specific antibodies raised in animals inhibit parasite growth in 
      vitro, but the relevance of naturally acquired PfRH5-specific antibodies in
      humans is unclear. METHODS: We assessed pre-malaria season PfRH5-specific
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in 357 Malian children and adults who were
      uninfected with Plasmodium. Subsequent P. falciparum infections were detected by 
      polymerase chain reaction every 2 weeks and malaria episodes by weekly physical
      examination and self-referral for 7 months. The primary outcome was time between 
      the first P. falciparum infection and the first febrile malaria episode.
      PfRH5-specific IgG was assayed for parasite growth-inhibitory activity. RESULTS: 
      The presence of PfRH5-specific IgG at enrollment was associated with a longer
      time between the first blood-stage infection and the first malaria episode
      (PfRH5-seropositive median: 71 days, PfRH5-seronegative median: 18 days; P =
      .001). This association remained significant after adjustment for age and other
      factors associated with malaria risk/exposure (hazard ratio, .62; P = .02).
      Concentrated PfRH5-specific IgG purified from Malians inhibited P. falciparum
      growth in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Naturally acquired PfRH5-specific IgG inhibits
      parasite growth in vitro and predicts protection from malaria. These findings
      strongly support efforts to develop PfRH5 as an urgently needed blood-stage
      malaria vaccine. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01322581.

TI  - [Efficacy and safety of antimalarial combinations for treatment of uncomplicated 
      malaria in children in Bangui, Central African Republic].
PG  - 313-9
LID - 10.1684/mst.2013.0229 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three
      anti-malarial combinations--artemether-lumefantrine (A-L),
      amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ-SP), and artesunate-amodiaquine
      (AQ-AS)--in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children younger than 5
      years in Bangui, Central African Republic. METHODOLOGY: This study included 186
      children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria who were treated 
      at the Bede Combattant Hospital from July through October 2010: 63 randomized to 
      receive A-L, 63 AQ-SP, and 60 AQ-AS. Clinical outcome was classified according to
      WHO criteria as early treatment failure (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF), late 
      parasitological failure (LPF), or adequate clinical and parasitological response 
      (ACPR). The occurrence of mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr-1, dhfr and dhps genes
      was studied by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: After PCR correction, ACPR at D28 was 100% for 
      A-L, 96.55% for AQ-SP, and 100% for AQ-AS, with no significant difference between
      the three combinations (p = 0.36). The 2 cases of treatment failure for AQ-SP
      were associated with mutations at the following resistance markers: Pfcrt 76T,
      PfmdrI 86Y, Dhfr 108N, and Dhps A437. There was no significant difference in the 
      reduction of anemia, fever (p = 0.87), or parasitemia (p = 0.63) between the
      three combinations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that artemisinin-based
      combinations are still effective and tolerated in the treatment of uncomplicated 
      malaria in children younger than 5 years in Bangui. Treatment failures were due
      to new infections and mutations in resistance markers.

TI  - Distribution of erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) gene dimorphic alleles 
      in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Sudan.
PG  - 469
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-13-469 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Erythrocyte Binding Antigen (EBA) 175 has been considered as one 
      of the most important Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) merozoite ligands
      that mediate invasion of the erythrocytes through their sialated receptor:
      Glycophorin A (GPA). The effect of the EBA 175 dimorphic alleles (F and C) on the
      severity of the disease is not yet fully understood. Therefore this study was
      designed to assess the distribution of the divergent dimorphic alleles of P.
      falciparum EBA-175 (F and C) in three different geographical areas in Sudan and
      the possible association of this dimorphism with the severity of the disease.
      METHODS: A sum of 339 field isolates of P. falciparum obtained from patients in
      three different geographical areas in Sudan were screened for the dimorphic
      alleles (F, C) of the EBA-175 using nested PCR. RESULTS: The percentage of F, C, 
      and mixed F/C alleles were; 41%, 51%, and 8% respectively. F and C alleles showed
      significantly different distributions in the various geographic areas (p = 0.00).
      There was no significant association between malaria clinical manifestation and
      P. falciparum EBA-175 F and C alleles frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed
      a significant differential distribution of F and C alleles in different
      geographical malaria endemic areas. No significant association was observed
      between F and C alleles and different malaria phenotypes.

TI  - The structurally related auxin and melatonin tryptophan-derivatives and their
      roles in Arabidopsis thaliana and in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
      falciparum.
PG  - 646-51
LID - 10.1111/jeu.12080 [doi]
AB  - Indole compounds are involved in a range of functions in many organisms. In the
      human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, melatonin and other tryptophan
      derivatives are able to modulate its intraerythrocytic cycle, increasing the
      schizont population as well as parasitemia, likely through ubiquitin-proteasome
      system (UPS) gene regulation. In plants, melatonin regulates root development, in
      a similar way to that described for indoleacetic acid, suggesting that melatonin 
      and indoleacetic acid could co-participate in some physiological processes due to
      structural similarities. In the present work, we evaluate whether the chemical
      structure similarity found in indoleacetic acid and melatonin can lead to similar
      effects in Arabidopsis thaliana lateral root formation and P. falciparum cell
      cycle modulation, as well as in the UPS of gene regulation, by qRT-PCR. Our data 
      show that P. falciparum is not able to respond to indoleacetic acid either in the
      modulation of the intraerythrocytic cycle or in the gene regulation mediated by
      the UPS as observed for melatonin. The similarities of these indole compounds are
      not sufficient to confer synergistic functions in P. falciparum cell cycle
      modulation, but could interplay in A. thaliana lateral root formation.

TI  - Impact of trehalose transporter knockdown on Anopheles gambiae stress adaptation 
      and susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum infection.
PG  - 17504-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1316709110 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles gambiae is a major vector mosquito for Plasmodium falciparum, the
      deadly pathogen causing most human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Synthesized in 
      the fat body, trehalose is the predominant sugar in mosquito hemolymph. It not
      only provides energy but also protects the mosquito against desiccation and heat 
      stresses. Trehalose enters the mosquito hemolymph by the trehalose transporter
      AgTreT1. In adult female A. gambiae, AgTreT1 is predominantly expressed in the
      fat body. We found that AgTreT1 expression is induced by environmental stresses
      such as low humidity or elevated temperature. AgTreT1 RNA silencing reduces the
      hemolymph trehalose concentration by 40%, and the mosquitoes succumb sooner after
      exposure to desiccation or heat. After an infectious blood meal, AgTreT1 RNA
      silencing reduces the number of P. falciparum oocysts in the mosquito midgut by
      over 70% compared with mock-injected mosquitoes. These data reveal important
      roles for AgTreT1 in stress adaptation and malaria pathogen development in a
      major vector mosquito. Thus, AgTreT1 may be a potential target for malaria vector
      control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and patterns of pfcrt and pfmdr1
      polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolates collected from
      the malaria endemic area of Thailand along Thai-Myanmar border. METHODS: Dried
      blood spot samples were collected from 172 falciparum malaria patients prior
      received treatment. The samples were extracted using chelex to obtain parasite
      DNA. PCR-RFLP was employed to detect pfcrt mutation at codons 76, 220, 271, 326, 
      356 and 371, and the pfmdr1 mutation at codon 86. Pfmdr1 gene copy number was
      determined by SYBR Green I real-time PCR. RESULTS: Mutant alleles of pfcrt and
      wild type allele of pfmdr1 were found in almost all samples. Pfmdr1 gene copy
      number in isolates collected from all areas ranged from 1.0 to 5.0 copies and
      proportion of isolates carrying>1 gene copies was 38.1%. The distribution and
      patterns of pfcrt and pfmdr1 mutations were similar in P. falciparum isolates
      from all areas. However, significant differences in both number of pfmdr1 copies 
      and prevalence of isolates carrying>1 gene copies were observed among isolates
      collected from different areas. The median pfmdr1 copy number in P. falciparum
      collected from Kanchanaburi and Mae Hongson were 2.5 and 2.0, respectively and
      more than half of the isolates carried>1 gene copies. CONCLUSIONS: The
      observation of pfmdr1 wild type and increasing of gene copy number may suggest
      declining of artesunate-mefloquine treatment efficacy in P. falciparum isolates
      in this border area.

TI  - Detection of a substantial number of sub-microscopic Plasmodium falciparum
      infections by polymerase chain reaction: a potential threat to malaria control
      and diagnosis in Ethiopia.
PG  - 352
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt and effective malaria diagnosis not only alleviates individual
      suffering, but also decreases malaria transmission at the community level. The
      commonly used diagnostic methods, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests, are
      usually insensitive at very low-density parasitaemia. Molecular techniques, on
      the other hand, allow the detection of low-level, sub-microscopic parasitaemia.
      This study aimed to explore the presence of sub-microscopic Plasmodium falciparum
      infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR-based parasite
      prevalence was compared against microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
      METHODS: This study used 1,453 blood samples collected from clinical patients and
      sub-clinical subjects to determine the prevalence of sub-microscopic P.
      falciparum carriages. Subsets of RDT and microscopy negative blood samples were
      tested by PCR while all RDT and microscopically confirmed P. falciparum-infected 
      samples were subjected to PCR. Finger-prick blood samples spotted on filter paper
      were used for parasite genomic DNA extraction. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      sub-microscopic P. falciparum carriage was 19.2% (77/400) (95% CI = 15. 4-23.1). 
      Microscopy-based prevalence of P. falciparum infection was 3.7% (54/1,453) while 
      the prevalence was 6.9% (100/1,453) using RDT alone. Using microscopy and PCR,
      the estimated parasite prevalence was 20.6% if PCR were performed in 1,453 blood 
      samples. The prevalence was estimated to be 22.7% if RDT and PCR were used. Of 54
      microscopically confirmed P. falciparum-infected subjects, PCR detected 90.7%
      (49/54). Out of 100 RDT-confirmed P. falciparum infections; PCR detected 80.0%
      (80/100). The sensitivity of PCR relative to microscopy and RDT was, therefore,
      90.7% and 80%, respectively. The sensitivity of microscopy and RDT relative to
      PCR was 16.5 (49/299) and 24.2% (80/330), respectively. The overall PCR-based
      prevalence of P. falciparum infection was 5.6- and 3.3 fold higher than that
      determined by microscopy and RDT, respectively. None of the sub-microscopic
      subjects had severe anaemia, though 29.4% had mild anaemia (10-11.9 g/dl).
      CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic, low-density malaria infection was common in the study 
      area and PCR may be a better tool for measuring Plasmodium prevalence than
      microscopy and RDT. The inadequate sensitivity of the diagnostic methods to
      detect substantial number of sub-microscopic parasitaemia would undoubtedly
      affect malaria control efforts, making reduction of transmission more difficult. 
      RDT and microscopy-based prevalence studies and subsequent reports of reduction
      in malaria incidence underestimate the true pictures of P. falciparum infections 
      in the community. PCR, on the other hand, seems to have reasonable sensitivity to
      detect a higher number of infected subjects with low and sub-microscopic parasite
      densities than RDTs or microscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Babesiosis is an emerging health risk in several parts of the world. 
      However, little is known about the prevalence of Babesia in malaria-endemic
      countries. The area along the China-Myanmar border in Yunnan is a main endemic
      area of malaria in P.R. China, however, human infection with Babesia microti (B. 
      microti) is not recognized in this region, and its profile of co-infection is not
      yet clear. METHODS: To understand its profile of co-infections with B. microti,
      our investigation was undertaken in the malaria-endemic area along the
      China-Myanmar border in Yunnan between April 2012 and June 2013. Four parasite
      species, including B. microti, Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), P. vivax,
      and P. malariae, were identified among 449 suspected febrile persons detected by 
      nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on small subunit ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) genes of B. microti and Plasmodium spp. RESULTS: Of all
      the collected samples from febrile patients, mono-infection with B. microti, P.
      vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae accounted for 1.8% (8/449), 9.8% (44/449), 
      2.9% (13/449), and 0.2% (1/449), respectively. The rate of mixed infections of B.
      microti with P. falciparum or P. vivax are both 0.2% (1/449), and mixed
      infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax accounted for 1.1% (5/449). CONCLUSIONS:
      This report supports the hypothesis that babesiosis caused by B. microti is
      emerging along the China-Myanmar border in the Yunnan province, P.R. China, but
      it was ignored because of low parasitemia or mixed infection with Plasmodium spp.
      More sensitive and specific diagnosis methods are needed to find the rapid
      response mechanism of emergency for babesiosis and malaria co-prevalence areas.

TI  - Dynamics of the major histocompatibility complex class I processing and
      presentation pathway in the course of malaria parasite development in human
      hepatocytes: implications for vaccine development.
PG  - e75321
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0075321 [doi]
AB  - Control of parasite replication exerted by MHC class I restricted CD8+ T-cells in
      the liver is critical for vaccination-induced protection against malaria. While
      many intracellular pathogens subvert the MHC class I presentation machinery, its 
      functionality in the course of malaria replication in hepatocytes has not been
      characterized. Using experimental systems based on specific identification,
      isolation and analysis of human hepatocytes infected with P. berghei ANKA GFP or 
      P. falciparum 3D7 GFP sporozoites we demonstrated that molecular components of
      the MHC class I pathway exhibit largely unaltered expression in malaria-infected 
      hepatocytes until very late stages of parasite development. Furthermore, infected
      cells showed no obvious defects in their capacity to upregulate expression of
      different molecular components of the MHC class I machinery in response to
      pro-inflammatory lymphokines or trigger direct activation of allo-specific or
      peptide-specific human CD8+ T-cells. We further demonstrate that ectopic
      expression of circumsporozoite protein does not alter expression of critical
      genes of the MHC class I pathway and its response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
      In addition, we identified supra-cellular structures, which arose at late stages 
      of parasite replication, possessed the characteristic morphology of merosomes and
      exhibited nearly complete loss of surface MHC class I expression. These data have
      multiple implications for our understanding of natural T-cell immunity against
      malaria and may promote development of novel, efficient anti-malaria vaccines
      overcoming immune escape of the parasite in the liver.

TI  - High performance of histidine-rich protein 2 based rapid diagnostic tests in
      French Guiana are explained by the absence of pfhrp2 gene deletion in P.
      falciparum.
PG  - e74269
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0074269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Care for malaria patients in endemic areas has been improved through 
      the increasing use of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs). Most RDTs target the
      histidine-rich protein-2 antigen (PfHRP2) to detect P. falciparum, as it is
      abundant and shows great heat stability. However, their use in South America has 
      been widely questioned following a recent publication that pinpoints the high
      prevalence of Peruvian field isolates lacking the gene encoding this protein. In 
      the remote rural health centers of French Guiana, RDTs are the main diagnosis
      tools. Therefore, a study of PfHRP2 RDT performances and pfhrp2 genotyping was
      conducted to determine whether a replacement of the current pLDH-based kit could 
      be considered. METHODS: The performance study compared the SD Malaria Ag test
      P.f/Pan(R) kit with the current gold standard diagnosis by microscopy. The
      prevalence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions were evaluated from 221 P. falciparum
      isolates collected between 2009 and 2011 in French Guiana. RESULTS: Between
      January 2010 and August 2011, 960 suspected cases of malaria were analyzed using 
      microscopy and RDTs. The sensitivity of the SD Malaria Ag test P.f/Pan(R) for
      detection of P. falciparum was 96.8% (95% CI: 90.9-99.3), and 86.0% (95% CI:
      78.9-91.5) for the detection of P. vivax. No isolates (95% CI: 0-4.5) lacking
      either exon of the pfhrp2 gene were identified among the 221 P. falciparum
      isolates analyzed, but 7.4% (95% CI: 2.8-15.4) lacked the exon 2 part of the
      pfhrp3 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Field isolates lacking either exon of the pfhrp2 gene
      are absent in this western part of South America. Despite its sensibility to
      detect P. vivax, the SD Malaria Ag test P.f/Pan(R) kit is a satisfying
      alternative to microscopy in remote health centers, where it is difficult to
      provide highly skilled microscopists and to maintain the necessary equipment.

AB  - Expanded malaria control in Kenya since the early 2000s has resulted in marked
      reduction in hospital admissions for malaria; however, no studies have reported
      changes in malaria infection rates in the same population over this period.
      Randomly selected archived blood samples from four cohorts of pregnant women and 
      their children from 1996 to 2010 in Kwale District, Coast Province, Kenya, were
      examined for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), P. malariae, P. ovale, and Plasmodium
      vivax by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy. Maternal
      delivery Pf prevalence by PCR declined from 40% in 2000-2005 to 1% in 2009-2010, 
      concordant with increased bed net and malaria chemoprophylaxis use. Individual
      risk of Pf infection in children from birth to 3 years in serial longitudinal
      cohort studies declined from almost 100% in 1996-1999 to 15% in 2006-2010.
      Declines in P. malariae and P. ovale infections rates were also observed. These
      results show a profound reduction in malaria transmission in coastal Kenya.

TI  - Usefulness of Plasmodium falciparum-specific rapid diagnostic tests for
      assessment of parasite clearance and detection of recurrent infections after
      artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 349
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-349 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is an important tool for parasite-based
      malaria diagnosis. High specificity of RDTs to distinguish an active Plasmodium
      falciparum infection from residual antigens from a previous infection is crucial 
      in endemic areas where residents are repeatedly exposed to malaria. The
      efficiency of two RDTs based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens were studied and compared with two microscopy
      techniques (Giemsa and acridine orange-stained blood smears) and real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for assessment of initial clearance and detection
      of recurrent P. falciparum infections after artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT) in a moderately high endemic area of rural Tanzania. METHODS: In this
      exploratory study 53 children < five years with uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria infection were followed up on nine occasions, i.e., day 1, 2, 3, 7, 14,
      21, 28, 35 and 42, after initiation of artemether-lumefantrine treatment. At each
      visit capillary blood samples was collected for the HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs,
      Giemsa and acridine orange-stained blood smears for microscopy and real-time PCR.
      Assessment of clearance times and detection of recurrent P. falciparum infections
      were done for all diagnostic methods. RESULTS: The median clearance times were 28
      (range seven to >42) and seven (two to 14) days for HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs, two 
      (one to seven) and two (one to 14) days for Giemsa and acridine orange-stained
      blood smear and two (one to 28) days for real-time PCR. RDT specificity against
      Giemsa-stained blood smear microscopy was 21% for HRP2 on day 14, reaching 87% on
      day 42, and >/=96% from day 14 to 42 for LDH. There was no significant
      correlation between parasite density at enrolment and duration of HRP2 positivity
      (r = 0.13, p = 0.34). Recurrent malaria infections occurred in ten (19%)
      children. The HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs did not detect eight and two of the
      recurrent infections, respectively. CONCLUSION: The LDH-based RDT was superior to
      HRP2-based for monitoring of treatment outcome and detection of recurrent
      infections after ACT in this moderately high transmission setting. The results
      may have implications for the choice of RDT devices in similar transmission
      settings for improved malaria case management. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

PG  - 346
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the
      dominant species accounting for roughly 60 and 40% of malaria cases,
      respectively. Recently a major shift from P. falciparum to P. vivax has been
      observed in various parts of the country but the epidemiology of the other human 
      malaria species, Plasmodium ovale spp. and Plasmodium malariae remains poorly
      understood. The aim of this study was to assess P. ovale curtisi and wallikeri
      infection in north-west Ethiopia by using microscopy and nested PCR. METHODS: A
      health institution-based survey using non-probability sampling techniques was
      conducted at Maksegnet, Enfranze and Kola Diba health centres and Metema hospital
      in North Gondar. Three-hundred patients with signs and symptoms consistent with
      malaria were included in this study and capillary blood was collected for
      microscopic examination and molecular analysis of Plasmodium species. Samples
      were collected on Whatman 903 filter papers, stored in small plastic bags with
      desiccant and transported to Vienna (Austria) for molecular analysis. Data from
      study participants were entered and analysed by SPSS 20 software. RESULTS: Out of
      300 study participants (167 males and 133 females), 184 samples were classified
      positive for malaria (133 P. falciparum and 51 P. vivax) by microscopy. By
      species-specific PCR 233 Plasmodium spp (95% CI: 72.6-82) were detected and the
      majority 155 (66.5%, 95% CI: 60.2-72.3) were P. falciparum followed by P. vivax
      69 (29.6%, 95% CI; 24.1-35.8) and 9 (3.9%, 95% CI: 2-7.2) samples were positive
      for P. ovale. Seven of P. ovale parasites were confirmed as P. ovale wallikeri
      and two were confirmed as P. ovale curtisi. None of the samples tested positive
      for P. malariae. During microscopic examination there were high (16.3%) false
      negative reports and all mixed infections and P. ovale cases were missed or
      misclassified. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that P. ovale malaria is
      under-reported in Ethiopia and provides the first known evidence of the sympatric
      distribution of indigenous P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi in Ethiopia.
      Therefore, further studies assessing the prevalence of the rare species P. ovale 
      and P. malariae are urgently needed to better understand the species distribution
      and to adapt malaria control strategies.

TI  - Sequence Diversity of pfmdr1 and Sequence Conserve of pldh in Plasmodium
      falciparum from Indonesia: Its implications on Designing a Novel Antimalarial
      Drug with Less Prone to Resistance.
PG  - 522-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: pfmdr1 and its variants are molecular marker which are responsible
      for antibiotics resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, a parasitic carrier for
      malaria disease. A novel strategy to treat malaria disease is by disrupting
      parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a crucial enzyme for Plasmodium survival
      during their erythrocytic stages. This research was aimed to investigate and
      characterize the pfmdr1 and pldh genes of P. falciparum isolated from Nusa
      Tenggara Indonesia. METHODS: Genomic DNA of P.falciparum was isolated from
      malaria patients in Nusa Tenggara Indonesia. pfmdr1 was amplified using nested
      PCR and genotyped using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). pldh was
      amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using NCBI public domain databases and
      alignment using Clustal W ver. 1.83. RESULTS: Genotyping of the pfmdr1 revealed
      that sequence diversity was extremely high among isolates. However, a sequence
      analysis of pldh indicated that open reading frame of 316 amino acids of the gene
      showing 100% homology to the P. falciparum 3D7 reference pldh (GeneBank:
      XM_001349953.1). CONCLUSION: This is the first report which confirms the
      heterologous of pfmdr1 and the homologous sequences of P.falciparum pldh isolated
      from Nusa Tenggara Islands of Indonesia, indicating that the chloroquine could
      not be used effectively as antimalarial target in the region and the
      pLDH-targeted antimalarial compound would have higher chance to be successful
      than using chloroquine for curbing malaria worldwide.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum: genetic diversity and complexity of infections in an
      isolated village in western Thailand.

AB  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum is intimately associated with
      morbidity, mortality and malaria control strategies. It is therefore imperative
      to study genetic makeup and population structure of this parasite in endemic
      areas. In Kong Mong Tha, an isolated village in western Thailand, the majority of
      P. falciparum infections are asymptomatic. In this study we investigated
      complexity of infections and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P.
      falciparum population of Kong Mong Tha, and compared results with those
      previously obtained from Mae Sod, in northwestern Thailand, where the majority of
      infections were symptomatic. Using PCR-based determination of the 5' merozoite
      surface protein 1 gene (msp1) recombinant types, we found that 39% of 59 P.
      falciparum isolates from Kong Mong Tha had multiple 5' recombinant types with a
      mean number of 1.54. These values were much lower than those obtained from Mae
      Sod: 96% for multiple infections and with a mean number of 3.61. Analysis of
      full-length sequences of two housekeeping genes, the P-type Ca(2+)-transporting
      ATPase gene (n=33) plus adenylosuccinate lyase gene (n=33), and three vaccine
      candidate antigen genes, msp1 (n=26), the circumsporozoite protein gene, csp
      (n=30) and the apical membrane antigen 1 gene, ama 1 (n=32), revealed that in all
      of these genes within-population SNP diversity was at similar levels between Kong
      Mong Tha and Mae Sod, suggesting that the extent of MOI and clinical
      manifestations of malaria are not strongly associated with genetic diversity.
      Additionally, we did not detect significant genetic differentiation between the
      two parasite populations, as estimated by the Wright's fixation index of
      inter-population variance in allele frequencies, suggesting that gene flow
      prevented the formation of population structuring. Thus, this study highlights
      unique features of P. falciparum populations in Thailand. The implications of
      these finding are discussed.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of fixed dose artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of
      acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kampong Speu, Cambodia.
PG  - 343
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-343 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cambodia stopped using co-blistered, non-fixed, artesunate-mefloquine
      (ASMQ) in 2008 when treatment failure rates approximated 20%. Fixed dose
      combination (FDC) ASMQ is efficacious against acute uncomplicated, drug resistant
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia but has not been tested in
      Cambodia. METHODS: A 42-day WHO therapeutic efficacy study (TES) was conducted in
      2010 in Oral, Kampong Speu province, south-west Cambodia, in patients with acute 
      uncomplicated P. falciparum. Daily administered FDC ASMQ for three days was dosed
      by age. Genotyping of isolates at day 0 and day of recrudescence by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) classified post-treatment recurrent falciparum parasitaemia.
      Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing ([3H] hypoxanthine method) was performed on
      baseline parasites and reported as the drug concentration inhibiting 50% parasite
      growth vs no drug (IC(5)(0)). RESULTS: Recruited patients numbered 45; five aged 
      <15 years. On day 3, five of 45 [11.1 (3.7-24.05)] % patients were still
      parasite-positive; one of whom later failed treatment on day 21. There were 5/45 
      (11.1%) late treatment failures on day 21, 28 and 35; all were PCR diagnosed
      recrudescent infections. The day 0 MQ IC(5)(0)s ranged from 11.5-238.9 (median
      58.6) nM. CONCLUSIONS: This TES demonstrated reasonable efficacy in an area of
      possible reduced artemisinin sensitivity and high MQ IC(5)(0)s. Efficacy testing 
      of FDC ASMQ should continue in Cambodia and be considered for reintroduction if
      efficacy returns.

AB  - Ethiopia changed the first-line anti-malarial drug for uncomplicated Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to Coartem((R)) in 2004
      following nation-wide assessment of the efficacy of both drugs in 2003. This
      study was conducted to assess the prevalence of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      resistance-associated mutations in dhfr and dhps genes of P. falciparum three
      years after SP withdrawal in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 165 blood 
      spot samples were collected from patients infected with P. falciparum in Bahir
      Dar Health Center in 2005 (n=78) and 2008 (n=87) using Whatman (3M) filter
      papers. The three dhfr codons (dhfr108, dhfr 51 and dhfr 59) and the two dhps
      codons (dhfr 437 and 540) which are believed to determine SP resistance were
      detected by using nested PCR-based dot blot-hybridization technique. In dhfr,
      only the dhfr59Arg mutant-type showed statistically significant reduction from
      80.3% in 2005 to 56.4% in 2008 (p<0.01) with a significant increase of the wild
      type dhfr59Cys haplotypes from 4.9% in 2005 to 29.5% in 2008 (p<0.01). The double
      mutants dhfr108Asn/51Ile were detected at rate of 98.4% in 2005 and 98.7% in
      2008. A significant decrease in the triple dhfr (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg) mutation was
      observed from 2005 (78.6%) to 2008(56.4%) (p<0.01). The quadruple mutations of
      dhfr (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg)/dhps437Gly were significantly declined from 78.6% in
      2005 to 53.8% in 2008 (p<0.01) while quintuple mutations (dhfr
      (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg)/dhps437Gly/dhps540Glu) showed a reduction from 60.6% to
      37.2% after three years (p<0.01). In conclusion, the decline in the prevalence of
      dhfr/dhps combination mutations might indicate the re-emergence of sensitive
      parasites in the population following SP withdrawal. Therefore, further
      monitoring and assessment is important to determine the feasibility of
      re-introduction of SP alone or in combination as a more affordable and safer drug
      in the future in Ethiopia.

      Colombia.
PG  - 341
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-341 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of pregnancy-associated malaria is increasingly being
      documented in American countries. In Colombia, with higher frequency of
      Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum infection, recent reports confirmed
      gestational malaria as a serious public health problem. Thick smear examination
      is the gold standard to diagnose malaria in endemic settings, but in recent
      years, molecular diagnostic methods have contributed to elucidate the dimension
      of the problem of gestational malaria. The study was aimed at exploring the
      prevalence of gestational, placental and congenital malaria in women who
      delivered at the local hospitals of north-west Colombia, between June 2008 and
      April 2011. METHODS: A group of 129 parturient women was selected to explore the 
      prevalence of gestational, placental and congenital malaria in a descriptive,
      prospective and transversal (prevalence) design. Diagnosis was based on the
      simultaneous application of two independent diagnostic tests: microscopy of thick
      blood smears and a polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR). RESULTS: The prevalence
      of gestational malaria (thick smear /PCR) was 9.1%/14.0%; placental malaria was
      3.3%/16.5% and congenital malaria was absent. A history of gestational malaria
      during the current pregnancy was significantly associated with gestational
      malaria at delivery. Plasmodium vivax caused 65% of cases of gestational malaria,
      whereas P. falciparum caused most cases of placental malaria. CONCLUSIONS:
      Gestational and placental malaria are a serious problem in the region, but the
      risk of congenital malaria is low. A history of malaria during pregnancy may be a
      practical indicator of infection at delivery.

TI  - Assessing malaria transmission in a low endemicity area of north-western Peru.
PG  - 339
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-339 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Where malaria endemicity is low, control programmes need increasingly
      sensitive tools for monitoring malaria transmission intensity (MTI) and to better
      define health priorities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a low
      endemicity area of the Peruvian north-western coast to assess the MTI using both 
      molecular and serological tools. METHODS: Epidemiological, parasitological and
      serological data were collected from 2,667 individuals in three settlements of
      Bellavista district, in May 2010. Parasite infection was detected using
      microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibodies to Plasmodium vivax
      merozoite surface protein-119 (PvMSP1(1)(9)) and to Plasmodium falciparum
      glutamate-rich protein (PfGLURP) were detected by ELISA. Risk factors for
      exposure to malaria (seropositivity) were assessed by multivariate survey
      logistic regression models. Age-specific antibody prevalence of both P.
      falciparum and P. vivax were analysed using a previously published catalytic
      conversion model based on maximum likelihood for generating seroconversion rates 
      (SCR). RESULTS: The overall parasite prevalence by microscopy and PCR were
      extremely low: 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively for P. vivax, and 0 and 0.04%,
      respectively for P. falciparum, while seroprevalence was much higher, 13.6% for
      P. vivax and 9.8% for P. falciparum. Settlement, age and occupation as moto-taxi 
      driver during previous year were significantly associated with P. falciparum
      exposure, while age and distance to the water drain were associated with P. vivax
      exposure. Likelihood ratio tests supported age seroprevalence curves with two SCR
      for both P. vivax and P. falciparum indicating significant changes in the MTI
      over time. The SCR for PfGLURP was 19-fold lower after 2002 as compared to before
      (lambda1 = 0.022 versus lambda2 = 0.431), and the SCR for PvMSP1(1)(9) was
      four-fold higher after 2006 as compared to before (lambda1 = 0.024 versus lambda2
      = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Combining molecular and serological tools considerably
      enhanced the capacity of detecting current and past exposure to malaria
      infections and related risks factors in this very low endemicity area. This
      allowed for an improved characterization of the current human reservoir of
      infections, largely hidden and heterogeneous, as well as providing insights into 
      recent changes in species specific MTIs. This approach will be of key importance 
      for evaluating and monitoring future malaria elimination strategies.

TI  - Malarial parasite diversity in chimpanzees: the value of comparative approaches
      to ascertain the evolution of Plasmodium falciparum antigens.
PG  - 328
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum shares its most recent common ancestor with
      parasites found in African apes; these species constitute the so-called Laverania
      clade. In this investigation, the evolutionary history of Plasmodium lineages
      found in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) was explored. METHODS: Here, the
      remainders of 74 blood samples collected as part of the chimpanzees' routine
      health examinations were studied. For all positive samples with parasite lineages
      belonging to the Laverania clade, the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), the 
      gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts), the
      chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), the circumsporozoite protein (csp),
      merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2), and the DBL-1 domain from var2CSA were
      amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Other Plasmodium species were included in the
      mtDNA, dhfr-ts, and csp analyses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary genetic analyses 
      were performed, including molecular clock analyses on the mtDNA.
      RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Nine chimpanzees were malaria positive (12.2%); four of
      those infections were identified as P. falciparum, two as a Plasmodium
      reichenowi-like parasite or Plasmodium sp., one as Plasmodium gaboni, and two as 
      Plasmodium malariae. All P. falciparum isolates were resistant to chloroquine
      indicating that the chimpanzees acquired such infections from humans in recent
      times. Such findings, however, are not sufficient for implicating chimpanzees as 
      an animal reservoir for P. falciparum.Timing estimates support that the Laverania
      clade has co-existed with hominids for a long-period of time. The proposed
      species P. gaboni, Plasmodium billbrayi, and Plasmodium billcollinsi are
      monophyletic groups supporting that they are indeed different species.An expanded
      CSP phylogeny is presented, including all the Laverania species and other
      malarial parasites. Contrasting with other Plasmodium, the Laverania csp exhibits
      great conservation at the central tandem repeat region. Msp2 and var2CSA,
      however, show extended recent polymorphism in P. falciparum that likely
      originated after the P. reichenowi-P. falciparum split. The accumulation of such 
      diversity may indicate adaptation to the human host. These examples support the
      notion that comparative approaches among P. falciparum and its related species
      will be of great value in understanding the evolution of proteins that are
      important in parasite invasion of the human red blood cell, as well as those
      involved in malaria pathogenesis.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0072912 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed if histidine-rich-protein-2 (HRP2) based rapid diagnostic
      test (RDT) remains an efficient tool for Plasmodium falciparum case detection
      among fever patients in Zanzibar and if primary health care workers continue to
      adhere to RDT results in the new epidemiological context of low malaria
      transmission. Further, we evaluated the performance of RDT within the newly
      adopted integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) algorithm in Zanzibar. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 3890 patients aged >/= 2 months with
      uncomplicated febrile illness in this health facility based observational study
      conducted in 12 primary health care facilities in Zanzibar, between May-July
      2010. One patient had an inconclusive RDT result. Overall 121/3889 (3.1%)
      patients were RDT positive. The highest RDT positivity rate, 32/528 (6.1%), was
      found in children aged 5-14 years. RDT sensitivity and specificity against PCR
      was 76.5% (95% CI 69.0-83.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.7-100%), and against blood
      smear microscopy 78.6% (95% CI 70.8-85.1%) and 99.7% (95% CI 99.6-99.9%),
      respectively. All RDT positive, but only 3/3768 RDT negative patients received
      anti-malarial treatment. Adherence to RDT results was thus 3887/3889 (99.9%). RDT
      performed well in the IMCI algorithm with equally high adherence among children
      <5 years as compared with other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of HRP-2
      based RDT in the hands of health care workers compared with both PCR and
      microscopy for P. falciparum case detection was relatively low, whereas adherence
      to test results with anti-malarial treatment was excellent. Moreover, the results
      provide evidence that RDT can be reliably integrated in IMCI as a tool for
      improved childhood fever management. However, the relatively low RDT sensitivity 
      highlights the need for improved quality control of RDT use in primary health
      care facilities, but also for more sensitive point-of-care malaria diagnostic
      tools in the new epidemiological context of low malaria transmission in Zanzibar.

      falciparum in Anopheles gambiae.
PG  - e72130
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0072130 [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Anopheles gambiae uses its innate immune system to control bacterial
      and Plasmodium infection of its midgut tissue. The activation of potent IMD
      pathway-mediated anti-Plasmodium falciparum defenses is dependent on the presence
      of the midgut microbiota, which activate this defense system upon parasite
      infection through a peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRPLC. We employed
      transcriptomic and reverse genetic analyses to compare the P. falciparum
      infection-responsive transcriptomes of septic and aseptic mosquitoes and to
      determine whether bacteria-independent anti-Plasmodium defenses exist. Antibiotic
      treated aseptic mosquitoes mounted molecular immune responses representing a
      variety of immune functions upon P. falciparum infection. Among other immune
      factors, our analysis uncovered a serine protease inhibitor (SRPN7) and
      Clip-domain serine protease (CLIPC2) that were transcriptionally induced in the
      midgut upon P. falciparum infection, independent of bacteria. We also showed that
      SRPN7 negatively and CLIPC2 positively regulate the anti-Plasmodium defense,
      independently of the midgut-associated bacteria. Co-silencing assays suggested
      that these two genes may function together in a signaling cascade. Neither gene
      was regulated, nor modulated, by infection with the rodent malaria parasite
      Plasmodium berghei, suggesting that SRPN7 and CLIPC2 are components of a defense 
      system with preferential activity towards P. falciparum. Further analysis using
      RNA interference determined that these genes do not regulate the anti-Plasmodium 
      defense mediated by the IMD pathway, and both factors act as agonists of the
      endogenous midgut microbiota, further demonstrating the lack of functional
      relatedness between these genes and the bacteria-dependent activation of the IMD 
      pathway. This is the first study confirming the existence of a
      bacteria-independent, anti-P. falciparum defense. Further exploration of this
      anti-Plasmodium defense will help clarify determinants of immune specificity in
      the mosquito, and expose potential gene and/or protein targets for malaria
      intervention strategies based on targeting the parasite in the mosquito vector.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Plasmodium falciparum infections, proinflammatory cytokine
      response is implicated in control of parasite multiplication as well as in
      disease pathogenesis. However, the regulation of proinflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and its relation to disease severity remains
      poorly understood. METHODS: We examined cytokines gene expression by quantitative
      real time-PCR technique in a case control study comprising of P. falciparum
      infected (n=58) and non infected (n=30) groups. P. falciparum infected were
      further stratified as complicated and uncomplicated as per WHO criterion and
      parasitaemia levels. RESULTS: Higher expression of IL-2, IL-12alpha and TGF-beta 
      with decreased levels of IL-10 was seen in P. falciparum positivity. Complicated 
      malaria was associated with enhanced expression of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta but
      lower IL-2 and IL-12alpha in comparison to uncomplicated malaria. Modeling of
      data suggested higher expression of IL-12alpha to be predictive of uncomplicated 
      malaria [Odds ratio=3.074, 95% CI (1.254-7.536)] and was negatively associated
      with complicated malaria outcome (p=0.014). Interestingly, the probability of
      complicated malaria in males with elevated TNF-alpha expression was three times
      higher [p=0.05; Odds ratio=3.412, 95% CI (0.98-11.848)]. Age was also seen to be 
      a factor with higher IL-8 in diseased young (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: Our data
      suggested induction of balanced cytokine response in uncomplicated malaria while 
      cytokine dysregulation with a role for TGF-beta was indicated in complicated
      malaria. TH cells did not appear to be the source of increased IFN-gamma
      expression associated with malaria severity.

AB  - We describe development of an absolute multiplex quantitative real-time PCR for
      detection of Plasmodium spp., P. falciparum and P. vivax targets in order to
      produce an assay amenable to high throughput but with reduced costs. Important
      qPCR experimental details and information that is critical to performance and
      reliability of assay results were investigated. Inhibition studies were performed
      to test and compare co-purification of PCR inhibitors in samples extracted from
      whole blood using either the manual or automated methods. To establish the most
      optimal qPCR reaction volume, volume titration of the reaction master mix was
      performed starting at 10 microl to 1 microl reaction master mix with 1 microl of 
      template DNA in each reaction. As the reaction volume decreased, qPCR assays
      became more efficient with 1 microl reaction master mix being the most efficient.
      For more accurate quantification of parasites in a sample, we developed plasmid
      DNAs for all the three assay targets for absolute quantification. All of absolute
      qPCR assays performed with efficiency of more than 94%, R(2) values greater than 
      0.99 and the STDEV of each replicate was <0.167. Linear regression plots
      generated from absolute qPCR assays were used to estimate the corresponding
      parasite density from relative qPCR in terms of parasite/microl. One copy of
      plasmid DNA was established to be equivalent to 0.1 parasite/microl for
      Plasmodium spp. assay, 0.281 parasites for P. falciparum assay and 0.127
      parasite/microl for P. vivax assay. This study demonstrates for the first time
      use of plasmid DNA in absolute quantification of malaria parasite. The use of
      plasmid DNA standard in quantification of malaria parasite will be critical as
      efforts are underway to harmonize molecular assays used in diagnosis of malaria.

TI  - Prevalence and patterns of antifolate and chloroquine drug resistance markers in 
      Plasmodium vivax across Pakistan.
PG  - 310
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria species in Pakistan,
      with a distribution that coincides with Plasmodium falciparum in many parts of
      the country. Both species are likely exposed to drug pressure from a number of
      anti-malarials including chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and
      artemisinin combination therapy, yet little is known regarding the effects of
      drug pressure on parasite genes associated with drug resistance. The aims of this
      study were to determine the prevalence of polymorphisms in the SP
      resistance-associated genes pvdhfr, pvdhps and chloroquine resistance-associated 
      gene pvmdr1 in P. vivax isolates collected from across the country. METHODS: In
      2011, 801 microscopically confirmed malaria-parasite positive filter paper blood 
      samples were collected at 14 sites representing four provinces and the capital
      city of Islamabad. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
      identify human Plasmodium species infection. PCR-positive P. vivax isolates were 
      subjected to sequencing of pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvmdr1 and to real-time PCR
      analysis to assess pvmdr1 copy number variation. RESULTS: Of the 801 samples, 536
      were determined to be P. vivax, 128 were P. falciparum, 43 were mixed
      vivax/falciparum infections and 94 were PCR-negative for Plasmodium infection. Of
      PCR-positive P. vivax samples, 372 were selected for sequence analysis.
      Seventy-six of the isolates (23%) were double mutant at positions S58R and S117N 
      in pvdhfr. Additionally, two mutations at positions N50I and S93H were observed
      in 55 (15%) and 24 (7%) of samples, respectively. Three 18 base pair
      insertion-deletions (indels) were observed in pvdhfr, with two insertions at
      different nucleotide positions in 36 isolates and deletions in 10. Ninety-two
      percent of samples contained the pvdhps (S382/A383G/K512/A553/V585) SAKAV wild
      type haplotype. For pvmdr1, all isolates were wild type at position Y976F and 335
      (98%) carried the mutation at codon F1076L. All isolates harboured single copies 
      of the pvmdr1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mutations associated with SP
      resistance in P. vivax is low in Pakistan. The high prevalence of P. vivax mutant
      pvmdr1 codon F1076L indicates that efficacy of chloroquine plus primaquine could 
      be in danger of being compromised, but further studies are required to assess the
      clinical relevance of this observation. These findings will serve as a baseline
      for further monitoring of drug-resistant P. vivax malaria in Pakistan.

AB  - Repeated incubation of Plasmodium falciparum culture in 0.015% saponin solution
      for a total of 35 min destroys most of the uninfected cells, leaving only the
      ring-infected erythrocytes (RIEs). Parasites concentrated by this method can
      subsequently complete the asexual cycle and infect other erythrocytes. It is
      possible that resistance to saponin is mediated by one or more of the numerous
      parasite proteins present in the host erythrocyte membrane. We have found that
      schizonts are as susceptible as uninfected erythrocytes to saponin, indicating
      that the protective protein is parasite stage specific. Studies with cultured
      parasites have shown that ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA)
      strengthens host erythrocyte membrane and protects against destruction.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that RESA could be involved in resistance to saponin.
      Here, we have carried out PCR test on RESA gene, using three different primers.
      One of them showed that P. falciparum isolates collected directly from infected
      humans and cultured only for a few days, or not at all, have amplicon sizes
      ranging from 372 to 510 bp. However, the amplicon size changed to 873 bp when in 
      vitro growth was continued for one or more weeks. This genetic transformation
      precedes acquisition of the ability to confer saponin resistance to RIEs.

AB  - The geographical distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the
      mitochondrial genome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was
      investigated. We identified 88 SNPs in 516 isolates from seven parasite
      populations in Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Analysis of the SNPs
      postulated a sub-Saharan African origin and recovered a strong negative
      correlation between within-population SNP diversity and geographic distance from 
      the putative African origin over Southeast Asia and Oceania. These results are
      consistent with those previously obtained for nuclear genome-encoded housekeeping
      genes, indicating that the pattern of inheritance does not substantially affect
      the geographical distribution of SNPs.

AB  - Antimalarial drugs have usually been first deployed in areas of malaria
      endemicity at doses which were too low, particularly for high-risk groups such as
      young children and pregnant women. This may accelerate the emergence and spread
      of resistance, thereby shortening the useful life of the drug, but it is an
      inevitable consequence of the current imprecise method of dose finding. An
      alternative approach to dose finding is suggested in which phase 2 studies
      concentrate initially on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characterization
      and in vivo calibration of in vitro susceptibility information. PD assessment is 
      facilitated in malaria because serial parasite densities are readily assessed by 
      microscopy, and at low densities by quantitative PCR, so that initial therapeutic
      responses can be quantitated accurately. If the in vivo MIC could be
      characterized early in phase 2 studies, it would provide a sound basis for the
      choice of dose in all target populations in subsequent combination treatments.
      Population PK assessments in phase 2b and phase 3 studies which characterize PK
      differences between different age groups, clinical disease states, and human
      populations can then be combined with the PK-PD observations to provide a sound
      evidence base for dose recommendations in different target groups.

TI  - First report of detection and molecular confirmation of Plasmodium ovale from
      severe malaria cases in central India.

LID - 10.1111/tmi.12184 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report for the first-time detection of Plasmodium ovale in central 
      India. METHODS: From 2010, all hospitalised suspected malaria cases at the
      malaria clinic of the Regional Medical Research Centre for Tribals in Bastar
      district, central India, were screened. Plasmodium species were identified by
      microscopy and species-specific nested PCR of 18s rRNA. RESULTS: Of 256 enrolled 
      cases of confirmed P. falciparum malaria by microscopy, P. ovale infection was
      detected in three cases (1.2%) by PCR and sequencing. Of these three cases, one
      had cerebral malaria and another had severe malaria anaemia. In both of these
      cases, P. ovale infection was mixed with P. falciparum, while in third case the
      infection was mixed with both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Phylogenetic analysis
      revealed that these isolates showed closed homology with West African genotypes. 
      CONCLUSION: All three hospitalised patients were originally residents of remote
      inaccessible forest villages and never moved out of their residence. This finding
      also has implications in malaria control and elimination as P. ovale causes
      relapses. This study highlights the need of molecular diagnosis of malaria
      species for appropriate treatment and control.

TI  - Glucocorticosteroids in nano-sterically stabilized liposomes are efficacious for 
      elimination of the acute symptoms of experimental cerebral malaria.
PG  - e72722
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0072722 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral malaria is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum
      infection, and a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in
      malaria-endemic areas. We report high therapeutic efficacy of a novel formulation
      of liposome-encapsulated water-soluble glucocorticoid prodrugs, and in particular
      beta-methasone hemisuccinate (BMS), for treatment of experimental cerebral
      malaria (ECM), using the murine P. berghei ANKA model. BMS is a novel derivative 
      of the potent steroid beta-methasone, and was specially synthesized to enable
      remote loading into nano-sterically stabilized liposomes (nSSL), to form
      nSSL-BMS. The novel nano-drug, composed of nSSL remote loaded with BMS,
      dramatically improves drug efficacy and abolishes the high toxicity seen upon
      administration of free BMS. nSSL-BMS reduces ECM rates in a dose-dependent manner
      and creates a survival time-window, enabling administration of an antiplasmodial 
      drug, such as artemisone. Administration of artemisone after treatment with the
      nSSL-BMS results in complete cure. Treatment with BMS leads to lower levels of
      cerebral inflammation, demonstrated by changes in cytokines, chemokines, and cell
      markers, as well as diminished hemorrhage and edema, correlating with reduced
      clinical score. Administration of the liposomal formulation results in
      accumulation of BMS in the brains of sick mice but not of healthy mice. This
      steroidal nano-drug effectively eliminates the adverse effects of the cerebral
      syndrome even when the treatment is started at late stages of disease, in which
      disruption of the blood-brain barrier has occurred and mice show clear signs of
      neurological impairment. Overall, sequential treatment with nSSL-BMS and
      artemisone may be an efficacious and well-tolerated therapy for prevention of CM,
      elimination of parasites, and prevention of long-term cognitive damage.

TI  - A comprehensive survey of polymorphisms conferring anti-malarial resistance in
      Plasmodium falciparum across Pakistan.
PG  - 300
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have been conducted in Pakistan to determine the efficacy
      of chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which remain in use as
      treatment for Plasmodium vivax and in combination with artesunate to treat
      Plasmodium falciparum, respectively. In this study, samples from several sites
      across Pakistan were characterized to determine prevalence of molecular
      resistance markers in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter
      (pfcrt), multidrug resistance (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and
      dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes and the origin of chloroquine-resistant
      P. falciparum parasites. METHODS: Microscopy-confirmed malaria parasite-positive 
      blood samples from 801 patients across the country were collected in 2011. Of
      these, 171 infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as P.
      falciparum and analysed by pyrosequencing for mutations conferring chloroquine
      resistance (pfcrt codons 72-76), multidrug resistance (pfmdr1 N86Y, Y184F,
      S1034C, N1042D and D1246Y), pyrimethamine resistance (pfdhfr, C50R, N51I, C59R,
      S108N and I164L) and sulphadoxine resistance (pfdhps, S436A, A437G, K540E, A581G 
      and A613T/S). pfmdr1 gene copy number variation was determined by real-time PCR, 
      and microsatellites flanking the pfcrt locus were typed to determine the origin
      of the chloroquine-resistant haplotype. RESULTS: The pfcrt K76T mutation was
      found in all samples as part of the S72/V73/M74/N75/T76 (SVMNT) haplotype.
      Microsatellites flanking pfcrt showed high similarity to the signature found in
      India and Papua New Guinea. pfmdr1 N86Y was found in 20% of samples and all
      samples harboured a single copy of the pfmdr1 gene. The pfdhfr double mutation
      C59R + S108N was present in 87% of samples while the pfdhfr triple mutant (N51I +
      C59R + S108N) was not detected. Pfdhps A437G was found in 60% of samples. Pure
      pfdhps K540E was rare, at 4%, but mixed genotype 540 K/E was found in 77% of
      samples. Similarly, pure pfdhps A581G was found in 4% of the isolates while mixed
      581A/G was found in 39% of samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an
      emerging problem with multidrug resistant P. falciparum in Pakistan. The
      chloroquine resistance genotype has reached complete fixation in the population, 
      with a microsatellite pattern indicative of a selective sweep. Moreover, the
      prevalence of mutations in both pfdhfr and pfdhps, albeit without the presence of
      the pfdhfr triple mutant, indicates that continued monitoring is warranted to
      assess whether SP remains efficacious as a partner drug for artesunate for the
      treatment of P. falciparum.

PG  - 297
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are prevalent in
      Pakistan, yet up-to-date data on the epidemiology of malaria in Pakistan are not 
      available. This study was undertaken to determine the current prevalence and
      distribution of Plasmodium species across the country. METHODS: A malariometric
      population survey was conducted in 2011 using blood samples collected from 801
      febrile patients of all ages in four provinces and the capital city of Islamabad.
      Microscopically confirmed Plasmodium-positive blood samples were reconfirmed by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Confirmed parasite-positive samples were
      subjected to species-specific PCR capable of detecting four species of human
      malaria. RESULTS: Of the 707 PCR-positive samples, 128 (18%) were P. falciparum, 
      536 (76%) were P. vivax, and 43 (6%) were mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax.
      Ninety-four microscopy-positive samples were PCR-negative, and Plasmodium
      malariae and Plasmodium ovale were not detected. Prevalence of P. vivax ranged
      from 2.4% in Punjab Province to 10.8% in Sindh Province and prevalence of P.
      falciparum ranged from 0.1% in Islamabad to 3.8% in Balochistan. CONCLUSIONS:
      Plasmodium infections in Pakistan are largely attributed to P. vivax but P.
      falciparum and mixed species infections are also prevalent. In addition, regional
      variation in the prevalence and species composition of malaria is high.

TI  - Breadth of anti-merozoite antibody responses is associated with the genetic
      diversity of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections and protection against
      clinical malaria.
PG  - 1409-16
LID - 10.1093/cid/cit556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elucidating the mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity to
      Plasmodium falciparum infections would be highly valuable for malaria vaccine
      development. Asymptomatic multiclonal infections have been shown to predict
      protection from clinical malaria in a transmission-dependent manner, but the
      mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We assessed the breadth of antibody
      responses to several vaccine candidate merozoite antigens in relation to the
      infecting parasite population and clinical immunity. METHODS: In a cohort study
      in Tanzania, 320 children aged 1-16 years who were asymptomatic at baseline were 
      included. We genotyped P. falciparum infections by targeting the msp2 gene using 
      polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis and measured antibodies
      to 7 merozoite antigens using a multiplex assay. We assessed the correlation
      between the number of clones and the breadth of the antibody response, and
      examined their effects on the risk of malaria during 40 weeks of follow-up using 
      age-adjusted multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The antibody breadth was
      positively correlated with the number of clones (RR [risk ratio], 1.63; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.02). Multiclonal infections were associated with
      a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of malaria in the absence of antibodies
      (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, .29-2.34). The breadth of the antibody response was
      significantly associated with a reduced risk of malaria in the absence of
      infections (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, .09-.66). In combination, these factors were
      associated with a lower risk of malaria than they were individually (RR, 0.14;
      95% CI, .04-.48). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that malaria vaccines mimicking
      naturally acquired immunity should ideally induce antibody responses that can be 
      boosted by natural infections.

TI  - Identification of piggyBac-mediated insertions in Plasmodium berghei by next
      generation sequencing.
PG  - 287
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The piggyBac transposon system provides a powerful forward genetics
      tool to study gene function in Plasmodium parasites via random insertion
      mutagenesis and phenotypic screening. The identification of genotype of piggyBac 
      mutants in the Plasmodium genome is thus an indispensable step in forward genetic
      analysis. Several PCR-based approaches have been used to identify the piggyBac
      insertion sites in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei, but all are
      tedious and inefficient. Next generation sequencing can produce large amounts of 
      sequence data and is particularly suitable for genome-wide association studies.
      In this study, the Next generation sequencing technology was employed to
      efficiently identify piggyBac insertion sites in the genome of P. berghei.
      METHODS: Plasmodium berghei parasites were co-transfected with piggyBac donor and
      helper plasmids. Initially, the classical inverse PCR method was used to identify
      the existence of piggyBac insertions in the P. berghei genome. The whole genome
      of post-transfection parasites was subsequently sequenced with a PCR-free
      paired-end module using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system. The two distinct
      methods ('BLAST method' and 'SOAP method') were employed to identify piggyBac
      insertion sites in the P. berghei genome with Illumina sequencing data. All the
      identified piggyBac insertions were further tested by half-nested PCR. RESULTS:
      The inverse PCR method resulted in a very low yield of ten individual insertions 
      identified. Conversely, 47 piggyBac insertions were identified from about 1 Gb of
      Illumina sequencing data via the two distinct analysis methods. The majority of
      identified piggyBac insertions were confirmed by half-nested PCR. In addition,
      1,850 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified through alignment of the
      Illumina sequencing data of the P. berghei ANKA strain used in this study with
      the reference genome sequences. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a
      high-throughput genome sequencing approach is an efficient tool for the
      identification of piggyBac-mediated insertions in Plasmodium parasites.

TI  - Residual Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in Kenyan children after
      artemisinin-combination therapy is associated with increased transmission to
      mosquitoes and parasite recurrence.
PG  - 2017-24
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parasite clearance time after artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT) may be increasing in Asian and African settings. The association between
      parasite clearance following ACT and transmissibility is currently unknown.
      METHODS: We determined parasite clearance dynamics by duplex quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in samples collected in the first 3 days after
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria with ACT. Gametocyte carriage was determined
      by Pfs25 quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assays;
      infectiousness to mosquitoes by membrane-feeding assays on day 7 after treatment.
      RESULTS: Residual parasitemia was detected by qPCR in 31.8% (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 24.6-39.8) of the children on day 3 after initiation of treatment.
      Residual parasitemia was associated with a 2-fold longer duration of gametocyte
      carriage (P = .0007), a higher likelihood of infecting mosquitoes (relative risk,
      1.95; 95% CI, 1.17-3.24; P = .015), and a higher parasite burden in mosquitoes
      (incidence rate ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.61-5.31; P < .001). Children with residual
      parasitemia were also significantly more likely to experience microscopically
      detectable parasitemia during follow-up (relative risk, 11.25; 95% CI,
      4.08-31.01; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Residual submicroscopic parasitemia is common
      after ACT and is associated with a higher transmission potential. Residual
      parasitemia may also have consequences for individual patients because of its
      higher risk of recurrent parasitemia.

TI  - Co-infection of human parvovirus B19 with Plasmodium falciparum contributes to
      malaria disease severity in Gabonese patients.
PG  - 375
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-13-375 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 (B19V) coinfection with
      Plasmodium falciparum has been previously reported. However, the impact of
      B19V-infection on the clinical course of malaria is still elusive. In this study,
      we investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of B19V co-infection in 
      Gabonese children with malaria. METHODS: B19V prevalence was analyzed in serum
      samples of 197 Gabonese children with P. falciparum malaria and 85 healthy
      controls using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA), and direct DNA-sequencing. RESULTS: B19V was detected in 29/282 (10.28%)
      of Gabonese children. B19V was observed more frequently in P. falciparum malaria 
      patients (14.21%) in comparison to healthy individuals (1.17%) (P<0.001).
      Notably, the mild-malaria group revealed significantly lower hematocrit levels in
      B19V/P. falciparum co-infection than in P. falciparum mono-infection (P<0.05).
      Genetic analysis revealed a predominance of B19V genotype-1 (71.43%) in the
      studied population. However, B19V-genotype 2 was observed significantly more
      often in children with severe-malaria than in mild-malaria (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: 
      Our findings reveal that B19V-infection is frequent in Gabonese children with P. 
      falciparum malaria and signifies a possible contribution of B19V on the clinical 
      course of malaria in a genotype-dependent manner. B19V co-infection should be
      considered as a additional diagnostic measure in malaria patients with life
      threatening anemia.

TI  - Performance of microscopy and RDTs in the context of a malaria prevalence survey 
      in Angola: a comparison using PCR as the gold standard.
PG  - 284
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of Plasmodium infections in community surveys
      is essential to successful malaria control. Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests
      (RDTs) are the main techniques used to diagnose malaria in field-based surveys.
      While microscopy is still considered the gold standard, RDTs are growing in
      popularity as they allow for rapid and inexpensive diagnosis. Using data from a
      prevalence survey conducted in north-western Angola in 2010, the authors aimed to
      compare the performance of microscopy and RDTs in identifying Plasmodium
      falciparum infections, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the gold
      standard. METHODS: Results from 3,307 subjects (1,225 preschool-aged children
      (zero to five year olds), 1,134 school-aged children (six to 15 year olds) and
      948 mothers/caregivers (>15 years of age)), tested for P. falciparum infections, 
      were utilized. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive
      values (PPV and NPV) of microscopy and Paracheck-Pf(R) were compared using the
      McNemar's test and the weighted generalized score Chi-squared test for paired
      data. RESULTS: The prevalence of P. falciparum infections determined by PCR and
      microscopy was 15.9% and by Paracheck- Pf(R) was 16.3%. Compared to microscopy,
      Paracheck-Pf(R) had significantly higher sensitivity (72.8% versus 60%),
      specificity (94.3% versus 92.5%), PPV (70.7% versus 60%) and NPV (94.8% versus
      92.5%). Both tests had significantly lower sensitivity in mothers (36.8% for
      microscopy and 43.7% for Paracheck-Pf(R)) than in their children (68.4% in zero
      to five years-old and 60.6% in six to 15 years-old for microscopy and 80.4% in
      zero to five year-olds and 76.5% in six to 15 year-olds for Paracheck-Pf(R)).
      CONCLUSION: Both microscopy and RDTs performed suboptimally when compared to PCR.
      False negativity could be associated with the low parasite density profile of the
      samples. False positivity may be related to the well-described limitations of
      those techniques such as level of expertise of microscopists or persistent
      antigenicity from previous infections in the case of RDTs. Nevertheless, RDTs had
      enhanced performance comparatively to microscopy in detecting malaria infections,
      favouring their use in community cross-sectional malaria surveys, where expert
      performance of microscopy is hard to accomplish.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-283 [doi]
AB  - A case of Plasmodium knowlesi and HIV co-infection is reported in a German
      traveller returning from Thailand. The 54 year-old patient presented to the
      Institute of Tropical Medicine in Tubingen with a 11-day history of daily fever
      and chills. Initial microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears
      was suggestive of a mixed infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
      malariae. However, PCR amplification of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene revealed
      a P. knowlesi infection. Parasitaemia was 473 parasites/mul and the platelet
      count was within the normal range. Oral treatment with Malarone(R) was initiated 
      and resulted in a fast recovery without any complications. As part of routine
      screening the patient also underwent HIV testing and was found to be HIV positive
      with a CD4 cell count of 115/mul and a viral load of 34,799 copies/ml. A
      follow-up measurement of the viral load seven days after the first quantification
      revealed an increase to 102,000 copies/ml. Three months after the first
      quantification the viral load had dropped to 10,000 copies/ml without the
      initiation of antiretroviral treatment. This suggests the possibility of a P.
      knowlesi malaria-induced temporary elevation of viral load similar to that
      reported for P. falciparum and HIV co-infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of malaria-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is
      increasing due to its high sensitivity, speciation and quantification of malaria 
      parasites. However, due to the lack of consensus or standardized methods in
      performing qPCR, it is difficult to evaluate and/or compare the quality of work
      reported by different authors for a cross-study and/or cross-platform assay
      analysis. METHODS: The performances of seven published qPCR assays that detect
      Plasmodium spp or Plasmodium falciparum were compared using standard DNA and
      samples from a clinical trial. Amplification and qPCR measurements were performed
      using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. All the analyses
      were automatically established using the default settings. For the TaqMan probe
      format, the assays were performed in the background of QuantiFast Probe Master
      Mix whereas in SYBR Green format, the assays were performed in the background of 
      QuantiFast SYBR Green Master Mix and QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix background.
      RESULTS: Assays with high PCR efficiencies outperformed those with low
      efficiencies in all categories including sensitivity, precision and consistency
      regardless of the assay format and background. With the exception of one assay,
      all assays evaluated showed lower sensitivity compared to what have been
      published. When samples from a malaria challenge study were analysed, the qPCR
      assay with the overall best performance detected parasites in subjects earliest
      and with most consistency. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate the need for
      increased consensus and guidelines that will encourage better experimental
      practices, allowing more consistent and unambiguous interpretation of qPCR
      results.

TI  - Accuracy of HRP2 RDT (Malaria Antigen P.f(R)) compared to microscopy and PCR for 
      malaria diagnosis in Senegal.
PG  - 273-8
LID - 10.1179/2047773213Y.0000000102 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) allow for the confirmation of malaria diagnosis. In 
      Senegal, RDTs detecting HRP2 have been adopted in 2008 for malaria diagnosis.
      However, the sustainability of this strategy requires adequate and regular
      quality control. PCR on DNA extracted in nitrocellulose band of RDTs enable
      quality control. A RDT (Malaria Antigen P.f(R)) and a thick smear were performed 
      on patients with suspected malaria. DNA was extracted from the nitrocellulose
      band of RDTs to which a non-specific PCR and a specific PCR were applied. The
      results of the RDT were compared with those obtained from the thick smear and the
      PCR to measure sensitivity, specificity as well as positive and negative
      predictive values. For 81.6% of the 273 patients involved, the thick smear was
      positive. Rapid diagnosis tests were positive for 85.7% of the patients.
      Non-specific PCR was positive on 87.9% of RDTs. Plasmodium falciparum was found
      in 99.5% of patients and Plasmodium ovale appeared in only 0.4% of patients.
      Sensitivity of the Malaria Antigen Pf(R) RDT in relation to thick smear and to
      PCR was 98.2% and 97.1% respectively. Quality control with PCR on the
      nitrocellulose band performed several months after it was used confirms its
      adequate level of sensitivity. The collection and screening of DNA present in
      already used RDT is a good means of quality control for this tool. It is also a
      relevant alternative to the molecular approach in the context of a reduction in
      the transmission of malaria.

AB  - Senegal has since 2003 used sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for Intermittent
      Preventive Treatment (IPT) of malaria in risk groups. However, the large-scale
      IPT strategy may result in increasing drug resistance. Our study investigated the
      possible impact of SP-IPT given to infants and children on the prevalence of
      SP-resistant haplotypes in the Plasmodium falciparum genes Pfdhfr and Pfdhps,
      comparing sites with and without IPTi/c. P. falciparum positives samples (n=352) 
      were collected from children under 5years of age during two cross-sectional
      surveys in 2010 and 2011 in three health districts (two on IPTi/c and one without
      IPTi/c intervention) located in the southern part of Senegal. The prevalence of
      SP-resistance-related haplotypes in Pfdhfr and Pfdhps was determined by nested
      PCR followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP)-ELISA. The
      prevalence of the Pfdhfr double mutant haplotypes (CNRN and CICN) was stable
      between years at<10% in the control group (P=0.69), while it rose significantly
      in the IPTi/c group from 2% in 2010 to 20% in 2011 (P=0.008). The prevalence of
      the Pfdhfr triple mutant haplotype (CIRN) increased in both groups, but only
      significantly in the IPTi/c group from 41% to 65% in 2011 (P=0.005). Conversely, 
      the Pfdhps 437G mutation decreased in both groups from 44.6% to 28.6% (P=0.07)
      and from 66.7% to 47.5% (P=0.02) between 2010 and 2011 in the control and the
      IPTi/c groups, respectively. Combined with Pfdhfr, there was a weak trend for
      decreasing prevalence of quadruple mutants (triple Pfdhfr+Pfdhps 437G) in both
      groups (P=0.15 and P=0.34). During the two cross-sectional surveys, some
      significant changes were observed in the SP-resistance-related genes. However,
      since these changes were observed in the two groups, the IPTi/c strategy does
      only seem to have limited impact on resistance development and other factors as
      well. However, continuous monitoring will be needed, due to the up-scaling of the
      IPTi/c strategy in Senegal according to WHO recommendations.

      revealed by PlasmoNex.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian malaria parasite that is widespread
      in humans in Malaysian Borneo. However, little is known about the incidence and
      distribution of this parasite in the Sandakan division, Malaysian Borneo.
      Therefore, the aim of the present epidemiological study was to investigate the
      incidence and distribution of P. knowlesi as well as other Plasmodium species in 
      this division based on a most recent developed hexaplex PCR system (PlasmoNex).
      METHODS: A total of 189 whole blood samples were collected from Telupid Health
      Clinic, Sabah, Malaysia, from 2008 to 2011. All patients who participated in the 
      study were microscopically malaria positive before recruitment. Complete
      demographic details and haematological profiles were obtained from 85 patients
      (13 females and 72 males). Identification of Plasmodium species was conducted
      using PlasmoNex targeting the 18S ssu rRNA gene. RESULTS: A total of 178 samples 
      were positive for Plasmodium species by using PlasmoNex. Plasmodium falciparum
      was identified in 68 samples (38.2%) followed by 64 cases (36.0%) of Plasmodium
      vivax, 42 (23.6%) cases of P. knowlesi, two (1.1%) cases of Plasmodium malariae
      and two (1.1%) mixed-species infections (i e, P. vivax/P. falciparum).
      Thirty-five PlasmoNex positive P. knowlesi samples were misdiagnosed as P.
      malariae by microscopy. Plasmodium knowlesi was detected in all four districts of
      Sandakan division with the highest incidence in the Kinabatangan district.
      Thrombocytopaenia and anaemia showed to be the most frequent malaria-associated
      haematological complications in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of P.
      knowlesi in Sandakan division showed that prospective studies on the
      epidemiological risk factors and transmission dynamics of P. knowlesi in these
      areas are crucial in order to develop strategies for effective malaria control.
      The availability of advanced diagnostic tool PlasmoNex enhanced the accuracy and 
      accelerated the speed in the diagnosis of malaria.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the malaria morbidity and the frequencies
      of molecular markers of resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      in pregnant women at delivery in Mali. Two hundred pregnant women have been
      included at the delivery clinic in Fana. The age group of 14-19 years was
      predominant. Fifty two per cent (52.3%: 104/200) were malaria slides positive in 
      their peripheral blood and 15% (30/200) of the women carried parasite in their
      placenta. The prevalence rate of anemia was 44.5% (89/200). PCR technique was
      successfully performed on 16 paired samples. The frequency of the Pfcrt K76T
      mutants in Plasmodium falciparum infections in peripheral blood was 68.8% (11/16)
      and 100% (16/16) in the placenta (p = 0.004). The frequency in peripheral blood
      of the DHFR N51I mutation was 12.5% (2/16) and 18.8% (3/16) in the placenta
      (p=0.12). The frequencies of the DHPS A437G mutants were similar in both sites
      25% (4/16). No DHPS K540E and DHFR 164L mutations were found in the Fana
      pregnancy women samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Pakistan, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum co-exist and 
      usage of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) against P. falciparum exposes P. vivax
      to the drug leading to generation of resistant alleles. The main aim of this
      study was to investigate frequency distribution of drug resistance associated
      mutations in pvdhfr, pvdhps genes and provide baseline molecular epidemiological 
      data on SP-associated resistance in P. vivax from southern Pakistan. METHODS:
      From January 2008 to May 2009, a total of 150 samples were collected from
      patients tested slide-positive for P. vivax, at the Aga Khan University Hospital,
      Karachi, or its collection units located in Baluchistan and Sindh Province.
      Nested PCR using pvdhfr and pvdhps specific primers was performed for all
      samples.91.3% (137/150) of the samples were tested PCR positive of which 87.3%
      (131/137) were successfully sequenced. Sample sequencing data was analysed and
      compared against wild type reference sequences. RESULTS: In dhfr, mutations were 
      observed at codons F57L, S58R and S117N/T. Novel non-synonymous mutations were
      observed at codon positions N50I, G114R and E119K while a synonymous mutation was
      observed at codon position 69Y. In dhps, mutations were observed at codon
      position A383G and A553G while novel non-synonymous mutations were observed at
      codon positions S373T, E380K, P384L, N389T, V392D, T393P, D459A, M601I, A651D and
      A661V. CONCLUSION: This is the first report from southern Pakistan on SP
      resistance in clinical isolates of P. vivax. Results from this study confirm that
      diverse drug resistant alleles are circulating within this region.

TI  - Successful human infection with P. falciparum using three aseptic Anopheles
      stephensi mosquitoes: a new model for controlled human malaria infection.
PG  - e68969
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0068969 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is a powerful method for
      assessing the efficacy of anti-malaria vaccines and drugs targeting
      pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the parasite. CHMI has heretofore
      required the bites of 5 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-infected
      mosquitoes to reliably induce Pf malaria. We reported that CHMI using the bites
      of 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared aseptically in compliance with current good
      manufacturing practices (cGMP) was successful in 6 participants. Here, we report 
      results from a subsequent CHMI study using 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared
      aseptically to validate the initial clinical trial. We also compare results of
      safety, tolerability, and transmission dynamics in participants undergoing CHMI
      using 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared aseptically to published studies of CHMI
      using 5 mosquitoes. Nineteen adults aged 18-40 years were bitten by 3 Anopheles
      stephensi mosquitoes infected with the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 strain of Pf.
      All 19 participants developed malaria (100%); 12 of 19 (63%) on Day 11. The mean 
      pre-patent period was 258.3 hours (range 210.5-333.8). The geometric mean
      parasitemia at first diagnosis by microscopy was 9.5 parasites/microL (range
      2-44). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detected parasites an
      average of 79.8 hours (range 43.8-116.7) before microscopy. The mosquitoes had a 
      geometric mean of 37,894 PfSPZ/mosquito (range 3,500-152,200). Exposure to the
      bites of 3 aseptically-raised, PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes is a safe, effective
      procedure for CHMI in malaria-naive adults. The aseptic model should be
      considered as a new standard for CHMI trials in non-endemic areas. Microscopy is 
      the gold standard used for the diagnosis of Pf malaria after CHMI, but qPCR
      identifies parasites earlier. If qPCR continues to be shown to be highly
      specific, and can be made to be practical, rapid, and standardized, it should be 
      considered as an alternative for diagnosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00744133 NCT00744133.

TI  - Selection of pfdhfr/pfdhps alleles and declining
      artesunate/sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum
      eight years after deployment in eastern Sudan.
PG  - 255
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artesunate/sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS/SP) has been the first-line
      treatment for falciparum malaria in Sudan since 2004. The impact of this
      combination on anti-malarial resistance-associated molecular markers has not been
      investigated. In this study, an evaluation of the efficacy and prevalence of drug
      resistance alleles (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr and pfdhps) eight years after the
      adoption of AS/SP in eastern Sudan is reported. METHODS: A 28-day follow-up
      efficacy trial of AS/SP was conducted in eastern Sudan during the 2012
      transmission season. Blood smears were collected from patients on days 0, 1, 2,
      3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Blood spots on filter paper were obtained pre-treatment and 
      on the day the patient was parasite positive by microscopy. Genotyping of alleles
      was performed by qPCR (pfcrt 72-76 and pfmdr1 copy number) and direct sequencing 
      of pfmdr1, pfdhfr and pfdhps. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients out of 68 (93%)
      completed the 28-day follow-up, adequate clinical, and parasitological response
      occurred in 90.5% and 85.3% of the patients in the per-protocol and
      intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. PCR corrected per-protocol efficacy was
      93.7%. The enrolment prevalence of pfcrt-CVMNK was 30.2% and pfmdr1-N86 was
      40.3%. The pfmdr1 haplotype NFD occurred in 32.8% of pre-treatment samples and
      was significantly higher than previous reports (Fisher's exact p = 0.0001). The
      pfdhfr-51I/108N combination occurred in all sequenced isolates and 59R was
      observed in a single individual. pfdhps substitutions 436A, 437G, 540E, 581G and 
      613S were observed at 7.8, 77.3, 76.9%, 33.8% and 0.0%, respectively. Treatment
      failures were associated with the pfdhps haplotype SGEGA at these five codons (OR
      7.3; 95% CI 0.65 - 368; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: The decrease of CQR associated
      genotypes reflects the formal policy of complete removal of CQ in Sudan. However,
      the frequency of markers associated with SP failure is increasing in this study
      area and may be contributing to the treatment efficacy falling below 90%. Further
      monitoring of AS/SP efficacy and of post-treatment selection of pfdhfr and pfdhps
      alleles in vivo is required to inform future treatment guidelines.

TI  - A randomized trial of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
      in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria among children in western Kenya.
PG  - 254
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was adopted as first-line treatment for 
      uncomplicated malaria in Kenya in 2006. Monitoring drug efficacy at regular
      intervals is essential to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. The
      efficacy of AL and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) were evaluated for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children aged six to 59 months in western
      Kenya. METHODS: From October 2010 to August 2011, children with fever or history 
      of fever with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection were enrolled in
      an in vivo efficacy trial in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO)
      guidelines. The children were randomized to treatment with a three-day course of 
      AL or DP and efficacy outcomes were measured at 28 and 42 days after treatment
      initiation. RESULTS: A total of 137 children were enrolled in each treatment arm.
      There were no early treatment failures and all children except one had cleared
      parasites by day 3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-uncorrected adequate clinical
      and parasitological response rate (ACPR) was 61% in the AL arm and 83% in the DP 
      arm at day 28 (p = 0.001). PCR-corrected ACPR at day 28 was 97% in the AL group
      and 99% in the DP group, and it was 96% in both arms at day 42. CONCLUSIONS: AL
      and DP remain efficacious for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria among
      children in western Kenya. The longer half-life of piperaquine relative to
      lumefantrine may provide a prophylactic effect, accounting for the lower rate of 
      re-infection in the first 28 days after treatment in the DP arm.

TI  - A clinical and molecular study of artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in
      three districts of central and eastern India.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-247 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) is recommended
      throughout India as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria. Due to the presence of several eco-epidemiological zones of malaria and 
      variable drug pressure, it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this
      combination in different regions of India. The objective of this study was to use
      clinical and molecular methods to monitor the efficacy of AS + SP in three
      diverse sites. METHODS: The study was undertaken in three high endemic sites of
      central and eastern India. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were
      enrolled and followed for 28 days. Molecular genotyping was conducted for
      merozoite surface protein (msp1 and msp2) to differentiate between re-infection
      and recrudescence and for the dhfr and dhps genes to monitor antifolate drug
      resistance. RESULTS: In all, 149 patients were enrolled at the three sites. The
      crude cure rates were 95.9%, 100%, and 100% in Ranchi, Keonjhar, and West Garo
      Hills respectively. PCR-corrected cure rates were 100% at all sites. In dhfr, 27%
      of isolates had triple mutations, while 46% isolates were double-mutants. The
      most prevalent mutation was S108N followed by C59R. 164 L mutation was observed
      in 43/126 (34%) isolates. In dhps, most (76%) of the isolates were wild-type.
      Only 2.5% (2/80) isolates showed double mutation. dhfr-dhps two locus mutation
      were observed in 16% (13/80) isolates. Parasite clearance time was not related
      with antifolate mutations. CONCLUSIONS: AS + SP combination therapy remained
      effective against falciparum malaria despite common mutations promoting
      resistance to antifolate drugs. Although the prevalence of double and triple
      mutations in dhfr was high, the prevalence of dhfr-dhps two locus mutations were 
      low. Even isolates with dhfr triple and dhfr-dhps two locus mutations achieved
      adequate clinical and parasitological response.

TI  - Multiple Genotypes of the Commonly Co-Segregating Toll-Like Receptor 4 Asp299Gly 
      and Thr399Ile in Baluchi Malaria Patients from Iran.
PG  - 182-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Different studies have shown an association of TLR4 polymorphisms with
      susceptibility/resistance to malaria disease. In the current immunogenetic study,
      we assessed the TLR4 genotypes formed by the two common single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) in the co-segregate state in
      Baluchi Plasmodium falciparum infected and healthy populations from malaria
      hypoendemic areas of Iran. The study was performed to evaluate the distribution
      and correlation of TLR4 co-segregating genotypes in patients with mild malaria.
      Moreover, the frequency of these genotypes was compared with reported results
      from other populations in similar or contrasting malaria settings around the
      world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case control study, the presence of 2 SNPs 
      in the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) were analyzed in 350 Baluchi patients 
      with mild malaria and 350 unrelated healthy controls by using polymerase chain
      reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) techniques followed 
      by sequencing analysis. Differences in the TLR4 co-segregate genotype frequencies
      among the studied group were determined by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Although
      the distribution of the two commonly co-segregating TLR4 genotypes presented a
      diverse and distinct pattern in the Baluchi population, no significant difference
      was detected between the cases and controls (p>0.05). A lower frequency of TLR4
      Asp299Gly/Thr399Thr was observed in Baluchis with mild malaria compared to
      African populations (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Differences in the co-segregation
      patterns of TLR4 Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile genotypes in the Baluchi population compared
      to other malaria endemic populations may suggest different local evolutionary
      pressure on TLR4 polymorphisms by malaria in this region. The higher frequency of
      Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile genotypes among the Baluchi population compared with the
      African population (p< 0.05) which suffers from a larger number of severe cases
      might suggest that this genotype has a role in protecting against severe malaria.
      These findings are useful for further understanding the pathogenesis of severe
      malaria.

TI  - The suitability of P. falciparum merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 as genetic
      markers for in vivo drug trials in Yemen.
PG  - e67853
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067853 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of the conclusions from in vivo efficacy anti-malarial
      drug trials depends on distinguishing between recrudescences and re-infections
      which is accomplished by genotyping genes coding P. falciparum merozoite surface 
      1 (MSP1) and MSP2. However, the reliability of the PCR analysis depends on the
      genetic markers' allelic diversity and variant frequency. In this study the
      genetic diversity of the genes coding for MSP1 and MSP2 was obtained for P.
      falciparum parasites circulating in Yemen. METHODS: Blood samples were collected 
      from 511 patients with fever and screened for malaria parasites using
      Giemsa-stained blood films. A total 74 samples were infected with P. falciparum, 
      and the genetic diversity was assessed by nested PCR targeting Pfmsp1 (Block2)
      and Pfmsp2 (block 3). RESULTS: Overall, 58%, 28% and 54% of the isolates
      harboured parasites of the Pfmsp1 K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic families, and 55%
      and 89% harboured those of the Pfmsp2 FC27 and 3D7 allelic families,
      respectively. For both genetic makers, the multiplicity of the infection (MOI)
      was significantly higher in the isolates from the foothills/coastland areas as
      compared to those from the highland (P<0.05). Pfmsp2 had higher number of
      distinct allelic variants than Pfmsp1 (20 vs 11). The expected heterozygosity
      (HE) for Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 were 0.82 and 0.94, respectively. Nonetheless, a bias 
      in the frequency distribution of the Pfmsp1 allelic variants was noted from all
      areas, and of those of Pfmsp2 in the samples collected from the highland areas.
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the complexity and allelic diversity of
      Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 genes between areas probably reflect differences in the
      intensity of malaria transmission. The biased distribution of allelic variants
      suggests that in Yemen Pfmsp1 should not be used for PCR correction of in vivo
      clinical trials outcomes, and that caution should be exercised when employing
      Pfmsp2.

AB  - Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are becoming resistant to drugs
      including antifolates, sulphonamides and chloroquine. This study was focused at
      sequence analysis of resistant genes of these parasites against
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine, from Bannu, Pakistan. Known mutations
      were detected at codons 57, 58 and 117 of pvdhfr gene of P. vivax, while none of 
      the isolates had any pvdhps mutation. Similarly P. falciparum isolates exhibited 
      double 59R+108N mutations in pfdhfr, and single 437G in pfdhps thus demonstrating
      the existance of triple mutant 59R+108N+437G haplotype in this region. The key
      chloroquine resistance mutation, 76T in pfcrt was observed in 100% of the P.
      falciparum isolates, with haplotype SVMNT which is also associated with
      resistance to amodiaquine. Some novel mutations were also observed in pvdhfr and 
      pfdhfr genes.

TI  - Use of qPCR and genomic sequencing to diagnose Plasmodium ovale wallikeri malaria
      in a returned soldier in the setting of a negative rapid diagnostic assay.
PG  - 501-6

AB  - Plasmodium ovale is one of several clinically relevant malaria species known to
      cause disease in humans. However, in contrast to Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax, which are responsible for most cases of human malaria, P. ovale
      has a wide distribution but low prevalence in tropical regions. Here, we report
      the case of a soldier returning from Liberia with P. ovale wallikeri malaria.
      This case highlights the limitations of both microscopy and the malaria rapid
      diagnostic test for diagnosing infection with P. ovale and for distinguishing P. 
      ovale wallikeri from P. ovale curtisi. To our knowledge, this is the first case
      report in which quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification
      using the Cytochrome B gene, coupled with genomic sequencing of the potra locus, 
      was used for definitive diagnosis of P. ovale wallikeri malaria.

TI  - Plasmodium dipeptidyl aminopeptidases as malaria transmission-blocking drug
      targets.
PG  - 4645-52
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02495-12 [doi]
AB  - The Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei genomes each contain three dipeptidyl
      aminopeptidase (dpap) homologs. dpap1 and -3 are critical for asexual growth, but
      the role of dpap2, the gametocyte-specific homolog, has not been tested. If DPAPs
      are essential for transmission as well as asexual growth, then a DPAP inhibitor
      could be used for treatment and to block transmission. To directly analyze the
      role of DPAP2, a dpap2-minus P. berghei (Pbdpap2Delta) line was generated. The
      Pbdpap2Delta parasites grew normally, differentiated into gametocytes, and
      generated sporozoites that were infectious to mice when fed to a mosquito.
      However, Pbdpap1 transcription was >2-fold upregulated in the Pbdpap2Delta clonal
      lines, possibly compensating for the loss of Pbdpap2. The role of DPAP1 and -3 in
      the dpap2Delta parasites was then evaluated using a DPAP inhibitor, ML4118S. When
      ML4118S was added to the Pbdpap2Delta parasites just before a mosquito membrane
      feed, mosquito infectivity was not affected. To assess longer exposures to
      ML4118S and further evaluate the role of DPAPs during gametocyte development in a
      parasite that causes human malaria, the dpap2 deletion was repeated in P.
      falciparum. Viable P. falciparum dpap2 (Pfdpap2)-minus parasites were obtained
      that produced morphologically normal gametocytes. Both wild-type and
      Pfdpap2-negative parasites were sensitive to ML4118S, indicating that, unlike
      many antimalarials, ML4118S has activity against parasites at both the asexual
      and sexual stages and that DPAP1 and -3 may be targets for a dual-stage drug that
      can treat patients and block malaria transmission.

TI  - Sickle cell trait is not associated with endemic Burkitt lymphoma: an ethnicity
      and malaria endemicity-matched case-control study suggests factors controlling
      EBV may serve as a predictive biomarker for this pediatric cancer.
PG  - 645-53

AB  - Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
      Plasmodium falciparum coinfections. Malaria appears to dysregulate immunity that 
      would otherwise control EBV, thereby contributing to eBL etiology. Juxtaposed to 
      human genetic variants associated with protection from malaria, it has been
      hypothesized that such variants could decrease eBL susceptibility, historically
      referred to as "the protective hypothesis." Past studies attempting to link
      sickle cell trait (HbAS), which is known to be protective against malaria, with
      protection from eBL were contradictory and underpowered. Therefore, using a
      case-control study design, we examined HbAS frequency in 306 Kenyan children
      diagnosed with eBL compared to 537 geographically defined and ethnically matched 
      controls. We found 23.8% HbAS for eBL patients, which was not significantly
      different compared to 27.0% HbAS for controls [odds ratio (OR) = 0.85; 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.17; p-value = 0.33]. Even though cellular EBV
      titers, indicative of the number of latently infected B cells, were significantly
      higher (p-value < 0.0003) in children residing in malaria holoendemic compared to
      hypoendemic areas, levels were not associated with HbAS genotype. Combined, this 
      suggests that although HbAS protects against severe malaria and hyperparasitemia,
      it is not associated with viral control or eBL protection. However, based on
      receiver operating characteristic curves factors that enable the establishment of
      EBV persistence, in contrast to those involved in EBV lytic reactivation, may
      have utility as an eBL precursor biomarker. This has implications for future
      human genetic association studies to consider variants influencing control over
      EBV in addition to malaria as risk factors for eBL.

AB  - The genetic diversity displayed by Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly
      Plasmodium species, is a significant obstacle for effective malaria vaccine
      development. In this study, we identified genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum 
      glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), which is currently being tested in clinical
      trials as a malaria vaccine candidate, from isolates found circulating in the
      Brazilian Amazon at variable transmission levels. The study was performed using
      samples collected in 1993 and 2008 from rural villages situated near Porto Velho,
      in the state of Rondonia. DNA was extracted from 126 P. falciparum-positive thick
      blood smears using the phenol-chloroform method and subjected to a nested
      polymerase chain reaction protocol with specific primers against two
      immunodominant regions of GLURP, R0 and R2. Only one R0 fragment and four
      variants of the R2 fragment were detected. No differences were observed between
      the two time points with regard to the frequencies of the fragment variants.
      Mixed infections were uncommon. Our results demonstrate conservation of GLURP-R0 
      and limited polymorphic variation of GLURP-R2 in P. falciparum isolates from
      individuals living in Porto Velho. This is an important finding, as genetic
      polymorphisms in B and T-cell epitopes could have implications for the
      immunological properties of the antigen.

TI  - Evaluation of a real-time quantitative PCR to measure the wild Plasmodium
      falciparum infectivity rate in salivary glands of Anopheles gambiae.
PG  - 224
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of malaria sporozoite rates in the salivary glands of
      Anopheles gambiae is essential for estimating the number of infective mosquitoes,
      and consequently, the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). EIR is a key
      indicator for evaluating the risk of malaria transmission. Although the
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for detecting the circumsporozoite
      protein (CSP-ELISA) is routinely used in the field, it presents several
      limitations. A multiplex PCR can also be used to detect the four species of
      Plasmodium in salivary glands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
      of a real-time quantitative PCR in detecting and quantifying wild Plasmodium
      falciparum in the salivary glands of An. gambiae. METHODS: Anopheles gambiae
      (n=364) were experimentally infected with blood from P. falciparum gametocyte
      carriers, and P. falciparum in the sporozoite stage were detected in salivary
      glands by using a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. The sensitivity and
      specificity of this qPCR were compared with the multiplex PCR applied from the
      Padley method. CSP-ELISA was also performed on carcasses of the same mosquitoes. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of P. falciparum and the intensity of infection were
      evaluated using qPCR. This method had a limit of detection of six sporozoites per
      muL based on standard curves. The number of P. falciparum genomes in the salivary
      gland samples reached 9,262 parasites/muL (mean: 254.5; 95% CI: 163.5-345.6). The
      qPCR showed a similar sensitivity (100%) and a high specificity (60%) compared to
      the multiplex PCR. The agreement between the two methods was "substantial" (kappa
      = 0.63, P <0.05). The number of P. falciparum-positive mosquitoes evaluated with 
      the qPCR (76%), multiplex PCR (59%), and CSP-ELISA (83%) was significantly
      different (P <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR assay can be used to detect P.
      falciparum in salivary glands of An. gambiae. The qPCR is highly sensitive and is
      more specific than multiplex PCR, allowing an accurate measure of infective An.
      gambiae. The results also showed that the CSP-ELISA overestimates the sporozoite 
      rate, detecting sporozoites in the haemolymph in addition to the salivary glands.

AB  - The 28S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from P. falciparum and P. vivax
      isolates collected from northwest India. Based upon the sequence diversity of the
      Plasmodium 28SrRNA gene in comparison with its human counterpart, various nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed from the 3R region of the
      28SrRNA gene and evaluated on field isolates. This is the first report
      demonstrating the utility of this gene for species-specific diagnosis of malaria 
      for these two species, prevalent in India. The initial evaluation on 363 clinical
      isolates indicated that, in comparison with microscopy, which showed sensitivity 
      and specificity of 85.39% and 100% respectively, the sensitivity and specificity 
      of the nested PCR assay was found to be 99.08% and 100% respectively. This assay 
      was also successful in detecting mixed infections that are undetected by
      microscopy. Our results demonstrate the utility of the 28S rRNA gene as a
      diagnostic target for the detection of the major plasmodial species infecting
      humans.

      detection of hotspots with imperfect diagnostics.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At the local level, malaria transmission clusters in hotspots, which 
      may be a group of households that experience higher than average exposure to
      infectious mosquitoes. Active case detection often relying on rapid diagnostic
      tests for mass screen and treat campaigns has been proposed as a method to detect
      and treat individuals in hotspots. Data from a cross-sectional survey conducted
      in north-western Tanzania were used to examine the spatial distribution of
      Plasmodium falciparum and the relationship between household exposure and
      parasite density. METHODS: Dried blood spots were collected from consenting
      individuals from four villages during a survey conducted in 2010. These were
      analysed by PCR for the presence of P. falciparum, with the parasite density of
      positive samples being estimated by quantitative PCR. Household exposure was
      estimated using the distance-weighted PCR prevalence of infection. Parasite
      density simulations were used to estimate the proportion of infections that would
      be treated using a screen and treat approach with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT)
      compared to targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) and Mass Drug Administration
      (MDA). RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis revealed that of the 3,057
      blood samples analysed, 1,078 were positive. Mean distance-weighted PCR
      prevalence per household was 34.5%. Parasite density was negatively associated
      with transmission intensity with the odds of an infection being subpatent
      increasing with household exposure (OR 1.09 per 1% increase in exposure).
      Parasite density was also related to age, being highest in children five to ten
      years old and lowest in those > 40 years. Simulations of different tMDA
      strategies showed that treating all individuals in households where RDT
      prevalence was above 20% increased the number of infections that would have been 
      treated from 43 to 55%. However, even with this strategy, 45% of infections
      remained untreated. CONCLUSION: The negative relationship between household
      exposure and parasite density suggests that DNA-based detection of parasites is
      needed to provide adequate sensitivity in hotspots. Targeting MDA only to
      households with RDT-positive individuals may allow a larger fraction of
      infections to be treated. These results suggest that community-wide MDA, instead 
      of screen and treat strategies, may be needed to successfully treat the
      asymptomatic, subpatent parasite reservoir and reduce transmission in similar
      settings.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-218 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax co-exist and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDTs) is vital in
      rendering parasite-confirmed treatment especially in areas where microscopy from 
      2008 to 2010 is not available. CareStartTM Malaria Pf/Pv combo test was evaluated
      compared to microscopy in Butajira area, south-central Ethiopia. This RDT detects
      histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) found in P. falciparum, and Plasmodium enzyme
      lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) for diagnosis of P. vivax. The standard for the
      reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies was complied. Among 2,394 participants
      enrolled, 10.9% (n=87) were Plasmodium infected (household survey) and 24.5%
      (n=392) health facility-based using microscopy. In the household surveys, the
      highest positivity was caused by P. vivax (83.9%, n=73), P. falciparum (15.0%,
      n=13), and the rest due to mixed infections of both (1.1%, n=1). In health
      facility, P. vivax caused 78.6% (n=308), P. falciparum caused 20.4% (n=80), and
      the rest caused by mixed infections 1.0% (n=4). RDT missed 9.1% (n=8) in
      household and 4.3% (n=17) in health facility-based surveys among Plasmodium
      positive confirmed by microscopy while 3.3% (n=24) in household and 17.2% (n=208)
      in health facility-based surveys were detected false positive. RDT showed
      agreement with microscopy in detecting 79 positives in household surveys (n=796) 
      and 375 positives in health centre survey (n=1,598).RDT performance varied in
      both survey settings, lowest PPV (64.3%) for Plasmodium and P. falciparum (77.2%)
      in health centres; and Plasmodium (76.7%) and P. falciparum (87.5%) in household 
      surveys. NPV was low in P. vivax in health centres (77.2%) and household (87.5%) 
      surveys. Seasonally varying RDT precision of as low as 14.3% PPV (Dec. 2009), and
      38.5% NPV (Nov. 2008) in health centre surveys; and 40-63.6% PPV was observed in 
      household surveys. But the influence of age and parasite density on RDT
      performance was not ascertained. Establishing quality control of malaria RDT in
      the health system in areas with low endemic and where P. falciparum and P. vivax 
      co-exist is recommendable. CareStartTM RDT might be employed for epidemiological 
      studies that require interpreting the results cautiously. Future RDT field
      evaluation against microscopy should be PCR corrected.

TI  - Multiplex 5' nuclease quantitative real-time PCR for clinical diagnosis of
      malaria and species-level identification and epidemiologic evaluation of
      malaria-causing parasites, including Plasmodium knowlesi.
PG  - 2931-8
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00958-13 [doi]
AB  - Molecular diagnosis of malaria offers many potential advantages over microscopy, 
      including identification of malaria to the species level in an era with few
      experienced microscopists. We developed high-throughput multiplex 5' nuclease
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, with the potential to support large studies, to
      specifically identify Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and
      P. knowlesi. We compared qPCR to microscopy and confirmed discordant results with
      an alternative target PCR assay. The assays specifically detected 1 to 6
      parasites/mul of blood. The clinical sensitivities (95% confidence intervals
      [CIs]) of the 4-plex assay to detect microscopically confirmed malaria were 95.8%
      (88.3 to 99.1%) for P. falciparum, 89.5% (75.2 to 97.1%) for P. vivax, 94.1%
      (71.3 to 99.9%) for P. ovale, and 100% (66.4 to 100%) for P. malariae. The
      specificities (95% CIs) were 98.6% (92.4 to 100%) for P. falciparum, 99% (84.8 to
      100%) for P. vivax, 98.4% (94.4 to 99.8%) for P. ovale, and 99.3% (95.9 to 100%) 
      for P. malariae. The clinical specificity for samples without malaria was 100%.
      The clinical sensitivity of the 5-plex assay for confirmed P. knowlesi malaria
      was 100% (95% CI, 69.2 to 100%), and the clinical specificity was 100% (95% CI,
      87.2 to 100%). Coded retesting and testing with an alternative target PCR assay
      showed improved sensitivity and specificity of multiplex qPCR versus microscopy. 
      Additionally, 91.7% (11/12) of the samples with uncertain species by microscopy
      were identified to the species level identically by both our multiplex qPCR assay
      and the alternative target PCR assay, including 9 P. falciparum infections.
      Multiplex qPCR can rapidly and simultaneously identify all 5 Plasmodium species
      known to cause malaria in humans, and it offers an alternative or adjunct to
      microscopy for clinical diagnosis as well as a needed high-throughput tool for
      research.

      case report.
PG  - 83-5
LID - 10.1177/0049475513485733 [doi]
AB  - Severe pulmonary involvement in malaria has been frequently reported in cases of 
      Plasmodium falciparum infection but rarely in vivax malaria. We look at a case of
      a 38-year-old man living in a malaria endemic area who presented with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by P. vivax. DNA polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) confirmed that it was not a mixed infection. After specific
      antimalarial therapy and intensive supportive care, the patient was discharged
      from the hospital. This case illustrates that P. vivax-induced ARDS is not
      uncommon and should be readily recognized by the treating physicians. A
      confirmatory test with PCR is required in order to exclude P. falciparum
      co-infection.

TI  - An observational study of malaria in British travellers: Plasmodium ovale
      wallikeri and Plasmodium ovale curtisi differ significantly in the duration of
      latency.
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002711 [doi]
LID - e002711 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ovale malaria is caused by two closely related species of protozoan
      parasite: Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri Although
      clearly distinct genetically, there have been no studies comparing the
      morphology, life cycle or epidemiology of these parasites. We tested the
      hypothesis that the two species differ in the duration of latency prior to
      presentation with symptoms of blood-stage infection. DESIGN: PCR was used to
      identify P ovale curtisi and P ovale wallikeri infections among archived blood
      from UK malaria patients. Latency periods, estimated as the time between entry
      into the UK and diagnosis of malaria, were compared between the two groups.
      SETTING: UK National Reference Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: None. Archived parasite 
      material and surveillance data for 74 P ovale curtisi and 60 P ovale wallikeri
      infections were analysed. Additional epidemiological data were taken from a
      database of 1045 imported cases. OUTCOMES: None. RESULTS: No differences between 
      the two species were identified by a detailed comparison of parasite morphology
      (N=9, N=8, respectively) and sex ratio (N=5, N=4) in archived blood films. The
      geometric mean latency period in P ovale wallikeri was 40.6 days (95% CI 28.9 to 
      57.0), whereas that for P ovale curtisi was more than twice as long at 85.7 days 
      (95% CI 66.1 to 111.1; p=0.002). Further, the proportion of ovale malaria sensu
      lato which occurred in patients reporting chemoprophylaxis use was higher than
      for Plasmodium falciparum (OR 7.56; p<0.0001) or P vivax (OR 1.82; p<0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first difference of epidemiological
      significance observed between the two parasites which cause ovale malaria, and
      suggest that control measures aimed at P falciparum may not be adequate for
      reducing the burden of malaria caused by P ovale curtisi and P ovale wallikeri.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum (P.
      falciparum) field isolates in children from Lafia, North-central Nigeria, using
      the highly polymorphic P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP-2) gene as 
      molecular marker. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty children were enrolled into
      the study between 2005 and 2006. These included 140 children who presented with
      uncomplicated malaria at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia and another 
      180 children from the study area with asymptomatic infection. DNA was extracted
      from blood spot on filter paper and MSP-2 genes were genotyped using
      allele-specific nested PCR in order to analyze the genetic diversity of parasite 
      isolates. RESULTS: A total of 31 and 34 distinct MSP-2 alleles were identified in
      the asymptomatic and uncomplicated malaria groups respectively. No difference was
      found between the multiplicity of infection in the asymptomatic group and that of
      the uncomplicated malaria group (P>0.05). However, isolates of the FC27 allele
      type were dominant in the asymptomatic group whereas isolates of the 3D7 allele
      type were dominant in the uncomplicated malaria group. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed a high genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates in North-central
      Nigeria and is comparable to reports from similar areas with high malaria
      transmission intensity.

AB  - Nucleotide sequence analyses of the Pvs48/45 and Pvs47 genes were conducted in 46
      malaria patients from the Republic of Korea (ROK) (n = 40) and returning
      travellers from India (n = 3) and Indonesia (n = 3). The domain structures, which
      were based on cysteine residue position and secondary protein structure, were
      similar between Plasmodium vivax (Pvs48/45 and Pvs47) and Plasmodium falciparum
      (Pfs48/45 and Pfs47). In comparison to the Sal-1 reference strain (Pvs48/45,
      PVX_083235 and Pvs47, PVX_083240), Korean isolates revealed seven polymorphisms
      (E35K, H211N, K250N, D335Y, A376T, I380T and K418R) in Pvs48/45. These isolates
      could be divided into five haplotypes with the two major types having frequencies
      of 47.5% and 20%, respectivelfy. In Pvs47, 10 polymorphisms (F22L, F24L, K27E,
      D31N, V230I, M233I, E240D, I262T, I273M and A373V) were found and they could be
      divided into four haplotypes with one major type having a frequency of 75%. The
      Pvs48/45 isolates from India showed a unique amino acid substitution site (K26R).
      Compared to the Sal-1 and ROK isolates, the Pvs47 isolates from travellers
      returning from India and Indonesia had amino acid substitutions (S57T and I262K).
      The current data may contribute to the development of the malaria
      transmission-blocking vaccine in future clinical trials.

AB  - Management of coinfection with malaria and HIV is a major challenge to public
      health in developing countries, and yet potential drug-drug interactions between 
      antimalarial and antiviral regimens have not been adequately investigated in
      people with both infections. Each of the constituent components of
      artemether-lumefantrine, the first-line regimen for malaria treatment in Nigeria,
      and nevirapine, a major component of highly active antiretroviral therapy, are
      drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system, which is also
      known to be induced by nevirapine. We examined potential interactions between
      lumefantrine and nevirapine in 68 HIV-positive adults, all of whom were diagnosed
      with asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections by microscopy. Post hoc PCR
      analysis confirmed the presence of P. falciparum in only a minority of
      participants. Day 7 capillary blood levels of lumefantrine were significantly
      higher in HIV-positive participants than in 99 HIV-negative controls (P =
      0.0011). Associations between day 7 levels of lumefantrine and risk of persistent
      parasitemia could not be evaluated due to inadequate power. Further
      investigations of the impact of nevirapine on in vivo malaria treatment outcomes 
      in HIV-infected patients are thus needed.

TI  - High rates of parasite recrudescence following intermittent preventive treatment 
      with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy in Benin.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread parasite resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine 
      (SP) its use for intermittent preventative treatment during pregnancy remains the
      policy in Benin and throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In a
      prospective study, 982 pregnant women were recruited in Benin and followed until 
      delivery. The prevalence of point mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes
      associated with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to SP during consecutive
      antenatal visits was determined. Parasites clearance among women infected at SP
      intake was assessed by microscopy and PCR. Association between the persistence of
      parasites and malaria consequences, were investigated. Recurrent parasites were
      genotyped to identify recrudescences from re-infections. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      of pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutants (triple pfdhfr + single pfdhps) was
      consistently above 80% while quintuple and sextuple mutants remained low.
      Importantly the higly mutated parasites apparently never included the two key
      mutations, pfdhfr 164 L or pfdhps 540E. Based on PCR results, SP failed to clear 
      existing parasitaemia in half (48%) of the women who were infected at IPTp
      schedule. The frequency of recrudescence reached 76% after the second dose. Women
      with persistent parasitaemia had an increased prevalence of anaemia (P = 0.03).
      CONCLUSION: The data presented here, highlight the inability of SP to ensure
      optimal antiplasmodial protection in late pregnancy, and invite urgent
      consideration of an alternative drug or strategy.

TI  - In vitro susceptibility to quinine and microsatellite variations of the
      Plasmodium falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger transporter (Pfnhe-1) gene in 393 isolates
      from Dakar, Senegal.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-189 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the World Health Organization recommends replacing quinine
      (QN) by artesunate due to its increased efficacy and the higher tolerance to the 
      drug in both adults and children, QN remains a first-line treatment for severe
      malaria, especially in Africa. Investigations of microsatellite Pfnhe-1 ms4760
      polymorphisms in culture-adapted isolates from around the world have revealed
      that an increase in the number of DNNND amino acid motifs was associated with
      decreased QN susceptibility, whereas an increase in the number of DDNHNDNHNND
      motifs was associated with increased QN susceptibility. METHODS: In this context,
      to further analyse associations between Pfnhe-1 ms4760 polymorphisms and QN
      susceptibility, 393 isolates freshly collected between October 2009 and January
      2010 and July 2010 and February 2011, respectively, at the Hopital Principal de
      Dakar, Senegal were assessed ex vivo for QN susceptibility, and their genes were 
      amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Of the 393 Plasmodium falciparum clinical
      isolates collected, 145 were successfully cultured. The 145 QN IC50s ranged from 
      2.1 to 1291 nM, and 17 isolates (11.7%) exceed the QN reduced susceptibility
      threshold of 611 nM. Among the 393 P. falciparum clinical isolates, 47 different 
      alleles were observed. The three most prevalent profiles were ms4760-1 (no = 72; 
      18.3%), ms4760-3 (no = 65; 16.5%) and ms4760-7 (no = 40; 10.2%). There were no
      significant associations observed between QN IC50 values and i) the number of
      repeats of DNNND in block II (p = 0.0955, Kruskal-Wallis test); ii) the number of
      repeats of DDNHNDNHNND in block V (p = 0.1455, Kruskal-Wallis test); or iii)
      ms4760 profiles (p = 0.1809, Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: Pfnhe-1 ms4760
      was highly diverse in parasite isolates from Dakar (47 different profiles). Three
      profiles (ms4760-1, ms4760-3 and ms4760-7) were predominant. The number of
      repeats for block II (DNNND) or block V (DDNHNDNHNND) was not significantly
      associated with QN susceptibility. New studies, and especially in vivo studies,
      are necessary to confirm the role of Pfnhe-1 ms4760 as a marker of QN resistance.

      endemic and non-endemic settings.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a useful tool in endemic
      malaria countries, where light microscopy is not feasible. In non-endemic
      countries they can be used as complementary tests to provide timely results in
      case of microscopy inexperience. This study aims to compare the new VIKIA Malaria
      Ag Pf/Pan RDT with PCR-corrected microscopy results and the commonly used
      CareStart RDT to diagnose falciparum and non-falciparum malaria in the endemic
      setting of Bamako, Mali and the non-endemic setting of Lyon, France. METHODS:
      Blood samples were collected during a 12-months and six-months period in 2011
      from patients suspected to have malaria in Lyon and Bamako respectively. The
      samples were examined by light microscopy, the VIKIA Malaria Ag Pf/Pan test and
      in Bamako additionally with the CareStart RDT. Discordant results were corrected 
      by real-time PCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and
      negative predictive value were used to evaluate test performance. RESULTS:
      Samples of 877 patients from both sites were included. The VIKIA Malaria Ag
      Pf/Pan had a sensitivity of 98% and 96% for Plasmodium falciparum in Lyon and
      Bamako, respectively, performing similar to PCR-corrected microscopy.
      CONCLUSIONS: The VIKIA Malaria Ag Pf/Pan performs similar to PCR-corrected
      microscopy for the detection of P. falciparum, making it a valuable tool in
      malaria endemic and non-endemic regions.

TI  - Evaluation of three different DNA extraction methods from blood samples collected
      in dried filter paper in Plasmodium subpatent infections from the Amazon region
      in Brazil.

AB  - Asymptomatic Plasmodium infection is a new challenge for public health in the
      American region. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best method for
      diagnosing subpatent parasitemias. In endemic areas, blood collection is hampered
      by geographical distances and deficient transport and storage conditions of the
      samples. Because DNA extraction from blood collected on filter paper is an
      efficient method for molecular studies in high parasitemic individuals, we
      investigated whether the technique could be an alternative for Plasmodium
      diagnosis among asymptomatic and pauciparasitemic subjects. In this report we
      compared three different methods (Chelex(R)-saponin, methanol and TRIS-EDTA) of
      DNA extraction from blood collected on filter paper from asymptomatic
      Plasmodium-infected individuals. Polymerase chain reaction assays for detection
      of Plasmodium species showed the best results when the Chelex(R)-saponin method
      was used. Even though the sensitivity of detection was approximately 66% and 31% 
      for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively, this method did not show the
      effectiveness in DNA extraction required for molecular diagnosis of Plasmodium.
      The development of better methods for extracting DNA from blood collected on
      filter paper is important for the diagnosis of subpatent malarial infections in
      remote areas and would contribute to establishing the epidemiology of this form
      of infection.

TI  - Natural Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the state of Rondonia (Brazilian
      Western Amazon).
PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simian malaria is still an open question concerning the species of
      Plasmodium parasites and species of New World monkeys susceptible to the
      parasites. In addition, the lingering question as to whether these animals are
      reservoirs for human malaria might become important especially in a scenario of
      eradication of the disease. To aid in the answers to these questions, monkeys
      were surveyed for malaria parasite natural infection in the Amazonian state of
      Rondonia, Brazil, a state with intense environmental alterations due to human
      activities, which facilitated sampling of the animals. METHODS: Parasites were
      detected and identified in DNA from blood of monkeys, by PCR with primers for the
      18S rRNA, CSP and MSP1 genes and sequencing of the amplified fragments. Multiplex
      PCR primers for the 18S rRNA genes were designed for the parasite species
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae/Plasmodium
      brasilianum and Plasmodium simium. RESULTS: An overall infection rate of 10.9%
      was observed or 20 out 184 monkey specimens surveyed, mostly by P. brasilianum.
      However, four specimens of monkeys were found infected with P. falciparum, two of
      them doubly infected with P. brasilianum and P. falciparum. In addition, a
      species of monkey of the family Aotidae, Aotus nigriceps, is firstly reported
      here naturally infected with P. brasilianum. None of the monkeys surveyed was
      found infected with P. simium/P. vivax. CONCLUSION: The rate of natural
      Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the Brazilian state of Rondonia is in line
      with previous surveys of simian malaria in the Amazon region. The fact that a
      monkey species was found that had not previously been described to harbour
      malaria parasites indicates that the list of monkey species susceptible to
      Plasmodium infection is yet to be completed. Furthermore, finding monkeys in the 
      region infected with P. falciparum clearly indicates parasite transfer from
      humans to the animals. Whether this parasite can be transferred back to humans
      and how persistent the parasite is in monkeys in the wild so to be efficient
      reservoirs of the disease, is yet to be evaluated. Finding different species of
      monkeys infected with this parasite species suggests indeed that these animals
      can act as reservoirs of human malaria.

TI  - Molecular detection of malaria at delivery reveals a high frequency of

AB  - Plasmodium infection in pregnancy causes substantial maternal and infant
      morbidity and mortality. In Colombia, both P. falciparum and P. vivax are
      endemic, but the impact of either species on pregnancy is largely unknown in this
      country. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 96 pregnant women who
      delivered at their local hospital. Maternal, placental, and cord blood were
      tested for malaria infection by microscopy and real-time quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction (qPCR). A high frequency of infection was detected by qPCR (45%). 
      These infections had low concentrations of parasite DNA, and 79% were
      submicroscopic. Submicroscopic infections were associated with placental villitis
      and intervillitis. In conclusion, the overall frequency of Plasmodium infection
      at delivery in Colombia is much higher than previously reported. These data
      prompt a re-examination of the local epidemiology of malaria using molecular
      diagnostics to establish the clinical relevance of submicroscopic infections
      during pregnancy as well as their consequences for mothers and newborns.

TI  - Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum malaria and low birth weight in an area of
      unstable malaria transmission in Central Sudan.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria, which frequently occurs in pregnant women in the tropics, is
      a leading cause of maternal anaemia and low birth weight (LBW) in infants. Few
      data exist concerning malaria infections that are present at submicroscopic
      levels during pregnancy and their LBW delivery in babies. METHODS: A case-control
      study (87 in each group) was conducted at the Medani Hospital, Central Sudan.
      Cases were women who had LBW deliveries where the infants weighed < 2,500 g.
      Controls were parturient women without having LBW babies. Obstetrical and medical
      characteristics were gathered from both groups through structured questionnaires.
      Both cases and controls were investigated for malaria using microscopic blood
      film analysis, placental histology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Microscopic and PCR analyses were conducted on maternal peripheral blood,
      placenta, and umbilical cord samples. Infant weights were recorded immediately
      after birth. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum-positive blood films were not
      obtained from any of the women (cases or controls). Twenty-seven (31.0%) versus
      22 (25.3%) (P = 0.500) of the cases and controls, respectively, had placental
      malaria infections as determined by histological examination. In comparison to
      the controls, the submicroscopic malaria infection prevalence rates were
      significantly higher in the cases; 24 (27.6%) vs six (7.0%), P < 0.001.
      Multivariate analysis showed that while malaria infection of the placenta (based 
      on histology) was not associated with LBW, submicroscopic P. falciparum infection
      (OR = 6.89, 95% CI = 2.2-20.8; P = 0.001), or a combination of histologically
      determined and submicroscopic infections (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.2-4.9; P =
      0.012), were significantly associated with LBW. CONCLUSION: In Central Sudan,
      pregnant women were at a higher risk of having an LBW delivery if they had
      submicroscopic infections rather than a histological diagnosis of placental
      malaria.

AB  - Colombia has four main malaria transmission zones. In vivo efficacy studies
      carried out in these areas showed big differences in the response of Plasmodium
      falciparum to treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. In addition, there is
      still insufficient information about the genetics of P. falciparum populations.
      The objective of this study was to determine the haplotypes in dhfr and dhps
      genes of P. falciparum circulating in two distinct endemic zones. Samples from
      patients with non-complicated P. falciparum malaria were collected: 135 from
      Tumaco and 206 from Tierralta. Alleles 108 and 51 of the dhfr gene, and 437 and
      540 of the dhps gene were analyzed by PCR/enzymatic restriction, while alleles 59
      and 164 (dhfr), and 581(dhps) by PCR/dot blot/hybridization. Five different
      haplotypes were found, of which the triple mutant
      51I/C59/108N/I164/437G/K540/A581 was the most frequent (54.6%). In Tumaco, the
      parasites with wild haplotype predominated, while mutant parasites predominated
      in Tierralta. Another interesting finding is the presence of the C59R mutation in
      the dhfr gene in two samples, a mutation rarely found in South America. These
      data provide information about parasite population genetics and highlight the
      importance of starting a long term molecular surveillance program.

LID - 10.3347/kjp.2013.51.2.213 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium species. Most of the
      imported malaria in Korea are due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, 
      and Plasmodium ovale infections are very rare. Here, we report a case of a
      24-year-old American woman who acquired P. ovale while staying in Ghana, West
      Africa for 5 months in 2010. The patient was diagnosed with P. ovale malaria
      based on a Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear, Plasmodium
      genus-specific real-time PCR, Plasmodium species-specific nested PCR, and
      sequencing targeting 18S rRNA gene. The strain identified had a very long
      incubation period of 19-24 months. Blood donors who have malaria with a very long
      incubation period could be a potential danger for propagating malaria. Therefore,
      we should identify imported P. ovale infections not only by morphological
      findings but also by molecular methods for preventing propagation and appropriate
      treatment.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA-based diagnostic methods have been shown to be highly sensitive
      and specific for the detection of malaria. An 18S-rRNA-based, real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the prevalence and
      intensity of Plasmodium infections on Flores Island, Indonesia. METHODS:
      Microscopy and real-time multiplex PCR for the detection of Plasmodium species
      was performed on blood samples collected in a population-based study in
      Nangapanda Flores Island, Indonesia. RESULTS: A total 1,509 blood samples were
      analysed. Real-time PCR revealed prevalence for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
      vivax, and Plasmodium malariae to be 14.5%, 13.2%, and 1.9% respectively.
      Sub-microscopic parasitaemia were found in more than 80% of all positive cases.
      The prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax was significantly higher in subjects
      younger than 20 years (p </= 0.01). In the present study, among non-symptomatic
      healthy individuals, anaemia was strongly correlated with the prevalence and load
      of P. falciparum infections (p </= 0.01; p = 0.02) and with the load of P. vivax 
      infections (p = 0.01) as detected with real-time PCR. Subjects with AB blood
      group tend to have a higher risk of being infected with P. falciparum and P.
      vivax when compared to other blood groups. CONCLUSION: The present study has
      shown that real-time PCR provides more insight in the epidemiology of Plasmodium 
      infections and can be used as a monitoring tool in the battle against malaria.
      The unsurpassed sensitivity of real-time PCR reveals that sub microscopic
      infections are common in this area, which are likely to play an important role in
      transmission and control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trials number ISRCTN83830814.

PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-6-150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The control of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, 
      and typhus fever is often achieved with the use of insecticides. Unfortunately,
      insecticide resistance is becoming common among different vector species. There
      are currently no chemical alternatives to these insecticides because new
      human-safe classes of molecules have yet to be brought to the vector-control
      market. The identification of novel targets offer opportunities for rational
      design of new chemistries to control vector populations. One target family, G
      protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has remained relatively under explored in
      terms of insecticide development. METHODS: A novel classifier, Ensemble*, for
      vector GPCRs was developed. Ensemble* was validated and compared to existing
      classifiers using a set of all known GPCRs from Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae,
      Apis Mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Pediculus humanus.
      Predictions for unidentified sequences from Ae. aegypti, An. gambiae, and Pe.
      humanus were validated. Quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis was performed on 
      previously-known and newly discovered Ae. aegypti GPCR genes. RESULTS: We present
      a new analysis of GPCRs in the genomes of Ae, aegypti, a vector of dengue fever, 
      An. gambiae, a primary vector of Plasmodium falciparum that causes malaria, and
      Pe. humanus, a vector of epidemic typhus fever, using a novel GPCR classifier,
      Ensemble*, designed for insect vector species. We identified 30 additional
      putative GPCRs, 19 of which we validated. Expression of the newly discovered Ae. 
      aegypti GPCR genes was confirmed via quantitative RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: A novel
      GPCR classifier for insect vectors, Ensemble*, was developed and GPCR predictions
      were validated. Ensemble* and the validation pipeline were applied to the genomes
      of three insect vectors (Ae. aegypti, An. gambiae, and Pe. humanus), resulting in
      the identification of 52 GPCRs not previously identified, of which 11 are
      predicted GPCRs, and 19 are predicted and confirmed GPCRs.

TI  - C-terminal polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparium merozoite surface protein-1
      (MSP-1) from Tak Province, Thailand.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - This study was undertaken to ascertain the extent of polymorphism in the
      C-terminal region of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein (MSP-1) from
      119 malaria patients in Tak Province on the western border of Thailand, who were 
      admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical
      Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. P. falciparum infection was
      confirmed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears. Clinical
      manifestations were categorized into 2 groups: uncomplicated (94 cases) and
      complicated/severe (25 cases). A 1,040 basepair fragment of P. falciparum MSP-1
      gene was compared with MSP-1 of reference strains retrieved from GenBank. The
      consensus sequences of MSP-1 block 16 showed it belonged to MAD20 genotype, which
      is the major allele of falciparum malaria from the western border of Thailand.
      MSP-1 block 16 amino acid fragment could be separated into 2 groups: similar and 
      dissimilar to reference sequence. Four variations in MSP-1 block 16 were -1494K, 
      D1510G, D1556N, and K1696I. MSP-1 block 16 diversity is not significantly
      associated with clinical manifestation although MAD 20 genotype is the
      predominant genotype in this area. The genetic data of MSP1 gene of faciparum
      malaria isolated from western Thai border contribute to the existing genetic
      database of Thai P. falciparum strain.

      falciparum in mothers and newborns.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-13-215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Particular cytokine gene polymorphisms are involved in the regulation
      of the antibody production. The consequences of already described IL-4, IL-10 and
      IL-13 gene polymorphisms on biological parameters and antibody levels were
      investigated among 576 mothers at delivery and their newborns in the context of
      P. falciparum placental malaria infection. METHODS: The study took place in the
      semi-rural area of Tori-Bossito, in south-west Benin, where malaria is
      meso-endemic. Six biallelic polymorphisms were determined by quantitative PCR
      using TaqMan(R) Pre-Designed SNP Genotyping Assays, in IL-4 (rs2243250,
      rs2070874), IL-10 (rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872) and IL-13 (rs1800925) genes. 
      Antibody responses directed to P. falciparum MSP-1, MSP-2, MSP-3, GLURP-R0,
      GLURP-R2 and AMA-1 recombinant proteins were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The
      maternal IL-4(-590)*T/IL-4(+33)*T haplotype (one or two copies) was associated
      with favorable maternal condition at delivery (high haemoglobin levels, absence
      of placental parasites) and one of its component, the IL-4(-590)TT genotype, was 
      related to low IgG levels to MSP-1, MSP-2/3D7 and MSP-2/FC27. Inversely, the
      maternal IL-10(-1082)AA was positively associated with P. falciparum placenta
      infection at delivery. As a consequence, the IL-10(-819)*T allele (in CT and TT
      genotypes) as well as the IL-10(-1082)*A/IL-10(-819)*T/IL-10(-592)*A haplotype
      (one or two copies) in which it is included, were related to an increased risk
      for anaemia in newborns. The maternal IL-10(-1082)AA genotype was related to high
      IgG levels to MSP-2/3D7 and AMA-1 in mothers and newborns, respectively. The
      IL-13 gene polymorphism was only involved in the newborn's antibody response to
      AMA-1. CONCLUSION: These data revealed that IL-4 and IL-10 maternal gene
      polymorphisms are likely to play a role in the regulation of biological
      parameters in pregnant women at delivery (anaemia, P. falciparum placenta
      infection) and in newborns (anaemia). Moreover, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 maternal
      gene polymorphisms were related to IgG responses to MSP-1, MSP-2/3D7 and
      MSP-2/FC27 in mothers as well as to AMA-1 in newborns.

TI  - Expression of Tim-1 and Tim-3 in Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection.
PG  - 2713-9
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3442-z [doi]
AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is a serious and often fatal complication of Plasmodium
      falciparum infections; however, the precise mechanisms leading to CM is poorly
      understood. Mouse malaria models have provided insight into the key events in
      pathogenesis of CM. T-cell immune response is known to play an important role in 
      malaria infection, and members of the T-cell immunoglobulin- and
      mucin-domain-containing molecule (Tim) family have roles in T-cell-mediated
      immune responses. Tim-1 and Tim-3 are expressed on terminally differentiated Th2 
      and Th1 cells, respectively, and participate in the regulation of Th immune
      response. Until now, the role of Tim family proteins in Plasmodium infection
      remains unclear. In the present study, the mRNA levels of Tim-1, Tim-3, and some 
      key Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the spleen of Kunming outbred mice infected with
      Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbANKA) were determined using real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR). Compared with uninfected controls, Tim-1 expression was
      significantly decreased in infected mice with CM at day 10 postinfection (p.i.)
      but significantly increased in infected mice with non-CM at day 22 p.i.; in
      contrast, Tim-3 expression was significantly increased in infected mice both with
      CM at day 10 p.i. and with non-CM at day 22 p.i. The expressions of IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-12 were significantly increased but IL-4 was
      significantly decreased in infected mice with CM at days 10 p.i., whereas the
      expressions of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta were significantly
      increased but IL-12 was significantly decreased in infected mice with non-CM at
      days 22 p.i. Furthermore, the expression of Tim-1 and Tim-3 could reflect Th2 and
      Th1 immune response in the spleen of PbANKA-infected mice, respectively. Our data
      suggest that PbANKA infection could inhibit the differentiation of T lymphocytes 
      toward Th2 cells, promote the Th1 cell differentiation, and induce Th1-biased
      immune response in the early infective stage, whereas the infection could promote
      Th2 cell differentiation and induce Th2-biased immune response in the late
      infective stage. Our data indicate that both Tim-1 and Tim-3 may play a role in
      the process of PbANKA infection, which may represent a potential therapeutic
      target.

TI  - Genetic Diversity of Plasmodium falciparum Field Isolates in Central Sudan
      Inferred by PCR Genotyping of Merozoite Surface Protein 1 and 2.
PG  - 95-101
LID - 10.4103/1947-2714.107524 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum diversity is commonly
      achieved by amplification of the polymorphic regions of the merozoite surface
      proteins 1 (MSP1) and 2 (MSP2) genes. AIMS: The present study aimed to determine 
      the allelic variants distribution of MSP1 and MSP2 and multiplicity of infection 
      in P. falciparum field isolates from Kosti, central Sudan, an area characterized 
      by seasonal malaria transmission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 121 samples (N =
      121) were collected during a cross-sectional survey between March and April 2003.
      DNA was extracted and MSP1 and MSP2 polymorphic loci were genotyped. RESULTS: The
      total number of alleles identified in MSP1 block 2 was 11, while 16 alleles were 
      observed in MSP2 block 3. In MSP1, RO33 was found to be the predominant allelic
      type, carried alone or in combination with MAD20 and K1 types, whereas FC27
      family was the most prevalent in MSP2. Sixty two percent of isolates had multiple
      genotypes and the overall mean multiplicity of infection was 1.93 (CI 95%
      1.66-2.20). Age correlated with parasite density (P = 0.017). In addition, a
      positive correlation was observed between parasite densities and the number of
      alleles (P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Genetic diversity in P. falciparum field
      isolates in central Sudan was high and consisted of multiple clones.

      of malaria treatment policy.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Benin, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) changed the
      policy of malaria treatment in 2004 following increasing of failure rate of
      treatment with chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The
      objective of this study was to determinate the prevalence of Plasmodium
      falciparum molecular markers that are associated with resistance to CQ and SP in 
      Benin seven years after the new policy was instituted. METHODS: The study was
      conducted in southern Benin, a region characterized by a perennial malaria
      transmission. Blood samples were collected in 2011 from children presenting with 
      symptomatic and asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and living in the same
      area. The prevalence of critical point mutations in the genes of pfcrt (codon
      76), pfmdr1 (codon 86), pfdhfr (codons, 51, 59 and 108) and pfdhps (codons 437,
      540) was examined in parasite isolates by mutation-specific restriction enzyme
      digestion of nested PCR products. RESULTS: A high prevalence of parasites
      carrying point mutations in all studied targets was found: T76: 93.9% [89.8;
      96.7], I51: 96.2% [92.7; 98.4], R59: 93, 9% [89.7; 96.7], N108: 97.6% [94.6;
      99.2] and G437: 71.4% [64.8; 77.4]. No mutation was found at codon 540 of the
      pfdhps gene. The proportion of parasite isolates carrying triple mutation in the 
      pfdhfr gene IRN (I51, R59 andN108) and quadruple mutation on the combination of
      pfdhfr/pfdhps IRNG (I51, R59, N108 and G437) was 91.5% [86.9; 94.9] and 65.7%
      [58.9; 72.1], respectively. Analysis of mutation in relation to the clinical
      status (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and according to age (younger or older than 
      10 years) showed similar very high frequencies in each category without
      significant difference between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a
      persistence level of resistance of P. falciparum to CQ and SP, seven years after 
      the recommendation of the change of malaria treatment policy in Benin. The
      distribution of mutations studied was neither related to age nor to clinical
      status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is often considered a cause of adult sepsis in malaria
      endemic areas. However, diagnostic limitations can make distinction between
      malaria and other infections challenging. Therefore, the objective of this study 
      was to determine the relative contribution of malaria to adult sepsis in
      south-western Uganda. METHODS: Adult patients with sepsis were enrolled at the
      Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital between February and May 2012. Sepsis was
      defined as infection plus >/=2 of the following: axillary temperature >37.5
      degrees C or <35.5 degrees C, heart rate >90 or respiratory rate >20. Severe
      sepsis was defined as sepsis plus organ dysfunction (blood lactate >4 mmol/L,
      confusion, or a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg). Sociodemographic, clinical and
      laboratory data, including malaria PCR and rapid diagnostic tests, as well as
      acid fast bacteria sputum smears and blood cultures were collected. Patients were
      followed until in-patient death or discharge. The primary outcome of interest was
      the cause of sepsis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess
      predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Enrollment included 216 participants who were
      51% female with a median age of 32 years (IQR 27-43 years). Of these, 122 (56%)
      subjects were HIV-seropositive of whom 75 (66%) had a CD4+ T cell count <100
      cells/muL. The prevalence of malaria was 4% (six with Plasmodium falciparum, two 
      with Plasmodium vivax). Bacteraemia was identified in 41 (19%) patients.
      In-hospital mortality was 19% (n = 42). In multivariable regression analysis,
      Glasgow Coma Score <9 (IRR 4.81, 95% CI 1.80-12.8) and severe sepsis (IRR, 2.07, 
      95% CI 1.03-4.14), but no specific diagnoses were statistically associated with
      in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Malaria was an uncommon cause of adult sepsis 
      in a regional referral hospital in south-western Uganda. In this setting, a
      thorough evaluation for alternate causes of disease in patients presenting with
      sepsis is recommended.

TI  - Highly sensitive detection of malaria parasitemia in a malaria-endemic setting:
      performance of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification kit in a remote
      clinic in Uganda.
PG  - 645-52
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current malaria diagnostic tests, including microscopy and
      antigen-detecting rapid tests, cannot reliably detect low-density infections.
      Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive
      but remain too complex for field deployment. A new commercial molecular assay
      based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was assessed for field
      use. METHODS: Malaria LAMP (Eiken Chemical, Japan) was evaluated for samples from
      272 outpatients at a rural Ugandan clinic and compared with expert microscopy,
      nested PCR, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two technicians performed the assay
      after 3 days of training, using 2 alternative blood sample-preparation methods
      and visual interpretation of results by fluorescence assay. RESULTS: Compared
      with 3-well nested PCR, the sensitivity of both LAMP and single-well nested PCR
      was 90%; the microscopy sensitivity was 51%. For samples with a Plasmodium
      falciparum qPCR titer of >/= 2 parasites/microL, LAMP sensitivity was 97.8% (95% 
      confidence interval, 93.7%-99.5%). Most false-negative LAMP results involved
      samples with parasitemia levels detectable by 3-well nested PCR but very low or
      undetectable by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria LAMP in a remote Ugandan clinic
      achieved sensitivity similar to that of single-well nested PCR in a United
      Kingdom reference laboratory. LAMP dramatically lowers the detection threshold
      achievable in malaria-endemic settings, providing a new tool for diagnosis,
      surveillance, and screening in elimination strategies.

      imported malaria.
PG  - 637-44
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of malaria relies on parasite detection by microscopy or
      antigen detection; both fail to detect low-density infections. New tests
      providing rapid, sensitive diagnosis with minimal need for training would enhance
      both malaria diagnosis and malaria control activities. We determined the
      diagnostic accuracy of a new loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) kit in febrile
      returned travelers. METHODS: The kit was evaluated in sequential blood samples
      from returned travelers sent for pathogen testing to a specialist parasitology
      laboratory. Microscopy was performed, and then malaria LAMP was performed using
      Plasmodium genus and Plasmodium falciparum-specific tests in parallel. Nested
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on all samples as the reference
      standard. Primary outcome measures for diagnostic accuracy were sensitivity and
      specificity of LAMP results, compared with those of nested PCR. RESULTS: A total 
      of 705 samples were tested in the primary analysis. Sensitivity and specificity
      were 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively, for the LAMP P. falciparum primers and 97.0% 
      and 99.2%, respectively, for the Plasmodium genus primers. Post hoc repeat PCR
      analysis of all 15 tests with discrepant results resolved 4 results in favor of
      LAMP, suggesting that the primary analysis had underestimated diagnostic
      accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria LAMP had a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of 
      nested PCR, with a greatly reduced time to result, and was superior to expert
      microscopy.

TI  - Anopheles culicifacies sibling species in Odisha, eastern India: First appearance
      of Anopheles culicifacies E and its vectorial role in malaria transmission.
PG  - 810-21
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the Anopheles culicifacies sibling species complex and
      study their vectorial role in malaria endemic regions of Odisha. METHODS:
      Mosquitoes were collected from 6 malaria endemic districts using standard
      entomological collection methods. An. culicifacies sibling species were
      identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cytochrome oxidase 
      subunit II (COII) region of mitochondrial DNA. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
      sporozoite rate and human blood fed percentage (HBF) were estimated by PCR using 
      Pf- and human-specific primers. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were
      performed to confirm the type of sibling species of An. culicifacies found in
      Odisha. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR detected An. culicifacies sibling species A, B, C,
      D and E in the malaria endemic regions of Odisha. An. culicifacies E was detected
      for the first time in Odisha, which was further confirmed by molecular
      phylogenetics. Highest sporozoite rate and HBF percentage were observed in An.
      culicifacies E in comparison with other sibling species. An. culicifacies E
      collected from Nawarangapur, Nuapara and Keonjhar district showed high HBF
      percentage and sporozoite rates. CONCLUSION: An. culicifacies B was the most
      abundant species, followed by An. culicifacies C and E. High sporozoite rate and 
      HBF of An. culicifacies E indicated that it plays an important role in malaria
      transmission in Odisha. Appropriate control measures against An. culicifacies E
      at an early stage are needed to prevent further malaria transmission in Odisha.

TI  - Plasmodium knowlesi infection: a diagnostic challenge.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2013-009558 [doi]
LID - bcr2013009558 [pii]
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi malaria is an uncommon, but highly prevalent parasitic
      infection in parts of Malaysia. This is the case of a 14-year-old Singaporean boy
      presenting to our emergency department with an 11-day history of fever following 
      a school trip to Malaysia. Hepatosplenomegaly was the only clinical finding;
      laboratory tests showed thrombocytopaenia, lymphopaenia, mild anaemia and liver
      transaminitis. Specific malaria antigen tests were negative, but the peripheral
      blood film showed plasmodia with atypical features, with a parasite load of 0.5%.
      PCR confirmed the diagnosis of P knowlesi. The patient was successfully treated
      with chloroquine. The clinical course of P knowlesi malaria is indistinguishable 
      from that of Plasmodium falciparum. This case highlights the importance of taking
      detailed travel history, careful examination of malaria blood films and judicious
      use of molecular techniques. Antigen tests alone may have missed a malaria
      diagnosis altogether, while blood film examination may wrongly identify the
      species as Plasmodium malariae or P falciparum. Third-generation PCR assays can
      be used to reliably identify P knowlesi.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate microscopy, OptiMAL((R)) and multiplex PCR for the
      identification of Plasmodium falciparumm (P. falciparum) and Plasmodium vivax (P.
      vivax) from the field isolates of Bikaner, Rajasthan (Northwest India). METHODS: 
      In this study, a multiplex PCR (P. falciparum and P. vivax) was further developed
      with the incorporation of Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae) specific primer and
      also a positive control. The performance of microscopy, plasmodium lactate
      dehydrogenase (pLDH) based malaria rapid diagnostic test OptiMAL((R)) and 18S
      rRNA gene based multiplex PCR for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax was
      compared. RESULTS: The three species multiplex PCR (P. falciparum, P. vivax and
      P. malariae) with an inbuilt positive control was developed and evaluated. In
      comparison with multiplex PCR, which showed the sensitivity and specificity of
      99.36% (95%CI, 98.11%-100.00%) and 100.00% (95%CI, 100.00%-100.00%), the
      sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was 90.44% (95%CI, 88.84%-95.04%) and
      99.22% (95%CI, 97.71%-100.00%), and OptiMAL((R)) was 93.58% (95%CI,
      89.75%-97.42%) and 97.69% (95%CI, 95.10%-100.00%). The efficiencies were 99.65%, 
      95.10% and 95.45% for multiplex PCR, microscopy and OptiMAL((R)), respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results raise concerns over the overall sensitivities of
      microscopy and OptiMAL((R)), when compared to the multiplex PCR and thus stress
      the need for new molecular interventions in the accurate detection of the
      malarial parasites. This further highlights the fact that further developments
      are needed to improve the performance of rapid diagnostic tests at field level.

TI  - The role of Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles coustani in indoor and outdoor
      malaria transmission in Taveta District, Kenya.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-6-114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scaling up of malaria vector control efforts in Africa has
      resulted in changing the malaria vectorial systems across different ecological
      settings. In view of the ongoing trends in vector population dynamics, abundance,
      species composition and parasite infectiousness, there is a need to understand
      vector distribution and their contribution to malaria transmission to facilitate 
      future planning of control strategies. We studied indoor and outdoor malaria
      transmission dynamics and vector population variability of Anopheles mosquitoes
      in Taveta district along the Kenyan Coast. METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were
      collected indoors and outdoors in 4 ecologically different villages using CDC
      light traps (both indoor and outdoor) and aspiration method (day resting indoors;
      DRI) methods. Mosquitoes were examined for infection with P. falciparum
      sporozoites and blood feeding preferences using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). The An. gambiae and An. funestus complexes were identified by PCR
      technique to determine the sibling species composition. RESULTS: A total of 4,004
      Anopheles mosquitoes were collected consisting of 34.9%% (n = 1,397) An. gambiae 
      s.1., 28.1% (n = 1,124) An. funestus s.l., 33.5% (n = 1,340) An. coustani and
      3.6% (n = 143) An. pharoensis. A total of 14,654 culicine mosquitoes were
      collected, mainly Cx. quinquefasciatus. Of the total Anopheles collected, 3,729
      were tested for P. falciparum sporozoite infection. The sporozoite transmission
      was found to be occurring both indoors and outdoors. The overall sporozoite
      infectivity was 0.68% (n = 2,486) indoors and 1.29% (n = 1,243) outdoors. Indoor 
      and outdoor sporozoite infectivity and the vectorial systems varied across the 4 
      ecological villages. Entomological inoculation rates for the 4 villages indicate 
      that there was site-to-site variation. In the 4 villages, Mwarusa had the highest
      EIRs with An. arabiensis, An. funestus and An. coustani contributing to 23.91,
      11.96 and 23.91 infectious bites per person per year ib/p/year respectively. In
      Kiwalwa and Njoro outdoor EIR was significantly higher than indoors. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study shows that malaria transmission is occurring both indoors and
      outdoors. The main vectors are An. arabiensis, An. funestus and An. coustani
      indoors while An. coustani is playing a major role in outdoor transmission.
      Effective malaria control programmes, should therefore include tools that target 
      both indoor and outdoor transmission.

TI  - The effects of co-infection with human parvovirus B19 and Plasmodium falciparum
      on type and degree of anaemia in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 129-39
LID - 10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60037-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determin the extent to which parvovirus B19 (B19V) and co-infection
      of B19V and malaria contribute to risk of anaemia in children. METHODS: B19V DNA 
      and malaria parasites were screened for 234 children at the PML Children's
      Hospital in Accra. The role of B19V and co-infection with B19V and malaria in
      anaemia was evaluated by analysing full blood cell counts, malaria and B19V DNA
      results from these children. RESULTS: The prevalence of B19V, malaria and
      co-infection with B19V and malaria was 4.7%, 41.9% and 2.6%, respectively.
      Malaria posed a greater risk in the development of mild anaemia compared to
      severe anaemia (OR=5.28 vrs 3.15) whereas B19V posed a higher risk in the
      development of severe anaemia compared to mild anaemia (OR=4.07 vrs 1.00) from a 
      non-anaemic child. Persons with co-infection with B19V and malaria had 2.23 times
      the risk (95% CI=0.40-12.54) of developing severe anaemia should they already
      have a mild anaemia. The degree of anaemia was about three times affected by
      co-infection (Pillai's trace=0.551, P=0.001) as was affected by malaria alone
      (Pillai's trace=0.185, P=0.001). B19V alone did not significantly affect the
      development of anaemia in a non-anaemic child. Microcytic anaemia was associated 
      with B19V and co-infection with B19V and malaria more than normocytic
      normochromic anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: B19V was associated with malaria in cases of
      severe anaemia. The association posed a significant risk for exacerbation of
      anaemia in mild anaemic children. B19V and co-infection with B19V and malaria may
      be associated with microcytic anaemia rather than normocytic normochromic anaemia
      as seen in cases of B19V infection among persons with red cell abnormalities.

PG  - e2155
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax can potentially lead to life-threatening episodes
      but the mechanisms underlying severe disease remain poorly defined. Cytoadhesion 
      of infected erythrocytes may contribute to P. vivax sequestration and organ
      injury although its physiological impact is still unknown. Here, we aimed to
      describe clinically-relevant cytoadhesive phenotypes of P. vivax isolates.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rosetting and adhesion to CSA, CD36, ICAM1,
      placental and brain cryosections were determined in P. vivax peripheral isolates 
      from 12 pregnant women, 24 non-pregnant women and 23 men from Manaus (Brazil). P.
      falciparum co-infection was excluded by PCR and P. vivax isolates were genotyped 
      by assessing the size polymorphism of microsatellites ms2, ms20 and msp1F3
      through capillary electrophoresis of PCR products. P. vivax monoinfection was
      confirmed by PCR in 59 isolates, with 50 (85%) of them being single-clone
      infections. One P. vivax haplotype was more frequently found among pregnant women
      (33%) than in non-pregnant women (0%) and men (4%; p=0.010). Rosetting was
      observed in 64% of the isolates, adhesion to CSA in 15%, to ICAM1 in 12% and to
      placental cryosections in 9%, being similar among pregnant and non-pregnant
      groups. Intensity of rosetting was higher among anaemic individuals compared to
      non-anaemic (p=0.010) and decreased with increasing haematocrit (p=0.033) and
      haemoglobin levels (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: P. vivax peripheral
      isolates from pregnant women do not exhibit a prominent adhesion to CSA, although
      other parasite phenotypes still unknown may increase the propagation of certain
      P. vivax clones observed among pregnant hosts. Rosetting is a frequent
      cytoadhesive phenotype in P. vivax infections that may contribute to the
      development of anaemia.

AB  - Our study investigated the possible impact of SP-IPT given to infants and
      children on the prevalence of SP-resistant haplotypes in the Plasmodium
      falciparum genes Pfdhfr and Pfdhps, comparing sites with and without IPTi/c. P.
      falciparum positive samples (N = 352) collected from children < 5 years were
      analyzed to determine the prevalence of SP resistance-related haplotypes by
      nested PCR followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe-enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. The prevalence of the Pfdhfr triple mutant haplotype (CIRN) 
      increased in both groups, but only significantly in the IPTi/c group from 41% to 
      65% in 2011 (P = 0.005). Conversely, the Pfdhps 437G mutation decreased in both
      groups from 44.6% to 28.6% (P = 0.07) and from 66.7% to 47.5% (P = 0.02) between 
      2010 and 2011 in the control and the IPTi/c groups, respectively. A weak trend
      for decreasing prevalence of quadruple mutants (triple Pfdhfr + Pfdhps 437G) was 
      noted in both groups (P = 0.15 and P = 0.34). During the two cross-sectional
      surveys some significant changes were observed in the SP resistance-related
      genes.

      malaria in an area of unstable malaria transmission in Eastern Sudan.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/1746-1596-8-59 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum malaria during pregnancy is a great 
      challenge for clinicians because of the low density of parasites in the
      peripheral blood and parasite sequestration in the placenta. Nevertheless, few
      data on the use of malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) during pregnancy have been
      published. METHODS: P. falciparum infections were assessed in 156 febrile
      pregnant women by microscopic examination of their blood smears and by RDT and
      polymerase chain reactions (PCR). In addition, 150 women were assessed at the
      time of delivery by microscopy, RDT, PCR and placental histology investigations. 
      The study was conducted at the Gadarif Hospital, Eastern Sudan. The SD Bioline P.
      f / P. v (Bio Standard Diagnostics, Gurgaon, Korea) RDT kit was evaluated in this
      study. RESULTS: Among the febrile pregnant women, 17 (11.0%), 26 (16.7%) and 18
      (11.5%) positive cases of P. falciparum were detected by microscopy, RDT, and
      PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the microscopy was 94.4%
      and 100%, respectively. The corresponding values for RDT evaluation were 83.3%
      and 92.0%, as compared with PCR as the gold standard.While there were no detected
      cases of malaria by microscopic examination of blood smears, 27 (18.0%),
      21(14.0%) and 46 (30.7%) out of the 150 placentae investigated had P. falciparum 
      as determined by RDT, PCR, and histology, respectively. The sensitivity and
      specificity for RDT was 17.4% and 81.7%, respectively. The corresponding values
      for PCR were 6.5% and 82.7%, where histology was used as the gold standard.
      CONCLUSIONS: The RDT kit used in this study has poor performance for peripheral
      and placental P. falciparum malaria detection in this setting. VIRTUAL SLIDES:

TI  - Verification of clinically diagnosed cases during malaria elimination programme
      in Guizhou Province of China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: China is implementing a National Malaria Elimination Programme. A
      high proportion of clinically diagnosed malaria cases is reported in some
      provinces of China. In order to understand the exact situation and make clear the
      nature of these patients, it is of much importance to make case verifications,
      particularly from the pathogenic perspective. METHODS: Guizhou Province was
      targeted because of its high proportion of clinically diagnosed malaria cases.
      After random selection of around 10% of malaria cases from 1 May 2011 to 30 April
      2012, reported through the national web-based case reporting system from this
      province, field verifications were made on 14-17 May 2012 as follows. Firstly,
      the reported information of each case was rechecked with the onsite case
      registrations and investigation forms, and an in-depth interview was conducted
      with each patient. Secondly, the patient's blood smears kept by local CDC were
      cross-checked microscopically by a national experienced microscopist. Thirdly,
      two kinds of polymerase chain reaction (PCRs). including Tag-primer
      nested/multiplex PCR (UT-PCR) based on cytochrome oxidase gene (cox I) and nested
      PCR based on 18s rRNA gene were performed simultaneously using local CDC kept
      filter paper of dry blood samples to identify the Plasmodium spp. RESULTS: Twelve
      out of 152 malaria cases were selected, including nine clinically diagnosed
      malaria cases, two confirmed falciparum malaria cases and one confirmed vivax
      malaria case. The original case documents on the site were completely in
      conformity with their reported data, and all the patients recalled their malaria 
      symptoms and being cured only after consuming the corresponding anti-malarial
      drugs. Moreover, the re-examination results of microscopy and PCR were exactly in
      agreement with the original tests. DISCUSSION: No inconsistent results were found
      against the reported case information in the present study and the reasons for
      clinically diagnosed patients remains unclear. Uniform and standardized sample
      collection and processing should be trained among clinicians, more sensitive and 
      specific techniques should be explored to used in malaria diagnosis. A further
      study is needed in order to be more observationally focussed rather than
      retrospective.

TI  - Changes in the transcriptome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum during
      the initial phase of transmission from the human to the mosquito.
PG  - 256
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-14-256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum from
      the human to the mosquito is mediated by dormant sexual precursor cells, the
      gametocytes, which become activated in the mosquito midgut. Because gametocytes
      are the only parasite stages able to establish an infection in the mosquito, they
      play a crucial role in spreading the tropical disease. The human-to-mosquito
      transmission triggers important molecular changes in the gametocytes, which
      initiate gametogenesis and prepare the parasite for life-cycle progression in the
      insect vector. RESULTS: To better understand gene regulations during the initial 
      phase of malaria parasite transmission, we focused on the transcriptome changes
      that occur within the first half hour of parasite development in the mosquito.
      Comparison of mRNA levels of P. falciparum gametocytes before and 30 min
      following activation using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) identified
      126 genes, which changed in expression during gametogenesis. Among these, 17.5%
      had putative functions in signaling, 14.3% were assigned to cell cycle and gene
      expression, 8.7% were linked to the cytoskeleton or inner membrane complex, 7.9% 
      were involved in proteostasis and 6.4% in metabolism, 12.7% were cell
      surface-associated proteins, 11.9% were assigned to other functions, and 20.6%
      represented genes of unknown function. For 40% of the identified genes there has 
      as yet not been any protein evidence.For a subset of 27 genes, transcript changes
      during gametogenesis were studied in detail by real-time RT-PCR. Of these, 22
      genes were expressed in gametocytes, and for 15 genes transcript expression in
      gametocytes was increased compared to asexual blood stage parasites. Transcript
      levels of seven genes were particularly high in activated gametocytes, pointing
      at functions downstream of gametocyte transmission to the mosquito. For selected 
      genes, a regulated expression during gametogenesis was confirmed on the protein
      level, using quantitative confocal microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained
      transcriptome data demonstrate the regulations of gene expression immediately
      following malaria parasite transmission to the mosquito. Our findings support the
      identification of proteins important for sexual reproduction and further
      development of the mosquito midgut stages and provide insights into the genetic
      basis of the rapid adaption of Plasmodium to the insect vector.

TI  - Plasmodium vivax malaria in Duffy-negative individuals from Ethiopia.
PG  - 328-31
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trt016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium
      vivax and polymorphisms in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene 
      in patients with suspected malaria from eastern (Harar) and southwestern (Jimma) 
      Ethiopia. METHODS: Plasmodium presence and species was assessed by microscopy in 
      1304 and 627 febrile patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively, during
      October-November 2009. All microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by PCR.
      DARC gene polymorphisms were identified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Plasmodium
      vivax was the dominant species in Harar (74/98, 76%) and P. falciparum was more
      common in Jimma (70/107, 65%). We found 17/98 (17%) and 24/107 (22%) homozygous
      Duffy-negative patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively. Unexpectedly, three
      Duffy-negative patients from Harar had P. vivax malaria. CONCLUSION: This study
      documents the emergence of P. vivax malaria in Duffy-negative individuals in
      Ethiopia. The Duffy-negative blood group does not appear to provide absolute
      protection against P. vivax infection in this region.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1217712110 [doi]
AB  - Gametocytes are essential for Plasmodium transmission, but little is known about 
      the mechanisms that lead to their formation. Using piggyBac transposon-mediated
      insertional mutagenesis, we screened for parasites that no longer form mature
      gametocytes, which led to the isolation of 29 clones (insertional
      gametocyte-deficient mutants) that fail to form mature gametocytes. Additional
      analysis revealed 16 genes putatively responsible for the loss of
      gametocytogenesis, none of which has been previously implicated in
      gametocytogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and detection of an early stage
      gametocyte antigen determined that a subset of these mutants arrests development 
      at stage I or in early stage II gametocytes, likely representing genes involved
      in gametocyte maturation. The remaining mutants seem to arrest before formation
      of stage I gametocytes and may represent genes involved in commitment to the
      gametocyte lineage.

PG  - 340-5
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit156 [doi]
AB  - Controlled human malaria infection is used to measure efficacy of candidate
      malaria vaccines before field studies are undertaken. Mathematical modeling using
      data from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) parasitemia monitoring
      can discriminate between vaccine effects on the parasite's liver and blood
      stages. Uncertainty regarding the most appropriate modeling method hinders
      interpretation of such trials. We used qPCR data from 267 Plasmodium falciparum
      infections to compare linear, sine-wave, and normal-cumulative-density-function
      models. We find that the parameters estimated by these models are closely
      correlated, and their predictive accuracy for omitted data points was similar. We
      propose that future studies include the linear model.

      not represent a recurrent source of human malaria.
PG  - 7020-5

AB  - Wild-living chimpanzees and gorillas harbor a multitude of Plasmodium species,
      including six of the subgenus Laverania, one of which served as the progenitor of
      Plasmodium falciparum. Despite the magnitude of this reservoir, it is unknown
      whether apes represent a source of human infections. Here, we used Plasmodium
      species-specific PCR, single-genome amplification, and 454 sequencing to screen
      humans from remote areas of southern Cameroon for ape Laverania infections. Among
      1,402 blood samples, we found 1,000 to be Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
      positive, all of which contained human parasites as determined by sequencing
      and/or restriction enzyme digestion. To exclude low-abundance infections, we
      subjected 514 of these samples to 454 sequencing, targeting a region of the mtDNA
      genome that distinguishes ape from human Laverania species. Using algorithms
      specifically developed to differentiate rare Plasmodium variants from
      454-sequencing error, we identified single and mixed-species infections with P.
      falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and/or Plasmodium ovale. However, none of the
      human samples contained ape Laverania parasites, including the gorilla precursor 
      of P. falciparum. To characterize further the diversity of P. falciparum in
      Cameroon, we used single-genome amplification to amplify 3.4-kb mtDNA fragments
      from 229 infected humans. Phylogenetic analysis identified 62 new variants, all
      of which clustered with extant P. falciparum, providing further evidence that P. 
      falciparum emerged following a single gorilla-to-human transmission. Thus, unlike
      Plasmodium knowlesi-infected macaques in southeast Asia, African apes harboring
      Laverania parasites do not seem to serve as a recurrent source of human malaria, 
      a finding of import to ongoing control and eradication measures.

AB  - Due to the presence of the lake Quarun and to the particular nature of its
      irrigation system, it has been speculated that the Fayum, a large depression 80
      kilometers south-west of modern Cairo, was exposed to the hazards of malaria in
      historic times. Similarly, it has been speculated that, in the same area, also
      human tuberculosis might have been far more widespread in the antiquity than in
      its recent past. If these hypotheses were confirmed, it would imply that frequent
      cases of co-infection between the two pathogens might have occurred in ancient
      populations. To substantiate those speculations, molecular analyses were carried 
      out on sixteen mummified heads recovered from the necropolis of Abusir el Meleq
      (Fayum) dating from the 3(rd) Intermediate Period (1064-656 BC) to the Roman
      Period (30 BC-300 AD). Soft tissue biopsies were used for DNA extractions and PCR
      amplifications using well-suited protocols. A partial 196-bp fragment of
      Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 gene and a 123-bp fragment of the
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex insertion sequence IS6110 were amplified and
      sequenced in six and five of the sixteen specimens, respectively. A 100%
      concordance rates between our sequences and those of P. falciparum and M.
      tuberculosis complex ones were obtained. Lastly, concomitant PCR amplification of
      P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis complex DNA specific fragments was obtained in 
      four mummies, three of which are (14)C dated to the Late and Graeco-Roman
      Periods. Our data confirm that the hydrography of Fayum was extremely conducive
      to the spread of malaria. They also support the notion that the agricultural boom
      and dense crowding occurred in this region, especially under the Ptolemies,
      highly increased the probability for the manifestation and spread of
      tuberculosis. Here we extend back-wards to ca. 800 BC new evidence for malaria
      tropica and human tuberculosis co-occurrence in ancient Lower Egypt.

AB  - We attempted to improve the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method 
      for malaria diagnosis by using a simple DNA extraction procedure, and a portable 
      device performing both the amplification and detection of LAMP in one platform.
      Additionally, the device served as a heating block for the DNA preparation. We
      refer this method as LAMP-Tube scanner, and evaluated using 209 microscopically
      positive malaria samples and compared them to RDTs and LAMP-Thermocycler. Two
      most common human infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The LAMP-Tube
      scanner method is found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA
      amplification. The time to amplification varied but was closely less than 60 min.
      Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP-Tube scanner in detecting Plasmodium
      falciparum were 95% and 93.3%, compared to microscopy and 98.3% and 100%
      respectively, compared to standard LAMP-Thermocycler. In addition, it showed a
      detection limit of 10 and 40 copies of the parasitemia for Plasmodium vivax and
      P. falciparum. Accordingly, in comparison to the results obtained by microscopy, 
      the LAMP-Tube scanner had a less divergence in sensitivity and specificity, and
      yielded results similar to those of LAMP-Thermocycler. This method has the great 
      potential as a field usable molecular tool for the diagnosis of malaria and is an
      alternative to conventional PCR-based diagnostic methods for field use.

AB  - The Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen1 (AMA1) is a leading malaria
      vaccine candidate antigen. In the present investigation, for the first time, the 
      almost full length of the ama1 gene covering domain I (DI), DII and DIII was PCR 
      amplified and sequenced in 21 P. falciparum isolates collected from the
      southeastern parts of Iran. The result showed the low genetic diversity of
      Iranian PfAMA1 with 11 PfAMA1 haplotypes in which nine out of 11 haplotypes are
      novel and have been reported for the first time. The Iranian P. falciparum
      population indicated a moderate level of genetic differentiation. The difference 
      among the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, Tajima's D and
      McDonald-Kreitman tests suggested that the diversity at DI is due to positive
      natural selection. In addition, recombination contributes to the diversity of
      Iranian PfAMA1 and this is supported by the decline of the linkage disequilibrium
      index R(2) with increasing the nucleotide distance. The highly polymorphic
      residues (positions: 187, 197, 200, 230 and 243) were polymorphic; however, most 
      of the SNPs in non-polymorphic residues were conserved except the residue at
      position 395. Nevertheless, no mutation was found in the DII loop of the Iranian 
      PfAMA1, indicating that it is subjected to purifying selection. In conclusion,
      the low genetic diversity in PfAMA1 among Iranian isolates supports and provides 
      valuable information for the development of a PfAMA1-based malaria vaccine.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared to expert malaria microscopy, malaria biomarkers such as
      Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2), and PCR provide
      superior analytical sensitivity and specificity for quantifying malaria parasites
      infections. This study reports on parasite prevalence, sick visits parasite
      density and species composition by different diagnostic methods during a phase-I 
      malaria vaccine trial. METHODS: Blood samples for microscopy, PfHRP-2 and
      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) ELISAs and real time quantitative PCR
      (qPCR) were collected during scheduled (n = 298) or sick visits (n = 38) from 30 
      adults participating in a 112-day vaccine trial. The four methods were used to
      assess parasite prevalence, as well as parasite density over a 42-day period for 
      patients with clinical episodes. RESULTS: During scheduled visits, qPCR (39.9%, N
      = 119) and PfHRP-2 ELISA (36.9%, N = 110) detected higher parasite prevalence
      than pLDH ELISA (16.8%, N = 50) and all methods were more sensitive than
      microscopy (13.4%, N = 40). All microscopically detected infections contained P. 
      falciparum, as mono-infections (95%) or with P. malariae (5%). By qPCR, 102/119
      infections were speciated. P. falciparum predominated either as monoinfections
      (71.6%), with P. malariae (8.8%), P. ovale (4.9%) or both (3.9%). P. malariae
      (6.9%) and P. ovale (1.0%) also occurred as co-infections (2.9%). As expected,
      higher prevalences were detected during sick visits, with prevalences of 65.8%
      (qPCR), 60.5% (PfHRP-2 ELISA), 21.1% (pLDH ELISA) and 31.6% (microscopy). PfHRP-2
      showed biomass build-up that climaxed (1813+/-3410 ng/mL SD) at clinical
      episodes. CONCLUSION: PfHRP-2 ELISA and qPCR may be needed for accurately
      quantifying the malaria parasite burden. In addition, qPCR improves parasite
      speciation, whilst PfHRP-2 ELISA is a potential predictor for clinical disease
      caused by P. falciparum. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00666380.

AB  - In clinical laboratories, diagnosis of imported malaria is commonly performed by 
      microscopy. However, the volume of specimens is generally low and maintaining
      proficiency in reading blood smears, particularly at the species level, is
      challenging in this setting. To address this problem, the Provincial Laboratory
      for Public Health (ProvLab) in Alberta, Canada, implemented real-time PCR for
      routine confirmation of all smear-positive samples in the province. Here we
      report our experience over a 4-year period (2008 to 2012) with this new
      diagnostic algorithm. While detection of Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy
      alone was accurate, real-time PCR served as an important adjunct to microscopy
      for the identification of non-falciparum species. In 18% of cases, the result was
      reported as non-falciparum or the species could not be identified by microscopy
      alone, and in all cases, the species was resolved by real-time PCR. In another 4%
      of cases, the species was misidentified by microscopy. To enhance surveillance
      for malaria, we integrated our demographic, clinical, and laboratory data into a 
      new system developed by the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence,
      called the Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS). Using this application, 
      we characterized our patient populations and travel history to identify risk
      factors associated with malaria infection abroad.
