TI Influence of the pfmdr1 Gene on In Vitro Sensitivities of Piperaquine in
   Thai Isolates of Plasmodium falciparum
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Piperaquine combined with dihydroartemisinin is one of the artemisinin derivative combination therapies, which can replace artesunate-mefloquine in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro sensitivity of Thai Plasmodium falciparum isolates against piperaquine and the influence of the pfmdr1 gene on in vitro response. One hundred and thirty-seven standard laboratory and adapted Thai isolates of P. falciparum were assessed for in vitro piperaquine sensitivity. Polymorphisms of the pfmdr1 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction methods. The mean and standard deviation of the piperaquine IC50 in Thai isolates of P. falciparum were 16.7 +/- 6.3 nM. The parasites exhibiting chloroquine IC50 of >= 100 nM were significantly less sensitive to piperaquine compared with the parasite with chloroquine IC50 of < 100 nM. No significant association between the pfmdr1 copy number and piperaquine IC50 values was found. In contrast, the parasites containing the pfmdr1 86Y allele exhibited significantly reduced piperaquine sensitivity. Before nationwide implementation of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as the first-line treatment in Thailand, in vitro and in vivo evaluations of this combination should be performed especially in areas where parasites containing the pfmdr1 86Y allele are predominant such as the Thai-Malaysian border.

TI Naturally Acquired Antibody Responses to a Synthetic Malaria Antigen
   AS202.11
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Background. A major challenge to malaria vaccine development is identification of protective epitopes and respective protective immune responses. Objective. To characterize naturally acquired Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to the synthetic peptide AS202.11, a malaria vaccine candidate. Methodology. This community based cross-sectional study enrolled 320 participants aged 1 year and above. Demographic information was recorded through interviews. Detection of P. falciparum infection was done by microscopy, malaria rapid diagnostic test, and polymerase chain reaction. ELISA was used to detect IgG antibody. Data was analyzed using STATA. Results. The overall AS202.11 IgG seropositivity was 78.8% (73.9-82.9). Seropositivity by age categorieswas <= 12 years [74.3% (67.4-80.2)], 13-40 years [85.3% (76.5-91.1)], and > 40 years [82.6% (68.7-91.1)]. Compared to the <= 12-year-old group, aORs for the other groups were 2.22 (1.14-4.32), P = 0.019, and 1.87 (0.81-4.35), P = 0.143, for the 13-40-year-old and > 40-year-old groups, respectively. The 13-40-year-old group had more seropositive individuals compared to the <= 12-year-old group. Conclusion. We report a high degree of recognition of AS202.11 by IgG elicited by field P. falciparum strains, suggesting its close similarity to native P. falciparum antigens and possible suitability of the peptide as a future malaria vaccine candidate.

TI THE REAL McCOIL: A method for the concurrent estimation of the
   complexity of infection and SNP allele frequency for malaria parasites
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB As many malaria-endemic countries move towards elimination of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, effective tools for monitoring malaria epidemiology are urgent priorities. P. falciparum population genetic approaches offer promising tools for understanding transmission and spread of the disease, but a high prevalence of multi clone or polygenomic infections can render estimation of even the most basic parameters, such as allele frequencies, challenging. A previous method, COIL, was developed to estimate complexity of infection (COI) from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, but relies on monogenomic infections to estimate allele frequencies or requires external allele frequency data which may not available. Estimates limited to monogenomic infections may not be representative, however, and when the average COI is high, they can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Therefore, we developed THE REAL McCOIL, Turning HEterozygous SNP data into Robust Estimates of ALelle frequency, via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Complexity Of Infection using Likelihood, to incorporate polygenomic samples and simultaneously estimate allele frequency and COI. This approach was tested via simulations then applied to SNP data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three Ugandan sites with varying malaria transmission. We show that THE REAL McCOIL consistently outperforms COIL on simulated data, particularly when most infections are polygenomic. Using field data we show that, unlike with COIL, we can distinguish epidemiologically relevant differences in COI between and within these sites. Surprisingly, for example, we estimated high average COI in a peri-urban subregion with lower transmission intensity, suggesting that many of these cases were imported from surrounding regions with higher transmission intensity. THE REAL McCOIL therefore provides a robust tool for understanding the molecular epidemiology of malaria across transmission settings.

TI Multicenter Pivotal Clinical Trial of Urine Malaria Test for Rapid
   Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB The need to expand malaria diagnosis capabilities alongside policy requirements for mandatory testing before treatment motivates exploration of noninvasive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). We report the outcome of the first crosssectional, single-blind clinical performance evaluation of a urine malaria test (UMT) for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. Matched urine and finger-prick blood samples from participants >= 2 years of age with fever (axillary temperature of >= 37.5 degrees C) or with a history of fever in the preceding 48 h were tested with UMT and microscopy (as the gold standard). BinaxNOW (Pf and Pan versions) blood RDTs were done to assess relative performance. Urinalysis and rheumatoid factor (RF) tests were conducted to evaluate possible interference. Diagnostic performance characteristics were computed at 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of 1,800 participants screened, 1,691 were enrolled; of these 566 (34%) were febrile, and 1,125 (66%) were afebrile. Among enrolled participants, 341 (20%) tested positive by microscopy, 419 (25%) were positive by UMT, 676 (40%) were positive by BinaxNOW Pf, and 368 (22%) were positive by BinaxNow Pan. UMT sensitivity among febrile patients (for whom the test was indicated) was 85%, and specificity was 84%. Among febrile children >= 5 years of age, UMT sensitivity was 93%, and specificity was 83%. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of UMT (0.84) was not significantly different from that of BinaxNOW Pf (0.86) or of BinaxNOW Pan (0.87), indicating that the tests do not differ in overall performance. Gender, seasons, and RF did not impact UMT performance. Leukocytes, hematuria, and urobilinogen concentrations in urine were associated with lower UMT specificities. UMT performance was comparable to that of the BinaxNOW Pf/ Pan tests, making UMT a promising tool to expand malaria testing in public and private health care settings where there are challenges to blood-based malaria diagnosis testing.

TI Molecular expression of aquaporin mRNAs in the northern house mosquito,
   Culex pipiens
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane-bound proteins, originally described as water-channels, that broadly exist in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. However, some AQPs can transport small molecules (e.g. urea, glycerol) along with or preferentially to water. Previous work in the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae have characterized the molecular expression of one or more AQP genes and shown that they are involved in water homeostasis after blood feeding, tolerance to dehydration and heat stresses, and development of Plasmodium falciparum in the mosquito. However, the molecular expression of AQPs in the northern house mosquito Culex pipiens, the primary vector of West Nile virus, is presently unknown. Here we characterize the relative mRNA expression of six AQP genes in C pipiens. We used quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) to compare AQP mRNA levels 1) among different life stages and sexes, 2) between blood fed and non-blood fed adult females, 3) between adult females injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and non-injected females, and 4) between adult females exposed to a low vs. high relative humidity. We found that: 1) four AQP mRNAs (Drip, Bib, Eglpl, Aqp12L) were differentially expressed between larval and adult life stages, but not between sexes; 2) after a blood meal, the expression of two AQP mRNAs (Drip and Aqp12L) were down-regulated and one AQP mRNA (Eglp2) was up-regulated; 3) the expression of two AQP mRNAs (Drip and Prip) were down-regulated and one AQP mRNA (Eglp1) was up regulated after injecting the hemolymph of mosquitoes with PBS; and 4) the expression of Prip and Eglp2 mRNAs were both down-regulated in response to a low relative humidity. Our study is the first to characterize the molecular expression patterns of AQPs in C pipiens, thus providing a foundation for future research elucidating the physiological and functional roles of AQPs in this important disease vector.

TI Uptake of Parasite-Derived Vesicles by Astrocytes and Microglial
   Phagocytosis of Infected Erythrocytes May Drive Neuroinflammation in
   Cerebral Malaria
SO GLIA
AB Astrocytes and microglia are activated during cerebral malaria (CM) and contribute to the production and release of several mediators during neuroinflammatory processes. Whether these changes are the consequence of a direct crosstalk between glial cells and the malarial parasite and how these cells participate in the pathogenesis of CM is not yet clear. We therefore examined the interaction of astrocytes and microglia with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected red blood cells using primary cell cultures derived from newborn C57BL/6 mice. We observed a dynamic transfer of vesicles from the parasite to astrocytes within minutes of contact, and the phagocytosis of infected red blood cells by microglia. Differential gene expression studies using the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) VR microarray, and quantitative PCR analyses showed the increase in expression of the set of genes belonging to the immune response network in parasite activated astrocytes and microglia. Interestingly, expression of these genes was also significantly upregulated in brains of mice dying from CM compared with uninfected mice or infected mice that did not develop the neuropathology. Accumulation of parasite-derived vesicles within astrocytes, and the phagocytosis of infected red blood cells by microglia induced a subsequent increase in interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (IP10) in both the brain and plasma of infected mice at the onset of CM, confirming a role for this molecule in CM pathogenesis. Altogether, these observations point to a possible role for glial cells in the neuropathological processes leading to CM.

TI Efficacy and safety of re-treatment with the same artemisinin-based
   combination treatment (ACT) compared with an alternative ACT and quinine
   plus clindamycin after failure of first-line recommended ACT (QUINACT):
   a bicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial
SO LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background Quinine or alternative artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) is the recommended rescue treatment for uncomplicated malaria. However, patients are often re-treated with the same ACT though it is unclear whether this is the most suitable approach. We assessed the efficacy and safety of re-treating malaria patients with uncomplicated failures with the same ACT used for the primary episode, compared with other rescue treatments.
   Methods This was a bicentre, open-label, randomised, three-arm phase 3 trial done in Lisungi health centre in DR Congo, and Kazo health centre in Uganda in 2012-14. Children aged 12-60 months with recurrent malaria infection after treatment with the first-line ACT were randomly assigned to either re-treatment with the same first-line ACT, an alternative ACT, which were given for 3 days, or quinine-clindamycin (QnC), which was given for 5-7 days, following a 2: 2: 1 ratio. Randomisation was done by computer-generated randomisation list in a block design by country. The three treatment groups were assumed to have equivalent efficacy above 90%. Both the research team and parents or guardians were aware of treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28, in the per-protocol population. This trial was registered under the numbers NCT01374581 in ClinicalTrials.gov and PACTR201203000351114 in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry.
   Findings From May 22, 2012, to Jan 31, 2014, 571 children were included in the trial. 240 children were randomly assigned to the re-treatment ACT group, 233 to the alternative ACT group, and 98 to the QnC group. 500 children were assessed for the primary outcome. 71 others were not included because they did not complete the follow-up or PCR genotyping result was not conclusive. The ACPR response was similar in the three groups: 91.4% (95% CI 87.5-95.2) for the re-treatment ACT, 91.3% (95% CI 87.4-95.1) for the alternative ACT, and 89.5% (95% CI 83.0-96.0) for QnC. The estimates for rates of malaria recrudescence in the three treatment groups were similar (log-rank test:. chi(2)=0.22, p=0.894). Artemether-lumefantrine was better tolerated than QnC (p=0.0005) and artesunate-amodiaquine (p<0.0001) in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. No serious adverse events were observed. The most common adverse events reported in the re-treatment ACT group were anorexia (31 [13%] of 240 patients), asthenia (20 [8%]), coughing (16 [7%]), abnormal behaviour (13 [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 [5%]). Anorexia (13 [6%] of 233 patients) was the most frequently reported adverse event in the alternative ACT group. The most commonly reported adverse events in the QnC group were anorexia (12 [12%] of 98 patients), abnormal behaviour (6 [6%]), asthenia (6 [6%]), and pruritus (5 [5%]).
   Interpretation Re-treatment with the same ACT shows similar efficacy as recommended rescue treatments and could be considered for rescue treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, the effect of this approach on the selection of resistant strains should be monitored to ensure that re-treatment with the same ACT does not contribute to P falciparum resistance.

TI The Power of Malaria Vaccine Trials Using Controlled Human Malaria
   Infection
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in healthy human volunteers is an important and powerful tool in clinical malaria vaccine development. However, power calculations are essential to obtain meaningful estimates of protective efficacy, while minimizing the risk of adverse events. To optimize power calculations for CHMI-based malaria vaccine trials, we developed a novel non-linear statistical model for parasite kinetics as measured by qPCR, using data from mosquito-based CHMI experiments in 57 individuals. We robustly account for important sources of variation between and within individuals using a Bayesian framework. Study power is most dependent on the number of individuals in each treatment arm; inter-individual variation in vaccine efficacy and the number of blood samples taken per day matter relatively little. Due to high inter-individual variation in the number of first-generation parasites, hepatic vaccine trials required significantly more study subjects than erythrocytic vaccine trials. We provide power calculations for hypothetical malaria vaccine trials of various designs and conclude that so far, power calculations have been overly optimistic. We further illustrate how upcoming techniques like needle-injected CHMI may reduce required sample sizes.

TI Critical Evaluation of Molecular Monitoring in Malaria Drug Efficacy
   Trials and Pitfalls of Length-Polymorphic Markers
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Estimation of drug efficacy in antimalarial drug trials requires parasite genotyping to distinguish new infections from treatment failures. When using length-polymorphic molecular markers, preferential amplification of short fragments can compromise detection of coinfections, potentially leading to misclassification of treatment outcome. We quantified minority clone detectability and competition among msp1, msp2, and glurp amplicons using mixtures of Plasmodium falciparum strains and investigated the impact of template competition on genotyping outcomes in 44 paired field samples. Substantial amplification bias was detected for all three markers, with shorter fragments outperforming larger fragments. The strongest template competition was observed for the marker glurp. Detection of glurp fragments in multiclonal infections was severely compromised. Eight of 44 sample pairs were identified as new infections by all three markers. Ten pairs were defined as new infections based on one marker alone, seven of which were defined by the questionable marker glurp. The impact of size-dependent template competition on genotyping outcomes therefore calls for necessary amendments to the current WHO recommendations for PCR correction of malaria drug trial endpoints. Accuracy of genotyping outcomes could be improved by separate amplification reactions per allelic family and basing results on markers msp1 and msp2 first, with glurp only used to resolve discordant results.

TI Absence of Asymptomatic Malaria Infection in a Cross-sectional Study in
   Iranshahr District, Iran under Elimination Programmes
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: Asymptomatic malaria infection provides a reservoir of parasites, causing the persistence of malaria transmission. It accounts an important challenge for successful management of the control, elimination, and eradication programmes in any malaria-endemic region. This investigation was designed to assess the presence and the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in Iranshahr district of Sistan and Baluchistan Province (2013-2014), with a considerable population movement, during the malaria elimination phase in Iran.
   Methods: Finger-prick blood samples were collected from symptomless (n=250) and febrile (n=50) individuals residing in Iranshahr district, easthern Iran (Hoodian, Mand, Chah-e Giji, Jolgehashem, Esfand, Dalgan and Chahshour) during Jan 2013 to Dec 2014, and Plasmodium infections were detected using light microscopic and highly sensitive nested-PCR techniques.
   Results: Thick and thin Giemsa-stained blood smears were negative for Plasmodium parasites. In addition, based on nested-PCR analysis, no P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae parasites were detected among the studied individuals.
   Conclusion: Investigation the absence of asymptomatic carriers in Iranshahr district was illustrated and achieving malaria elimination in this area is feasible in a near future.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, there were an estimated 214 million malaria cases and estimated 438.000 deaths occurred worldwide, in 2015. It is observed that 90% of all the deaths due to malaria occur in Africa. 78% of these cases were children who are under five years old. Intensive malaria interventions helped to reduce malaria incidence by 37% between 2000 and 2015. Malaria is a curable disease if diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly. Drug resistance has developed against almost all anti-malarial drugs and an effective vaccine against malaria has not been developed yet. Vaccine studies initiated 40 years ago by sterile immunity against falciparum malaria through immunization by exposure to 1000 irradiated mosquitoes. Complex structures, complicated life cycles and various antigenic structures of Plasmodium species make vaccination studies difficult. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the most extensively studied protein is also present in the content of the vaccine candidate RTS,S which is currently closest to get license. CSP was the first described Plasmodium antigen because of its important role during initiation of the parasitic infection. CSP is the major surface coat protein of Plasmodium parasite. CSP is a soluble protein and recombinant form of the CSP can be produced in Escherichia coli. NANP repeat region is a target site for host antibodies. Recently many DNA, RNA and protein vaccine candidates are being developed against malaria. According to WHO, in the next 20 years period, malaria vaccine can be developed. In this study we aimed to produce recombinant CSP (rCSP). Initially, P.falciparum CSP gene was amplified by PCR. CSP gene was cloned in to the pJET cloning vector. The gene subcloned to the pET100 protein expression vector. E.coli cells were used for protein expression. After this process, purification and endotoxin removal protocols were performed. As a result, 1182 bp CSP gene was obtained from P.falciparum genomic DNA. Accuracy of cloning and DNA sequence of the CSP gene was determined with DNA sequence analysis. The gene sequence was recorded to the GenBank with a registration no KT315396. rCSP was expressed in E.coli cells. The existence of rCSP was verified with Western Blot method and was purified and removed from endotoxins. rCSP aminoacid sequence and 3D shape was obtained. We believe that the production of recombinant CSP will enable us to contribute to the further malaria vaccine studies in our laboratory and country.

TI Malaria Parasitemia and Parasite Density in Antiretroviral-Treated
   HIV-Infected Adults Following Discontinuation of Cotrimoxazole
   Prophylaxis
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Cotrimoxazole (CTX) discontinuation increases malaria incidence in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Rates, quantity, and timing of parasitemia rebound following CTX remain undefined.
   Methods. Serial specimens from a trial of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) randomized to continue (the CTX arm) or discontinue (the STOP-CTX arm) were examined for malaria parasites by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specimens obtained at enrollment and then quarterly for 12 months and at sick visits were assessed; multiplicity of infection was evaluated by PCR that targeted the polymorphic msp-1/msp-2 alleles.
   Results. Among 500 HIV-infected adults receiving ART (median ART duration, 4.5 years), 5% had detectable parasitemia at baseline. After randomization, parasite prevalence increased over time in the STOP-CTX arm, compared with the CTX arm, with values of 4% and < 1%, respectively, at month 3, 8% and 2% at month 6, 14% and 2% at month 9, and 22% and 4% at month 12 (P =.0034). The combined mean parasite density at the various time points was higher in the STOP-CTX arm (4.42 vs 3.13 log(10) parasites/mL; P <.001). The parasitemia incidence was 42.0 cases per 100 person-years in the STOP-CTX arm and 9.9 cases per 100 person-years in the CTX arm, with an incidence rate ratio of 4.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.7-7.1; P <.001). After enrollment, mixed infections (multiplicity of infection, > 1) were only present in the STOP-CTX arm.
   Conclusion. Discontinuation of CTX by HIV-infected adults receiving ART resulted in progressive increases in malaria parasitemia prevalence and burden.

TI Laboratory Diagnosis of Malaria: Comparison of Manual and Automated
   Diagnostic Tests
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Malaria is the second most prevalent disease in Pakistan resulting in similar to 30,000 annual deaths. In endemic countries like Pakistan precise and timely diagnosis of malaria is imperative to overcome the associated risks of fatal outcomes. Malarial parasite was screened in 128 malaria suspected patients and 150 healthy controls, by species-specific PCR, microscopy of blood smears, hemoanalyzer Sysmex XE-2100, and rapid test devices (First Response Malaria (R) and ICT Malaria Combo (R)). The microscopy detected MP in 126 samples (parasite load/mu l 386-53712/mu l); 71.094% were infected with Plasmodium vivax and 14.844% with P falciparum while 14.062% had mixed P vivax and P falciparum infection. The mean parasite load for P vivax and P falciparum was 14496/4 and 24410/41, respectively. The abnormal scattergrams of DIFF, WBC/Baso, IMI channel, and RET-EXT on Sysmex XE2100 supported 99.2% parasite detection, whereas only 93% of confirmed malaria cases were detected by both rapid tests. About 127 samples were positive by PCR. Since Sysmex XE-2100 automatically detected the presence of malarial parasite with high sensitivity, it can be a good option for presumptive diagnosis in endemic areas. Microscopy remains the gold standard to confirm MP in suspected patients. Rapid diagnostic tests have acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

TI Submicroscopic and Asymptomatic Congenital Infection by Plasmodium vivax
   or P. falciparum in Colombia: 37 Cases with Placental Histopathology and
   Cytokine Profile in Maternal and Placental Blood
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Problem. Congenital plasmodial infection (CPI) is a rare event, which has been little studied in Colombia. Objective. To measure the frequency of CPI and to describe the immune and histological characteristics in maternal blood and placentas when CPI occurs. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out in northwest Colombia. A sample size of 39 unit analysis (a unit of analysis corresponds to the cord, placenta, and peripheral blood of a pregnant woman) was calculated using epidemiological and statistical parameters. Thick blood smear (TBS) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used as diagnostic tests. Results and Conclusions. A total of 137 parturient women were studied. All cases of CPI were submicroscopic (TBS negative and qPCR positive) and asymptomatic infections. If the definition of CPI considers only detection of parasites in umbilical cord blood, regardless of what was found in peripheral or placental blood, the frequency of CPI was 27%. However, if that definition is stricter and includes simultaneous detection of parasites in maternal or placental blood with the same species, the frequency of CPI in this study was 13%.

TI Molecular Evidence of Malaria and Zoonotic Diseases among Rapid
   Diagnostic Test-Negative Febrile Patients in Low-Transmission Season,
   Mali
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB From November to December 2012 in Selingue-Mali, blood samples from 88 febrile patients who tested negative by malaria Paracheck (R) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were used to assess the presence of sub-RDT Plasmodium falciparum as well as Borrelia, Coxiella burnetii, and Babesia applying molecular tools. Plasmodium sp. was present among 57 (60.2%) of the 88 malaria RDT-negative patients, whereas the prevalence of Borrelia, C. burnetii, and Babesia were 3.4% (N = 3), 1.1% (N = 1), and 0.0%, respectively. The additional diagnostic use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified a high proportion of Plasmodium sp.-positive samples and although this may be a concern for malaria control, the respective PCR-identified malaria infections were less likely responsible for the observed fevers given the low parasite density. Also, the low infection levels of Borrelia and C. burnetii and lack of Babesia among the febrile patients call for further studies to assess the causes of fever among malaria RDT-negative patients in Selingue.

TI Vitamin A and Zinc Supplementation among Pregnant Women to Prevent
   Placental Malaria: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial
   in Tanzania
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Vitamin A and zinc are important for immune function and may improve host defense against malaria and reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our objective was to determine whether daily oral supplementation with either or both nutrients starting in the first trimester reduces the risk of placental malaria and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We undertook a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a factorial design among 2,500 human immunodeficiency virus-negative primigravid or secundigravid pregnant women in their first trimester of pregnancy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We randomly allocated equal numbers of participants to 2,500 IU of vitamin A, 25 mg of zinc, both 2,500 IU of vitamin A and 25 mg of zinc, or a placebo until delivery. A total of 625 participants were allocated to each treatment group. Our primary outcome, placental malaria infection (past or current), was assessed in all randomized participants for whom placental samples were obtained at delivery (N = 1,404), which represents 56% of total participants and 62% of all pregnancies lasting 28 weeks or longer (N = 2,266). Birth outcomes were obtained for 2,434 of the 2,500 randomized participants. Secondary outcomes included small for gestational age (SGA) births and prematurity. All analyses were intent to treat. Those who received zinc had a lower risk of histopathology-positive placental malaria compared with those who did not receive zinc (risk ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval = 0.44, 0.91), but neither nutrient had an effect on polymerase chain reaction-positive malaria, SGA, or prematurity. No safety concerns were identified. We recommend additional studies in other geographic locations to confirm these findings.

TI A Malaria-Resistant Phenotype with Immunological Correlates in a
   Tanzanian Birth Cohort Exposed to Intense Malaria Transmission
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Malaria incidence is highly heterogeneous even in areas of high transmission, although no conclusive evidence exists that innate or naturally acquired resistance can prevent infection over an extended period of time. This longitudinal study examined immunoparasitological evidence for a malaria-resistant phenotype in which children do not develop malaria despite an extended period of exposure to parasites. Within a birth cohort followed from 2002 to 2006 in Muheza, Tanzania, an area of intense transmission, children (N = 687) provided blood smears biweekly during infancy and monthly thereafter. Maternal and childhood characteristics were obtained, cord-blood cytokines were measured, and antibody responses were assayed as measures of stage-specific exposure. Sixty-three (9.2%) children had no blood smear-positive slides over 2 years of follow-up (range: 1-3.5 years) and were identified as malaria resistant. Malaria-resistant children were similar to other children with respect to completeness of follow-up and all maternal and childhood characteristics except residence area. Antibody seroprevalence was similar for two sporozoite antigens, but malaria-resistant children had a lower antibody seroprevalence to merozoite antigens merozoite surface protein 1 (5.4% versus 30.2%; P < 0.0001) and apical membrane antigen 1 (7.2% versus 33.3%; P < 0.0001). Malaria-resistant children had higher cytokine levels in cord blood, particularly interleukin-1 beta. In summary, a subset of children living in an area of intense transmission was exposed to malaria parasites, but never developed patent parasitemia; this phenotype was associated with a distinct cytokine profile at birth and antibody profile during infancy. Further research with malaria-resistant children may identify mechanisms for naturally acquired immunity.

TI In vitro sensitivity to antimalarial drugs and polymorphisms in Pfg377
   gene in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Mewat, India
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB The malaria infection is the interplay of several complex factors, among which drug resistance and gametocyte biology are the crucial ones. Measurements of the drug sensitivity assays and prevalence of gametocyte genes play a major role in malaria eradication programmes. The purpose of this study was to assess the current drug sensitivity profile in the field isolates and type the Pfg377 gene. In vitro drug sensitivity assay was used to assess the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates collected from Mewat (Haryana), located in Northern region of India to four anti-malarial drugs. The inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the four drugs viz Chloroquine (CQ), Artesunate (AS), Sulphadoxine (SD) and Pyrimethamine (PYR) were in the range of 10.11-113.2, 2.26-4.08, 13.31-43.91 and 0.76-4.91 nM respectively in the evaluated 25 field isolates. The Pfg377 allele typing in the 26 field isolates revealed different types of haplotypes (A, B, C and D) varying by the size and number of repeats and deletions. The Pfg377 allelic types in the cryopreserved and adapted isolates of P. falciparum were compared to determine the parasite lines in them. The allele types or presence of different clones in the same sample could not be correlated significantly with resistance to any of the four drugs tested in the study. Our study revealed different drug sensitivity profiles of field isolates from Mewat region and allele typing of Pfg377 gene revealed different haplotypes of field isolates were circulating in parasite population.

TI Development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification with Plasmodium
   falciparum unique genes for molecular diagnosis of human malaria
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB In order to achieve better outcomes for treatment and in the prophylaxis of malaria, it is imperative to develop a sensitive, specific, and accurate assay for early diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection, which is the major cause of malaria. In this study, we aimed to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with P. falciparum unique genes for sensitive, specific, and accurate detection of P. falciparum infection. The unique genes of P. falciparum were randomly selected from PlasmoDB. The LAMP primers of the unique genes were designed using PrimerExplorer V4. LAMP assays with primers from unique genes of P. falciparum and conserved 18S rRNA gene were developed and their sensitivity was assessed. The specificity of the most sensitive LAMP assay was further examined using genomic DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium yoelii and Toxoplasma gondii. Finally, the unique gene-based LAMP assay was validated using clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. A total of 31 sets of top-scored LAMP primers from nine unique genes were selected from the pools of designed primers. The LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was the most sensitive with the detection limit 5 parasites/l, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the genomic DNA samples of P. vivax, P. yoelii, and T. gondii. The LAMP assay with PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) was less sensitive with the detection limit 50 parasites/l, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the genomic DNA samples of P. yoelii and T. gondii, but displayed positive LAMP detection with P. vivax. The positive detection rate of the LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was 90% (27/30), higher than that (80%, 24/30) of the positive rate of PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) in examining clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. The LAMP assay with the primer set PF3D7_1253300-5 was more sensitive, specific, and accurate than those with PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) in examining P. falciparum infection, and therefore it is a promising tool for diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.

TI Can Mixed Parasite Infections Thwart Targeted Malaria Elimination
   Program in India?
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB India is highly endemic to malaria with prevalence of all five species of human malaria parasites of Plasmodium genus. India is set for malaria elimination by 2030. Since cases of mixed Plasmodium species infections remain usually undetected but cause huge disease burden, in order to understand the distributional prevalence of both monospecies infections and mixed species infections in India, we collated published data on the differential infection incidences of the five different malaria parasites based on PCR diagnostic assay. About 11% of total cases were due to mixed species infection. Among several interesting observations on both single and mixed parasitic infections, incidences of Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection were found to be significantly higher than P. vivax monoinfection. Also, P. malariae seems to be emerging as a potential malaria threat in India. Putting all the facts together, it appears that the dream of achieving malaria elimination in India will not be completely successful without dealing with mixed species infection.

TI Molecular Markers for Sensitive Detection of Plasmodium falciparum
   Asexual Stage Parasites and their Application in a Malaria Clinical
   Trial
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Plasmodium falciparum parasite life stages respond differently to antimalarial drugs. Sensitive stagespecific molecular assays may help to examine parasite dynamics at microscopically detectable and submicroscopic parasite densities in epidemiological and clinical studies. In this study, we compared the performance of skeleton-binding protein 1 (SBP1), ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, Hyp8, ring-exported protein 1 (REX1), and PHISTb mRNA for detecting ring-stage trophozoite-specific transcripts using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Markers were tested on tightly synchronized in vitro parasites and clinical trial samples alongside established markers of parasite density (18S DNA and rRNA) and gametocyte density (Pfs25 mRNA). SBP1 was the most sensitive marker but showed low-level expression in mature gametocytes. Novel markers REX1 and PHISTb showed lower sensitivity but higher specificity for ring-stage trophozoites. Using in vivo clinical trial samples from gametocyte-negative patients, we observed evidence of persisting trophozoite transcripts for at least 14 days postinitiation of treatment. It is currently not clear if these transcripts represent viable parasites that may have implications for clinical treatment outcome or transmission potential.

TI Abundance, composition and natural infection of Anopheles mosquitoes
   from two malaria-endemic regions of Colombia
SO BIOMEDICA
AB Introduction: In Colombia, there are three Anopheles species implicated in malaria transmission as primary vectors; however, the local role of some Anopheles species still must be defined.
   Objective: To determine the abundance, composition and natural infection rates for mosquitoes Anopheles with Plasmodium spp. in two malaria-endemic regions of Colombia.
   Materials and methods: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected, using the human landing catches and while resting in livestock corrals, in nine endemic localities of two malaria-endemic regions of Colombia. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified and confirmed by PCR-RFLP-ITS2. Identified mosquitoes were processes and tested for Plasmodium parasite infection by ELISA and ssrRNA-based nested PCR.
   Results: A total of 1,963 Anopheles mosquitoes corresponding to nine species were collected. The most abundant species were Anopheles nuneztovari (53.5%) and A. darlingi (34.5%), followed by A. triannulatus s.l. (6%), and other species (approximate to 5.9%). Three species were naturally infected with Plasmodium spp., A. darlingi, A. nuneztovari and A. triannulatus s. l.
   Conclusions: Natural infection of A. darlingi and A. nuneztovari indicate that these main malaria vectors continue to be effective carriers of the Plasmodium parasite in the studied localities of the departments of Valle del Cauca and Choco. Additionally, the infected A. triannulatus s. l. collected in livestock corrals in the locality of the department of Cordoba, suggests the need for further studies to define the epidemiological importance of this species, on behalf of its abundance and opportunistic anthropophilic behavior.

TI Risk of daytime transmission of malaria in the French Guiana rain forest
SO MEDECINE ET SANTE TROPICALES
AB Between 2008 and 2014, there were 1070 malaria cases reported in French Guiana among members of the armed forces. Most of the malaria outbreaks investigated were multifactorial and followed missions conducted at illegal gold mining sites. For example, a malaria outbreak occurred in September 2013, three weeks after the deployment of 15 soldiers at Dagobert, which is such a site. The attack rate was 53%, with seven Plasmodium vivax infections and one coinfection with both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. Two months later, an entomological investigation in the field caught 321 anopheles by the human landing catch method. Among them, 282 were Anopheles darlingi. One specimen was PCR-positive for P. vivax, for an infection rate of 0.4% (1/282). In 15.7% of these cases, the An. darlingi was caught during the day. The existence of daytime biting activity by An. darlingi in the Guianese forest might play a key role in malaria outbreaks among military personnel. This finding requires that the Army Health Service adapt its recommendations concerning malaria prevention in French Guiana.

TI Diagnostic potential of monoclonal antibodies developed against
   C-terminal polypeptide of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein2 (PfHRP2)
   in malaria infected patients from India
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum has become a major health burden in most tropical and developing countries. P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein2 (PfHRP2), which exhibits polymorphism, is being widely used as a diagnostic marker. Recently, we reported the development of monoclonal antibodies against conserved C-terminal 105 amino acids of PfHRP2 for malaria diagnosis. Now, in this study, the diagnostic performance of two anti-C-terminal PfHRP2 mAbs (b10c1 and Aa3c10) were evaluated with 100 blood samples from clinically identified malaria patients from seven different geographical centers in India. Sandwich ELISA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and statistical tools were used for the evaluation of the performance of the anti-C-terminal PfHRP2 mAb. These mAbs detected P. falciparum (mean OD value 1.525 +/- 0.56) malaria with great accuracy with no cross reactivity with P. Plasmodium vivax (mean OD value 0.285 +/- 0.051) and normal healthy control samples (mean OD value 0.185 +/- 0.06) in Sandwich ELISA assay. The samples which were RDT negative for P. falciparum were also reactive in Sandwich ELISA with mean OD value of (1.303 +/- 0.532). The amount of PfHRP2 antigen in the patients' blood sample was quantified and categorized into three distinct groups having the HRP2 antigen in high, intermediate and low amounts. The presence of Pfhrp2 gene was also confirmed by PCR analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of the mAb were found to be 95 and 96% respectively. These data strongly suggest that the anti-C-terminal PfHRP2 mAbs b10c1 and Aa3c10 have merits for improvising the existing malarial diagnostics.

TI Advances in Molecular Diagnosis of Malaria
SO ADVANCES IN CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, VOL 80
SE Advances in Clinical Chemistry
AB Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by five species of Plasmodium parasites. Accurate diagnosis of malaria plays an essential part in malaria control. With traditional diagnostic methodologies, malaria control programs have achieved remarkable success during the past decade, and are now heading toward malaria elimination in many areas. This new situation, however, calls for novel diagnostics with improved sensitivity, throughput, and reduced cost for active screening of malaria parasites, as all transfected individuals have to be identified in order to block transmission. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction of malaria, the requirement of diagnostic advances in the age of malaria elimination, and a comprehensive overview of the currently available molecular malaria diagnostics, ranging from well-known tests to platforms in early stages of evaluation. We also discussed several practical issues for the application of molecular tests in malaria identification.

TI Non-correlation between CRP and rapid diagnostic tests for malaria among
   rural population in Southern Uganda (Original research paper)
SO CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK AND HEALTH INTERVENTION
AB The correlation between CRP blood levels and clinical presentation of malaria or blood parasitemia diagnosed microscopically or by PCR is one of the most discussed topics in the field of tropical medicine and malaria diagnostics. In total, 650 patients from the Lake Victoria area, which is of high risk for malaria were included in this study. In patients with febrile episodes, CRP tests were done together with the RDT for malaria. In 239 cases with CRP positive malaria, only 119 (51%) showed RDT malaria positive. CRP does not correlate with proven RDT for malaria. Patients with fever due to infection caused by Pl. falciparum can be CRP negative and vice versa, CRP positive patients may have negative RDT for malaria.

TI Sustained High Cure Rate of Artemether-Lumefantrine against
   Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria after 8 Years of Its
   Wide-Scale Use in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB We assessed the temporal trend of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) cure rate after 8 years of its wide-scale use for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria from 2006 to 2014 in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Trend analysis was performed for four studies conducted in 2006, 2007-2008, 2012-2013, and 2014. Patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled, treated with standard AL regimen and followed-up for 3 (2006), 28 (2014), 42 (2012-2013), or 56 (2007-2008) days for clinical and laboratory evaluation. Primary outcome was day 28 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted cure rate across years from 2007 to 2014. Parasite clearance was slower for the 2006 and 2007-2008 cohorts with less than 50% of patients cleared of parasitemia on day 1, but was rapid for the 2012-2013 and 2014 cohorts. Day 28 PCR-adjusted cure rate was 168/170 (98.8%) (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.2-100), 122/127 (96.1%) (95% CI, 92.6-99.5), and 206/207 (99.5%) (95% CI, 98.6-100) in 2007-2008, 2012-2013, and 2014, respectively. There was no significant change in the trend of cure rate between 2007 and 2014 (chi(2)(trend) test = 0.06, P = 0.90). Pretreatment P. falciparum multidrug-resistant gene 1 (Pfmdr1) N86 prevalence increased significantly across years from 13/48 (27.1%) in 2006 to 183/213 (85.9%) in 2014 (P < 0.001), and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene (Pfcrt) K76 prevalence increased significantly from 24/47 (51.1%) in 2006 to 198/205 (96.6%) in 2014 (P < 0.001). The AL cure rate remained high after 8 years of its wide-scale use in Bagamoyo district for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria despite an increase in prevalence of pretreatment Pfmdr1 N86 and Pfcrt K76 between 2006 and 2014.

TI A Direct from Blood Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction
   Assay for Monitoring Falciparum Malaria Parasite Transmission in
   Elimination Settings
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB We describe a novel one-step reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (direct RT-PCR) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites that amplifies RNA targets directly from blood. We developed the assay to identify gametocyte-specific transcripts in parasites from patient blood samples, as a means of monitoring malaria parasite transmission in field settings. To perform the test, blood is added directly to a master mix in PCR tubes and analyzed by real-time PCR. The limit of detection of the assay on both conventional and portable real-time PCR instruments was 100 parasites/mL for 18S rRNA, and 1,000 parasites/mL for asexual (PFE0065W) and gametocyte (PF14_0367, PFGEXP5) mRNA targets. The usefulness of this assay in field studies was explored in samples from individuals living in a high-transmission region in Cameroon. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay compared with a standard two-step RT-PCR was 100% for 18S rRNA on both conventional and portable instruments. For PF14_0367, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 70.0%, respectively, on the conventional instrument and 78.6% and 90%, respectively, on the portable instrument. The concordance for assays run on the two instruments was 100% for 18S rRNA, and 79.2% for PF14_0367, with most discrepancies resulting from samples with low transcript levels. The results show asexual and sexual stage RNA targets can be detected directly from blood samples in a simple one-step test on a field-friendly instrument. This assay may be useful for monitoring malaria parasite transmission potential in elimination settings, where sensitive diagnostics are needed to evaluate the progress of malaria eradication initiatives.

TI Efficacy of Artesunate/Amodiaquine in the Treatment of Uncomplicated
   Malaria among Children in Ghana
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The declining efficacy of chloroquine in the early 2000s in Ghana led to its replacement with artesunate/amodiaquine (AS/AQ) combination as first-line drug for treating uncomplicated malaria in 2005. Since then efficacy studies have been ongoing in the country to provide continuous data on the efficacy of AS/AQ and other alternative antimalarials (artemether/lumefantrine and dihyroartemisinin/piperaquine combinations) introduced in 2008. In vivo AS/AQ efficacy studies were conducted between June and October 2014 among children aged 6 months to 14 years, in two sentinel sites representing the forest and coastal zones of the country. The 2009 World Health Organization protocol for monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy was used in these studies. The studies showed an overall cumulative polymerase chain reaction-corrected day 28 cure rate of 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.6-99.1): 97.7% (95% CI: 92.0-99.7) within the forest zone and 96.7% (95% CI: 90.7-99.3) within the coastal zone (P= 0.686). Prevalence of fever declined from 100% to < 4% after first day of treatment in both ecological zones. All children in the coastal zone had cleared parasites by day 2. Three children (3.2%) in the forest zone were parasitemic on day 2, whereas one child was parasitemic on day 3. Gametocytemia was absent in both zones after day 14, and mean hemoglobin concentration significantly increased from 10.3 g/dL (95% CI: 10.1-10.5) on day 0 to 11.8 g/dL (95% CI: 11.6-12.0) on day 28. We conclude that AS/AQ combination remains efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana.

TI Efficacy of Different Primaquine Regimens to Control Plasmodium
   falciparum Gametocytemia in Colombia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Treatment against Plasmodium falciparum malaria includes blood schizonticides to clear asexual parasites responsible for disease. The addition of gametocytocidal drugs can eliminate infectious sexual stages with potential for transmission and the World Health Organization recommends a single dose (SD) of primaquine (PQ) to this end. The efficacy of PQ at 0.75 mg/kg to suppress gametocytemia when administered in single or fractionated doses was evaluated. A clinical controlled study with an open-label design was executed; three groups of 20 subjects were studied sequentially. All subjects were treated with the standard dose of artemether-lumefantrine plus the total dose of 0.75 mg/kg of PQ administered (without previous G6PD testing) in three different ways: Group "0.75d-3" received 0.75mg/kg on day 3; Group "0.50d-1 + 0.25d-3" received 0.50 mg/kg on day 1 and 0.25 mg/kg on day 3; Group "0.25d-1,2,3" received 0.25 mg/kg on days 1, 2, and 3. Subjects were evaluated on days 1, 4, and 7 by thick smear microscopy and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the carriage of immature and mature gametocytes. There were no adverse events. The three schemes caused a marked reduction (75-85%) in prevalence of gametocytes on day 4 compared with day 1, but only the group that received 0.75 mg/kg on day 3 maintained the reduced gametocyte burden until day 7. None of the three treatments were able to clear gametocyte carriage on days 4 or 7, but the group that received the SD had the lowest prevalence of gametocytes (15%). Further studies are needed to establish a PQ regimen with complete efficacy against gametocytes.

TI Plasmodium Species Infecting Children Presenting with Malaria in Uganda
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Contributions of species other than Plasmodium falciparum to human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa are uncertain. We collected blood from children aged 6 months to 10 years diagnosed with malaria by Giemsa-stained blood smears (176 subjects) or histidine rich protein-2-based rapid diagnostic tests (323 subjects) in 2016; 50 samples from each of 10 sites across Uganda were studied to identify infecting species. Of 499 available samples, 474 demonstrated plasmodial infection by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 18S ribosomal RNA genes, including P. falciparum in 472, Plasmodium malariae in 22, Plasmodium ovale in 15, and Plasmodium vivax in four; 435 were pure P. falciparum, two did not contain P. falciparum, and the remainder were mixed infections including P. falciparum. The prevalence of nonfalciparum species varied geographically. Stratifying based on recent history of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides, nonfalciparum infections were seen in 27/189 (14.8%) samples from sites that received and 13/285 (4.6%) samples from sites that did not receive IRS since 2010 (P = 0.0013). Overall, 39/474 (8.2%) samples from individuals diagnosed with malaria included nonfalciparum infections. Thus, a substantial proportion of episodes of malaria in Uganda include infections with plasmodial species other than P. falciparum.

TI Prevalence of Clinical and Subclinical Plasmodium falciparum and
   Plasmodium vivax Malaria in Two Remote Rural Communities on the
   Myanmar-China Border
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Malaria infections may be symptomatic, leading to treatment, or "asymptomatic," typically detected through active surveillance, and not leading to treatment. Malaria elimination may require purging both types of infection. Using detection methods with different sensitivities, we conducted a cross-sectional study in two rural communities located along the border between China's Yunnan Province and Myanmar's Shan and Kachin States, to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria. In Mong Pawk, all infections detected were asymptomatic, and the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was 0.3%, 4.3%, 4.0%, and 7.8% by light microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR), and multiplexed real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively, and Plasmodium vivax prevalence was 0% by all detection methods. In Laiza, of 385 asymptomatic participants, 2.3%, 4.4%, and 12.2% were positive for P. vivax by microscopy, cPCR, and RT-PCR, respectively, and 2.3% were P. falciparum-positive only by RT-PCR. Of 34 symptomatic participants in Laiza, 32.4% were P. vivax-positive by all detection methods. Factors associated with infection included gender (males higher than females, P = 0.014), and young age group (5-17 age group compared with others, P = 0.0024). Although the sensitivity of microscopy was adequate to detect symptomatic infections, it missed the vast majority (86.5%) of asymptomatic infections. Although molecular detection methods had no advantage over standard microscopy or RDT diagnosis for clinically apparent infections, malaria elimination along the Myanmar-China border will likely require highly sensitive surveillance tools to identify asymptomatic infections and guide targeted screen-and-treat interventions.

TI Comparative Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum Resistance-Associated
   Genetic Polymorphisms in Parasites Infecting Humans and Mosquitoes in
   Uganda
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Controlling malaria in high transmission areas, such as much of sub-Saharan Africa, will require concerted efforts to slow the spread of drug resistance and to impede malaria transmission. Understanding the fitness costs associated with the development of drug resistance, particularly within the context of transmission, can help guide policy decisions to accomplish these goals, as fitness constraints might lead to decreased transmission of drug-resistant strains. To determine if Plasmodium falciparum resistance-mediating polymorphisms impact on development at different parasite stages, we compared the genotypes of parasites infecting humans and mosquitoes from households in Uganda. Genotypes at 14 polymorphic loci in genes encoding putative transporters (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and folate pathway enzymes (pfdhfr and pfdhps) were characterized using ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assays. In paired analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, prevalences of mutations at 12 loci did not differ significantly between parasites infecting humans and mosquitoes. However, compared with parasites infecting humans, those infecting mosquitoes were enriched for the pfmdr1 86Y mutant allele (P = 0.0001) and those infecting Anopheles gambiae s.s. were enriched for the pfmdr1 86Y (P = 0.0001) and pfcrt 76T (P = 0.0412) mutant alleles. Our results suggest modest directional selection resulting from varied fitness costs during the P. falciparum life cycle. Better appreciation of the fitness implications of drug resistance mediating mutations can inform optimal malaria treatment and prevention strategies.

TI Synthetic Antigens Derived from Plasmodium falciparum Sporozoite, Liver,
   and Blood Stages: Naturally Acquired Immune Response and Human Leukocyte
   Antigen Associations in Individuals Living in a Brazilian Endemic Area
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Peptide vaccine strategies using Plasmodium-derived antigens have emerged as an attractive approach against malaria. However, relatively few studies have been conducted with malaria-exposed populations from non-African countries. Herein, the seroepidemiological profile against Plasmodium falciparum of naturally exposed individuals from a Brazilian malaria-endemic area against synthetic peptides derived from vaccine candidates circumsporozoite protein (CSP), liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1), erythrocyte binding antigen-175 (EBA-175), and merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP-3) was investigated. Moreover, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1* and HLA-DQB1* were evaluated to characterize genetic modulation of humoral responsiveness to these antigens. The study was performed using blood samples from 187 individuals living in rural malaria-endemic villages situated near Porto Velho, Rondonia State. Specific IgG and IgM antibodies and IgG subclasses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and HLA-DRB1* and HLA-DQB1* low-resolution typing was performed by PCR-SSP. All four synthetic peptides were broadly recognized by naturally acquired antibodies. Regarding the IgG subclass profile, only CSP induced IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, which is an important fact given that the acquisition of protective immunity appears to be associated with the cytophilicity of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies. HLA-DRB1* 11 and HLA-DQB1* 7 had the lowest odds of responding to EBA-175. Our results showed that CSP, LSA-1, EBA, and MSP-3 are immunogenic in natural conditions of exposure and that anti-EBA antibody responses appear to be modulated by HLA class II antigens.

TI Performance of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the
   Identification of Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum Infection in
   Uganda
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Accurately identifying and targeting the human reservoir of malaria parasitemia is critical for malaria control, and requires a reliable and sensitive diagnostic method. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is increasingly used to diagnose submicroscopic parasitemia. Although most published studies report the sensitivity of LAMP compared with nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as >= 80%, they have failed to use a consistent, sensitive diagnostic as a comparator. We used cross-sectional samples from children and adults in Tororo, Uganda, a region with high but declining transmission due to indoor residual spraying, to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of pan-Plasmodium LAMP for detecting submicroscopic infections. We compared LAMP results targeting a mitochondrial DNA sequence conserved in all Plasmodium species, performed on DNA extracted from dried blood spots, to those of a gold standard quantitative PCR assay targeting the var gene acidic terminal sequence of Plasmodium falciparum (varATS qPCR), performed on DNA extracted from 200 mL of whole blood. Using LAMP and varATS qPCR increased the detection of parasitemia 2- to 5-fold, compared with microscopy. Among microscopy-negative samples, the sensitivity of LAMP was 81.5% for detecting infection >= 1 parasites/mL. However, low density infections were common, and LAMP failed to identify more than half of all infections diagnosed by varATS qPCR, performing with an overall sensitivity of 44.7% for detecting submicroscopic infections >= 0.01 parasites/mL. Thus, although the LAMP assay is more sensitive than microscopy, it missed a significant portion of the submicroscopic reservoir. These findings have important implications for malaria control, particularly in settings where low-density infections predominate.

TI Plasmodium spp. infection rates for some Anopheles spp. from Sifontes
   Municipality, Bolivar State, Venezuela
SO BOLETIN DE MALARIOLOGIA Y SALUD AMBIENTAL
AB Bolivar state represents the most important focus of malaria transmission in Venezuela, most malaria cases are related to gold-mining, especially in the Sifontes municipality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the rate of natural Plasmodium spp. infection in Anopheles spp. collected between September 2009 and January 2012 in Sifontes. Out of 1,633 Anopheles spp. collected, the most abundant species were An. darlingi Root (56.7%), An. Albitarsis Lynch Arribalzaga sensulato(30.6%) and An. nuneztovari Gabaldon s.l. (11.7%). All the mosquitoes were assayed individually by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sixty-five were positive for Plasmodium spp. An. albitarsis s.l. had the highest infection rate, 5.4% (27/499; 95% CI: 3.63-7.76), followed by An. darlingi with 4.0% (37/926; 95% CI: 2.86-5.45) and An. nuneztovari s.l. with 0.5% (1/191; 95% CI: 0.03-2.58). The overall infection rate was 3.9% (65/1,633; 95% CI: 3.105.0). The rates of infection by Plasmodium species in mosquitoes were 3.7% (61/1633) for P. vivax and 0.2% (4/1633) for P. falciparum. The results show that the species An. albitarsis s.l. increased its rate of infection by Plasmodium more than 3 times in ten years. This natural infection of the vectors by Plasmodium may explain the current epidemiological situation of the Sifontes municipality as not only would the transmission remain, it would also be promoted.

TI Clinical features of severe malaria: Protective effect of mixed
   plasmodial malaria
SO ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Objective: To investigate clinically severe malaria patients with Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and mixed species infections.
   Methods: This study was conducted at Dr. Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia, from December 2011 to May 2013. Twenty nine patients (mean age of 41 years, 22% female), who suffered from severe malaria according to World Health Organization criteria (major and minor) and other criteria based on previous studies, were selected by consecutive sampling. Blood samples were obtained at admission from peripheral blood for microscopic diagnostic, nested PCR and laboratory examination of blood chemistry. Laboratory results were compared between the groups and correlated to each other.
   Results: From 29 samples, eight (28%) were diagnosed as P. falciparum mono-infection, 12 (41%) as P. vivax mono-infection and nine (31%) as mixed infections, confirmed by PCR. Cerebral malaria occurred in P. falciparum or mixed species infection only. Parasitaemia was highest in P. falciparum mono-infection. Mean haemoglobin was significantly lower in P. falciparum than P. vivax infection (P = 0.01). Mean thrombocyte count (77 138/mu L) was low in all groups. Mean urea, creatinine, total and direct bilirubin were significantly higher in P. falciparum mono-infection compared to other groups, whereas aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase showed no significant differences. Parasitaemia was positively correlated with an increase in urea, creatinine, bilirubin and leucocytosis in all species.
   Conclusions: Both Plasmodium species can solely or in combination cause severe malaria. Mixed infection was generally more benign than P. falciparum mono-infection and seemed to have some protective effects.

TI Seasonal Variation in the Epidemiology of Asymptomatic Plasmodium
   falciparum Infections across Two Catchment Areas in Bongo District,
   Ghana
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Understanding the epidemiology of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections is critical for countries to move toward malaria elimination. Using different methods for parasite detection, we evaluated how seasonality, spatial location, and other factors affect the age-specific epidemiology of asymptomatic malaria in Bongo District, Ghana. Asymptomatic prevalence by microscopy decreased significantly from 42.5% at the end of the wet to 27.5% at the end of the dry season (P < 0.001). Using the 18S rRNA polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), all microscopy-negative samples were screened and prevalence of submicroscopic infections also decreased significantly from the wet (55.4%) to the dry (20.7%) season (P < 0.001). Combining detection methods, 74.4% and 42.5% of the population in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, had evidence of a P. falciparum infection. Interestingly in those > 20 years of age, we found evidence of infection in 64.3% of the population in the wet and 27.0% in the dry season. Using both microscopy and PCR, the asymptomatic P. falciparum reservoir peaks at the end of the wet season and infections in all age groups constitute the reservoir of malaria infection. At the end of the wet season, spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence and density of P. falciparum infections was observed between the two catchment areas surveyed in Bongo District. These results indicate that if elimination is to succeed, interventions will need to target not just P. falciparum infections in children but also in adults, and be implemented toward the end of the dry season in this area of West Africa.

TI Plasmodium vivax Infections over 3 Years in Duffy Blood Group Negative
   Malians in Bandiagara, Mali
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Plasmodium vivax was thought to infect only the erythrocytes of Duffy blood group positive people. In the last decade, P. vivax has appeared throughout Africa, both in areas where Duffy positive and negative people live side by side as in Madagascar and Ethiopia and in areas where people are primarily Duffy negative, such as in western Kenya. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction on blood samples dried onto filter paper to determine the prevalence of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in a cohort of 300 children (newborn to 6 years of age) in Bandiagara, a Sahelian area of Mali, west Africa, where the people are Duffy negative. We report 1-3 occurrences of P. vivax in each of 25 Duffy-negative children at six time points over two rainy seasons and the beginning of the third season. The prevalence of P. vivax infection was 2.0-2.5% at every time point (June 2009 to June 2010). All children with P. vivax infections were asymptomatic and afebrile, and parasite densities were extremely low. Anemia, however, was the main burden of infection. Plasmodium vivax could become a burden to sub-Saharan Africa, and the evidence of P. vivax existence needs to be taken into consideration in designing malaria control and elimination strategies in Africa.

TI Performance of a High-Sensitivity Rapid Diagnostic Test for Plasmodium
   falciparum Malaria in Asymptomatic Individuals from Uganda and Myanmar
   and Naive Human Challenge Infections
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Sensitive field-deployable diagnostic tests can assist malaria programs in achieving elimination. The performance of a new Alere (TM) Malaria Ag P.f Ultra Sensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) was compared with the currently available SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f RDT in blood specimens from asymptomatic individuals in Nagongera, Uganda, and in a Karen Village, Myanmar, representative of high-and low-transmission areas, respectively, as well as in pretreatment specimens from study participants from four Plasmodium falciparum-induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) studies. A quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for histidine-rich protein II (HRP2) were used as reference assays. The uRDT showed a greater than 10-fold lower limit of detection forHRP2compared with the RDT. The sensitivity of the uRDT was 84% and 44% against qRT-PCR in Uganda and Myanmar, respectively, and that of the RDT was 62% and 0% for the same two sites. The specificities of the uRDT were 92% and 99.8% against qRT-PCR for Uganda and Myanmar, respectively, and 99% and 99.8% against the HRP2 reference ELISA. The RDT had specificities of 95% and 100% against qRT-PCR for Uganda and Myanmar, respectively, and 96% and 100% against the HRP2 reference ELISA. The uRDT detected new infections in IBSM study participants 1.5 days sooner than the RDT. The uRDT has the same workflow as currently available RDTs, but improved performance characteristics to identify asymptomatic malaria infections. The uRDT may be a useful tool for malaria elimination strategies.

TI MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF PFMDRI GENE IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM IN
   THAI-CAMBODIA BORDER
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH
AB Background: Drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major problem for malaria control. Policy makers currently depend on in vivo and in vitro test to adjust antimalarial regimens for malaria treatment guideline. Methods: These two methods are required expertise for interpretation and time consuming. Therefore, the alternative reliable molecular markers of antimalarial resistance could also play an important role in the surveillance of drug efficacy. Pfmdrl gene has been shown to be a reliable marker of resistance for P. falciparum related to artesunate and mefloquine combination therapy. The propose of this study are to investigate the prevalence of P. falciparum multidrug resistance by determined Pfmdrl point mutations at codon N86Y, Y184F, S1034C by PCR-RFLP and investigated Pfmdrl copy number by using real-time quantitative PCR with TaqMan and compared to efficacy of ACTs (Artemisinine Combination Therapies). Results: Seventy-three infected blood samples were collected from the therapeutic efficacy of ACTs project tested in 2 provinces in malaria endemic areas of Thailand which are Chantaburi and Trat. The results showed that in Trat province exhibited the higher percentage of P. falciparum with three or more copies of Pfmdrl than in Chantaburi (27.27% and 0%, respectively). The mean of Pfmdrl copy number in P. falciparum collected from Trat and Chantaburi provinces were 2.2 and 1.5 respectively. In contrast, there was no mutation in Pfmdrl gene in P. falciparum from Trat whereas in Chantaburi found point mutation in N86Y (20%, n=15), S1034C (28.57%, n=7) and no mutation was found in Y184F both in P. falciparum collected from Trat and Chantaburi. Conclusion: These results were correlated to the ACTs efficacy test. Pfmdrl mutation and copy number may be used as a high throughput tool to investigate the role of drug resistance of malaria parasites in laboratory studies or large scale epidemiological surveys.

TI Genetic clustering and polymorphism of the merozoite surface protein-3
   of Plasmodium knowlesi clinical isolates from Peninsular Malaysia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been reported to cause significant numbers of human infection in South East Asia. Its merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP3) is a protein that belongs to a multi-gene family of proteins first found in Plasmodium falciparum. Several studies have evaluated the potential of P. falciparum MSP3 as a potential vaccine candidate. However, to date no detailed studies have been carried out on P. knowlesi MSP3 gene (pkmsp3). The present study investigates the genetic diversity, and haplotypes groups of pkmsp3 in P. knowlesi clinical samples from Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from P. knowlesi malaria patients within a period of 4 years (2008-2012). The pkmsp3 gene of the isolates was amplified via PCR, and subsequently cloned and sequenced. The full length pkmsp3 sequence was divided into Domain A and Domain B. Natural selection, genetic diversity, and haplotypes of pkmsp3 were analysed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programmes.
   Results: From 23 samples, 48 pkmsp3 sequences were successfully obtained. At the nucleotide level, 101 synonymous and 238 non-synonymous mutations were observed. Tests of neutrality were not significant for the full length, Domain A or Domain B sequences. However, the dN/dS ratio of Domain B indicates purifying selection for this domain. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed 42 different haplotypes. Neighbour Joining phylogenetic tree and haplotype network analyses revealed that the haplotypes clustered into two distinct groups.
   Conclusions: A moderate level of genetic diversity was observed in the pkmsp3 and only the C-terminal region (Domain B) appeared to be under purifying selection. The separation of the pkmsp3 into two haplotype groups provides further evidence of the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi types or lineages. Future studies should investigate the diversity of pkmsp3 among P. knowlesi isolates in North Borneo, where large numbers of human knowlesi malaria infection still occur.

TI Evidence of non-Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection in Kedougou,
   Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Expanded malaria control efforts in Senegal have resulted in increased use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) to identify the primary disease-causing Plasmodium species, Plasmodium falciparum. However, the type of RDT utilized in Senegal does not detect other malaria-causing species such as Plasmodium ovale spp., Plasmodium malariae, or Plasmodium vivax. Consequently, there is a lack of information about the frequency and types of malaria infections occurring in Senegal. This study set out to better determine whether species other than P. falciparum were evident among patients evaluated for possible malaria infection in Kedougou, Senegal.
   Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction speciation assays for P. vivax, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae were developed and validated by sequencing and DNA extracted from 475 Plasmodium falciparum-specific HRP2-based RDT collected between 2013 and 2014 from a facility-based sample of symptomatic patients from two health clinics in Kedougou, a hyper-endemic region in southeastern Senegal, were analysed.
   Results: Plasmodium malariae (n = 3) and P. ovale wallikeri (n = 2) were observed as co-infections with P. falciparum among patients with positive RDT results (n = 187), including one patient positive for all three species. Among 288 negative RDT samples, samples positive for P. falciparum (n = 24), P. ovale curtisi (n = 3), P. ovale wallikeri (n = 1), and P. malariae (n = 3) were identified, corresponding to a non-falciparum positivity rate of 2.5%.
   Conclusions: These findings emphasize the limitations of the RDT used for malaria diagnosis and demonstrate that non-P. falciparum malaria infections occur in Senegal. Current RDT used for routine clinical diagnosis do not necessarily provide an accurate reflection of malaria transmission in Kedougou, Senegal, and more sensitive and specific methods are required for diagnosis and patient care, as well as surveillance and elimination activities. These findings have implications for other malaria endemic settings where species besides P. falciparum may be transmitted and overlooked by control or elimination activities.

TI Usefulness of a biomarker to identify placental dysfunction in the
   context of malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB In most tropical areas, pregnant women are at increased risk of malaria, as a consequence of the massive sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the placenta. The placenta plays a key role in embryonic and fetal development as well as in maternal-fetal exchanges, and pregnancy-associated malaria may alter selected placenta functions that lead to stillbirth and low birth weight. Although there are several tools (blood smear examination, RDT, PCR) to diagnose malaria infection during pregnancy, there is currently no test to assess placenta dysfunction in the framework of pregnancy-associated malaria. Pregnancy-associated malaria shares many features with preeclampsia, an extensively studied disease. Various biomarkers associated with placental dysfunction have been identified as associated with preeclampsia. Several of these are inflammatory markers that lack of specificity. A few seem more specific of placenta dysfunction, including s-endoglin and sFlt1, increased in the peripheral blood during preeclampsia. The predictive value of these biomarkers should be studied in the context of pregnancy-associated malaria to evaluate their usefulness in identifying placental dysfunction during malaria. These biomarkers should be considered to improve the diagnosis of placental dysfunction during malaria and pregnant women monitoring.

TI Malaria epidemiology in central Myanmar: identification of a
   multi-species asymptomatic reservoir of infection
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a global health concern. Myanmar stands at the frontier of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum. Myanmar also has the highest reported malaria burden in Southeast Asia; it is integral in the World Health Organization's plan to eliminate malaria in Southeast Asia, yet few epidemiological data exist for the general population in Myanmar.
   Methods: This cross-sectional, probability household survey was conducted in Phyu township, Bago Region (central Myanmar), during the wet season of 2013. Interviewers collected clinical and behavioural data, recorded tympanic temperature and obtained dried blood spots for malaria PCR and serology. Plasmodium falciparum positive samples were tested for genetic mutations in the K13 region that may confer artemisinin resistance. Estimated type-specific malaria PCR prevalence and seroprevalence were calculated, with regression analysis to identify risk factors for seropositivity to P. falciparum. Data were weighted to account for unequal selection probabilities.
   Results: 1638 participants were sampled (500 households). Weighted PCR prevalence was low (n = 41, 2.5%) and most cases were afebrile (93%). Plasmodium falciparum was the most common species (n = 19. 1.1%) and five (26%) P. falciparum samples harboured K13 mutations. Plasmodium knowlesi was detected in 1.0% (n = 16) and Plasmodium vivax was detected in 0.4% (n = 7). Seroprevalence was 9.4% for P. falciparum and 3.1% for P. vivax. Seroconversion to P. falciparum was 0.003/year in the whole population, but 16-fold higher in men over 23 years old (LR test p = 0.016).
   Discussion: This is the first population-based seroprevalence study from central Myanmar. Low overall prevalence was discovered. However, these data suggest endemic transmission continues, probably associated with behavioural risk factors amongst working-age men. Genetic mutations associated with P. falciparum artemisinin resistance, the presence of P. knowlesi and discrete demographic risk groups present opportunities and challenges for malaria control. Responses targeted to working-age men, capable of detecting sub-clinical infections, and considering all species will facilitate malaria elimination in this setting.

TI LAMP kit for diagnosis of non-falciparum malaria in Plasmodium ovale
   infected patients
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Microscopy and rapid diagnosis tests have a limited sensitivity in diagnosis of malaria by Plasmodium ovale. The LAMP kit (LoopAMP (R)) can be used in the field without special equipment and could have an important role in malaria control programmes in endemic areas and for malaria diagnosis in returned travellers. The performance of the Pan primer of the kit in detecting malaria by P. ovale was compared with the results of standard nPCR in samples of patients returning from P. ovale endemic areas.
   Methods: Plasmodium ovale positive samples (29, tested by PCR and/or microscopy) and malaria negative specimens (398, tested by microscopy and PCR) were collected in different hospitals of Europe from June 2014 to March 2016 and frozen at -20 degrees C. Boil and spin method was used to extract DNA from all samples and amplification was performed with LoopAMP (R) MALARIA kit (Eiken Chemical, Japan) in an automated turbidimeter (Eiken 500). The results of LAMP read by turbidimetry and with the naked eye were compared.
   Results: The kit showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.24% with positive and negative predictive values of 72.5 and 100%, respectively. Naked eyed readings were in accordance with turbidimetry readings (sensitivity, 92.5%, specificity, 98.96% and positive and negative predictive values, respectively, 90.24 and 99.22%). The limit of detection of LAMP assay for P. ovale was between 0.8 and 2 parasites/mu l.
   Conclusions: The Pan primer of the Malaria kit LoopAMP (R) can detect P. ovale at very low-levels and showed a predictive negative value of 100%. This tool can be useful in malaria control and elimination programmes and in returned travellers from P. ovale endemic areas. Naked eye readings are equivalent to automated turbidimeter readings in specimens obtained with EDTA.

TI Absence of in vivo selection for K13 mutations after
   artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Uganda
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Individual drug treatment may select resistant parasites in the human body, a process termed in vivo selection. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) genes have been reportedly selected after artemether-lumefantrine treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding in vivo selection of P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain (pfkelch13) polymorphisms, responsible for artemisinin-resistance in Asia, and six putative background mutations for artemisinin resistance; D193Y in ferredoxin, T484I in multiple resistance protein 2, V127M in apicoplast ribosomal protein S10, I356T in pfcrt, V1157L in protein phosphatase and C1484F in phosphoinositide-binding protein.
   Methods: Artemether-lumefantrine efficacy study with a follow-up period of 28 days was conducted in northern Uganda in 2014. The above-mentioned genotypes were comparatively analysed before drug administration and on days; 3, 7, and 28 days after treatment.
   Results: In 61 individuals with successful follow-up, artemether-lumefantrine treatment regimen was very effective with PCR adjusted efficacy of 95.2%. Among 146 isolates obtained before treatment, wild-type alleles were observed in 98.6% of isolates in pfkelch13 and in all isolates in the six putative background genes except I356T in pfcrt, which had 2.4% of isolates as mixed infections. In vivo selection study revealed that all isolates detected in the follow-up period harboured wild type alleles in pfkelch13 and the six background genes.
   Conclusion: Mutations in pfkelch13 and the six background genes may not play an important role in the in vivo selection after artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Uganda. Different mechanisms might rather be associated with the existence of parasites after treatment.

TI Interferon-gamma responses to Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate
   antigens decrease in the absence of malaria transmission
SO PEERJ
AB Background. Malaria elimination campaigns are planned or active in many countries. The effects of malaria elimination on immune responses such as antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses are not well characterized.
   Methods. IFN-gamma responses to the P. falciparum antigens circumsporozoite protein, liver stage antigen-1, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein, apical membrane antigen-1, MB2, and merozoite surface protein-1 were tested by ELISA in 243 individuals in highland Kenya in April 2008, October 2008, and April 2009, after a one-year period of interrupted malaria transmission from April 2007 to March 2008. 3
   Results. While one individual (0.4%) tested positive for P. falciparum by PCR inOctober 2008 and another two (0.9%) tested positive in April 2009, no clinical malaria cases were detected during weekly visits. Levels of IFN-gamma to all antigens decreased significantly from April 2008 to April 2009 (all P < 0.001).
   Discussion. Naturally acquired IFN-gamma responses to P. falciparum anfigensare shortlived in the absence of repeated P. falciparum infection. Even short periods of malaria interruption may significantly decrease IFN-gamma responses to P. falciparum antigens.

TI African Non-Human Primates Host Diverse Enteroviruses
SO PLOS ONE
AB Enteroviruses (EVs) belong to the family Picornaviridae and are responsible for mild to severe diseases in mammals including humans and non-human primates (NHP). Simian EVs were first discovered in the 1950s in the Old World Monkeys and recently in wild chimpanzee, gorilla and mandrill in Cameroon. In the present study, we screened by PCR EVs in 600 fecal samples of wild apes and monkeys that were collected at four sites in Gabon. A total of 32 samples were positive for EVs (25 from mandrills, 7 from chimpanzees, none from gorillas). The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 and VP2 genes showed that EVs identified in chimpanzees were members of two human EV species, EV-A and EV-B, and those identified in mandrills were members of the human species EV-B and the simian species EV-J. The identification of two novel enterovirus types, EV-B112 in a chimpanzee and EV-B113 in a mandrill, suggests these NHPs could be potential sources of new EV types. The identification of EV-B107 and EV90 that were previously found in humans indicates cross-species transfers. Also the identification of chimpanzee-derived EV110 in a mandrill demonstrated a wide host range of this EV. Further research of EVs in NHPs would help understanding emergence of new types or variants, and evaluating the real risk of cross-species transmission for humans as well for NHPs populations.

TI Detection of Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
   vivax using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in a
   co-endemic area in Malaysia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium knowlesi is the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia. However, microscopic diagnosis is inaccurate and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are insufficiently sensitive. PCR is sensitive and specific but not feasible at a district level. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) shows potential with only basic requirements. A commercially available LAMP assay, the Eiken Loopamp (TM) MALARIA Pan Detection kit, is sensitive for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, but has not previously been evaluated for P. knowlesi. This study aims to determine the sensitivity of this LAMP assay for detecting P. knowlesi infection.
   Methods: Study participants included 73 uncomplicated malaria patients with PCR species confirmation: 50 P. knowlesi, 20 P. falciparum and 3 P. vivax. Nineteen malaria-negative, non-endemic area controls were also included. The sensitivity of the Eiken Loopamp (TM) MALARIA Pan Detection kit (Pan LAMP) for detecting each Plasmodium species was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of the Eiken Loopamp (TM) MALARIA Pf Detection kit (Pf LAMP) for P. falciparum were also determined. The limit of detection for each LAMP assay was evaluated, with results compared to PCR. All P. knowlesi patients were also tested by CareStart (TM) (Pf/VOM) and OptiMAL-IT (TM) (Pan/Pf) RDTs.
   Results: The sensitivity of the Pan LAMP assay was 100% for P. knowlesi (95% CI 92.9-100), P. falciparum (95% CI 83.2-100), and P. vivax (95% CI 29.2-100). The Pf LAMP was 100% sensitive and specific for P. falciparum detection, with all P. knowlesi samples having a negative reaction. LAMP sensitivity was superior to both RDTs, with only 10 and 28% of P. knowlesi samples testing positive to CareStart (TM) and OptiMAL-IT (TM), respectively. Limit of detection using the Pan LAMP for both P. knowlesi and P. vivax was 2 parasites/mu L, comparable to PCR. For P. falciparum both the Pan LAMP and Pf LAMP demonstrated a limit of detection of 20 parasites/mu L.
   Conclusions: The Eiken Loopamp (TM) MALARIA Pan Detection kit is sensitive for detection of P. knowlesi in low parasitaemia clinical infections, as well as P. falciparum and P. vivax. However, a P. knowlesi-specific field assay in a simpler format would assist correct species identification and initiation of optimal treatment for all malaria patients.

TI Direct detection of falciparum and non-falciparum malaria DNA from a
   drop of blood with high sensitivity by the dried-LAMP system
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Because of the low sensitivity of conventional rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria infections, the actual prevalence of the diseases, especially those caused by non-Plasmodium falciparum (non-Pf) species, in asymptomatic populations remain less defined in countries lacking in well-equipped facilities for accurate diagnoses. Our direct blood dry LAMP system (CZC-LAMP) was applied to the diagnosis of malaria as simple, rapid and highly sensitive method as an alternative for conventional RDTs in malaria endemic areas where laboratory resources are limited.
   Results: LAMP primer sets for mitochondria DNAs of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and human-infective species other than Pf (non-Pf; P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae) were designed and tested by using human blood DNA samples from 74 residents from a malaria endemic area in eastern Zambia. These malaria dry-LAMPs were optimized for field or point-of-care operations, and evaluated in the field at a malaria endemic area in Zambia with 96 human blood samples. To determine the sensitivities and specificities, results obtained by the on-site LAMP diagnosis were compared with those by the nested PCR and nucleotide sequencing of its product. The dry LAMPs showed the sensitivities of 89.7% for Pf and 85.7% for non-Pf, and the specificities of 97.2% for Pf and 100% for non-Pf, with purified blood DNA samples. The direct blood LAMP diagnostic methods, in which 1 mu l of anticoagulated blood were used as the template, showed the sensitivities of 98.1% for Pf, 92.1% for non-Pf, and the specificities of 98.1% for Pf, 100% for non-Pf. The prevalences of P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale in the surveyed area were 52.4, 25.3 and 10.6%, respectively, indicating high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in endemic areas in Zambia.
   Conclusions: We have developed new field-applicable malaria diagnostic tests. The malaria CZC-LAMPs showed high sensitivity and specificity to both P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum. These malaria CZC-LAMPs provide new means for rapid, sensitive and reliable point-of-care diagnosis for low-density malaria infections, and are expected to help update current knowledge of malaria epidemiology, and can contribute to the elimination of malaria from endemic areas.

TI Field Evaluation of a High Throughput Loop Mediated Isothermal
   Amplification Test for the Detection of Asymptomatic Plasmodium
   Infections in Zanzibar
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   New field applicable diagnostic tools are needed for highly sensitive detection of residual malaria infections in pre-elimination settings. Field performance of a high throughput DNA extraction system for loop mediated isothermal amplification (HTP-LAMP) was therefore evaluated for detecting malaria parasites among asymptomatic individuals in Zanzibar.
   Methods
   HTP-LAMP performance was evaluated against real-time PCR on 3008 paired blood samples collected on filter papers in a community-based survey in 2015.
   Results
   The PCR and HTP-LAMP determined malaria prevalences were 1.6% (95% CI 1.3-2.4) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.1), respectively. The sensitivity of HTP-LAMP compared to PCR was 40.8% (CI95% 27.0-55.8) and the specificity was 99.9% (CI95% 99.8-100). For the PCR positive samples, there was no statistically significant difference between the geometric mean parasite densities among the HTP-LAMP positive (2.5 p/mu L, range 0.2-770) and HTP-LAMP negative (1.4 p/mu L, range 0.1-7) samples (p = 0.088). Two lab technicians analysed up to 282 samples per day and the HTP-LAMP method was experienced as user friendly.
   Conclusions
   Although field applicable, this high throughput format of LAMP as used here was not sensitive enough to be recommended for detection of asymptomatic low-density infections in areas like Zanzibar, approaching malaria elimination.

TI Providing lipid-based nutrient supplement during pregnancy does not
   reduce the risk of maternal P falciparum parasitaemia and reproductive
   tract infections: a randomised controlled trial
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB Background: Maternal infections are associated with maternal and foetal adverse outcomes. Nutrient supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the occurrence of infections by improving maternal immunity. We aimed to investigate the impact of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement (SQ-LNS) on the occurrence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia during pregnancy and trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis and urinary tract infection (UTI) after delivery.
   Methods: Pregnant Malawian women enrolled in the iLiNS-DYAD trial receiving daily supplementation with SQ-LNS, multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron & folic acid (IFA) from <20 gestation weeks (gw) were assessed for P. falciparum parasitaemia at 32 gw using rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), at 36 gw using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and at delivery using both RDT and PCR; and at one week after delivery for trichomoniasis and vaginal candidiasis using wet mount microscopy and for UTI using urine dipstick analysis. The prevalence of each infection by intervention group was estimated at the prescribed time points and the global null hypothesis was tested using logistic regression. Adjusted analyses were performed using preselected covariates.
   Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was 10.7% at 32 gw, 9% at 36 gw, and 8.3% by RDT and 20.2% by PCR at delivery. After delivery the prevalence of trichomoniasis was 10.5%, vaginal candidiasis was 0.5%, and UTI was 3. 1%. There were no differences between intervention groups in the prevalence of any of the infections.
   Conclusion: In this population, SQ-LNS did not influence the occurrence of maternal P. falciparum parasitaemia, trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis or UTI.

TI Performance of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the
   diagnosis of malaria among malaria suspected pregnant women in Northwest
   Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is a major public health problem and an important cause of maternal and infant morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria with effective treatment is the best strategy for prevention and control of complications during pregnancy and infant morbidity and mortality. However, laboratory diagnosis has relied on the identification of malaria parasites and parasite antigens in peripheral blood using Giemsa-stained microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which lack analytical and clinical sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the diagnosis of malaria among malaria suspected pregnant women in Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from January to April 2016. Pregnant women (n = 87) suspected of having malaria at six health centres were enrolled. A venous blood sample was collected from each study subject, and analysed for Plasmodium parasites by microscopy, RDT, and LAMP. Diagnostic accuracy outcome measures (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Kappa scores) of microscopy, RDT and LAMP were compared to nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) as the gold standard. Specimen processing and reporting times were documented.
   Results: Using nPCR as the gold standard technique, the sensitivity of microscopy and RDT was 90 and 70%, and the specificity was 98.7 and 97.4%, respectively. LAMP assay was 100% sensitive and 93.5% specific compared to nPCR.
   Conclusions: This study showed higher sensitivity of LAMP compared to microscopy and RDT for the detection of malaria in pregnancy. Increased sensitivity and ease of use with LAMP in point-of-care testing for malaria in pregnancy was noted. LAMP warrants further evaluation in intermittent screening and treatment programmes in pregnancy.

TI Spatio-temporal analysis of the genetic diversity and complexity of
   Plasmodium falciparum infections in Kedougou, southeastern Senegal
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Genetic analyses of the malaria parasite population and its temporal and spatial dynamics could provide an assessment of the effectiveness of disease control strategies. The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been poorly documented in Senegal, and limited data are available from the Kedougou Region. This study examines the spatial and temporal variation of the genetic diversity and complexity of P. falciparum infections in acute febrile patients in Kedougou, southeastern Senegal. A total of 263 sera from patients presenting with acute febrile illness and attending Kedougou health facilities between July 2009 and July 2013 were obtained from a collection established as part of arbovirus surveillance in Kedougou. Samples identified as P. falciparum by nested PCR were characterized for their genetic diversity and complexity using msp-1 and msp-2 polymorphic markers.
   Results: Samples containing only P. falciparum accounted for 60.83% (160/263) of the examined samples. All three msp-1 allelic families (K1, MAD20 and RO33) and two msp-2 allelic families (FC27 and 3D7) were detected in all villages investigated over the 5-year collection period. The average genotype per allelic family was comparable between villages. Frequencies of msp-1 and msp-2 allelic types showed no correlation with age (Fisher's exact test, P =0.59) or gender (Fisher's exact test, P=0.973), and were similarly distributed throughout the 5-year sampling period (Fisher's exact test, P=0.412) and across villages (Fisher's exact test, P=0.866). Mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) for both msp-1 and msp-2 was highest in Kedougou village (2.25 and 2.21, respectively) and among younger patients aged <= 15 years (2.12 and 2.00, respectively). The mean MOI was highest in 2009 and decreased progressively onward.
   Conclusion: Characterization of the genetic diversity and complexity of P. falciparum infections in Kedougou revealed no spatio-temporal variation in the genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates. However, mean MOI varied with time of sera collection and decreased over the course of the study (July 2009 to July 2013). This suggests a slow progressive decrease of malaria transmission intensity in Kedougou Region despite the limited impact of preventive and control measures implemented by the National Malaria Control Programme on malaria morbidity and mortality.

TI Recent uptake of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with
   sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is associated with increased prevalence of
   Pfdhfr mutations in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The impact of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) used as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) on mutant parasite selection has been poorly documented in Burkina Faso. This study sought first to explore the relationship between IPTp-SP and the presence of mutant parasites. Second, to assess the relationship between the mutant parasites and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods: From September to December 2010, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected during antenatal care visits and at delivery from 109 pregnant women with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria infection. DBS were analysed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the polymorphisms at codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 of the Pfdhfr gene and codons 437 and 540 in the Pfdhps gene.
   Results: Both the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were successfully genotyped in 92.7% (101/109) of the samples. The prevalence of Pfdhfr mutations N51I, C59R and S108N was 71.3, 42.6 and 64.4%, respectively. Overall, 80.2% (81/101) of samples carried the Pfdhps A437G mutation. None of the samples had the Pfdhfr I164L and the Pfdhps K540E mutations. The prevalence of the triple mutation N51I + C59R + S108N was 25.7% (26/101). The use of IPTp-SP was associated with a threefold increased odds of Pfdhfr C59R mutation [crude OR 3.29; 95% CI (1.44-7.50)]. Pregnant women with recent uptake of IPTp-SP were at higher odds of both the Pfdhfr C59R mutation [adjusted OR 4.26; 95% CI (1.64-11.07)] and the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance, i.e., >= 2 Pfdhfr mutations [adjusted OR 3.45; 95% CI (1.18-10.07)]. There was no statistically significant association between the presence of the Pfdhfr intermediate-tohigh resistance and parasite densities or both maternal haemoglobin level and anaemia.
   Conclusion: The data indicate that despite the possibility that IPTp-SP contributes to the selection of resistant parasites, it did not potentiate pregnancy-associated malaria morbidity, suggesting the continuation of SP use as IPTp in Burkina Faso.

TI Beyond the entomological inoculation rate: characterizing multiple blood
   feeding behavior and Plasmodium falciparum multiplicity of infection in
   Anopheles mosquitoes in northern Zambia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: A commonly used measure of malaria transmission intensity is the entomological inoculation rate (EIR), defined as the product of the human biting rate (HBR) and sporozoite infection rate (SIR). The EIR excludes molecular parameters that may influence vector control and surveillance strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate Anopheles multiple blood feeding behavior (MBF) and Plasmodium falciparum multiplicity of infection (MOI) within the mosquito host in Nchelenge District, northern Zambia. Mosquitoes were collected from light traps and pyrethroid spray catch in Nchelenge in the 2013 wet season. All anophelines were tested for blood meal host, P. falciparum, and MOI using PCR. Circumsporozoite (CSP) ELISA and microsatellite analysis were performed to detect parasites in the mosquito and MBF, respectively. Statistical analyses used regression models to assess MBF and MOI and exact binomial test for human sex bias. Both MBF and MOI can enhance our understanding of malaria transmission dynamics beyond what is currently understood through conventional EIR estimates alone.
   Results: The dominant malaria vectors collected in Nchelenge were Anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) and An. gambiae (s.s.) The EIRs of An. funestus (s.s.) and An. gambiae (s.s.) were 39.6 infectious bites/person/6 months (ib/p/6mo) and 5.9 ib/p/6mo, respectively, and took multiple human blood meals at high rates, 23.2 and 25.7% respectively. There was no bias in human host sex preference in the blood meals. The SIR was further characterized for parasite genetic diversity. The overall P. falciparum MOI was 6.4 in infected vectors, exceeding previously reported average MOIs in humans in Africa.
   Conclusions: Both Anopheles MBF rates and P. falciparum MOI in Nchelenge were among some of the highest reported in sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggest an underestimation of the EIR and large numbers of circulating parasite clones. Together, the results describe important molecular aspects of transmission excluded from the traditional EIR measurement. These elements may provide more sensitive measures with which to assess changes in transmission intensity and risk in vector and parasite surveillance programs.

TI Effect of a short course of iron polymaltose on acquisition of malarial
   parasitaemia in anaemic Indonesian schoolchildren: a randomized trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Concern exists about the safety of iron supplementation given to individuals in malarious areas. The possible unfavourable impact of iron supplementation on malaria might be less when slow-release iron compounds are used instead of ferrous salts, because no toxic non-transferrin bound iron is formed. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of iron supplementation using the slow-release iron compound iron polymaltose (IPM) on the acquisition of malarial parasitaemia.
   Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed in schoolchildren aged 5-18 years with mild or moderate anaemia on the Indonesian island Flores. Microscopic malaria-negative children were randomized to receive 8 weeks of IPM (6 mg elemental iron/kg/day) or placebo. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of microscopically detectable malarial parasitaemia at week 4, 8, 12 and 16 after start of treatment and the proportion of participants with real-time (RT) PCR positive malarial parasitaemia at week 16.
   Results: 294 Children were assigned to the IPM group and 297 to the placebo group. Whereas IPM supplementation failed to increased haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations, the IPM group had a significantly higher rate of occurrence of microscopically detectable parasitaemia [hazard ratio 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.2-4.0; P = 0.01]. This higher rate was confined to iron-replete children. At the end of the study, 89% of the children in the IPM group had remained free from microscopically detectable parasitaemia vs 95% of children in the placebo group. The proportion of plasmodial RT-PCR positive children was similar in both groups at week 16 (IPM group 16.6% vs placebo group 14.3%; P = 0.47). When analysis was restricted to iron-replete children (serum ferritin >= 30 mu g/l), there was a trend for a higher proportion being RT-PCR positive at week 16 in the IPM group compared with the placebo group (20 vs 13.3%; P = 0.07). Erythrocyte microcytosis was an independent risk factor for microscopically detectable malarial parasitaemia.
   Conclusions: A short course of IPM should be used cautiously in anaemic children in malaria endemic areas, as it has limited efficacy in treating iron deficiency, while it increases the rate of microscopic malarial parasitaemia in those with replete iron stores.

TI Submicroscopic Plasmodium prevalence in relation to malaria incidence in
   20 villages in western Cambodia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Cambodia has seen a marked reduction in the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum over the past decade without a corresponding decline in Plasmodium vivax incidence. It is unknown to what extent local transmission is sustained by a chain of clinical and sub-clinical infections or by continued re-introduction via migration. Using an ultrasensitive molecular technique, 20 villages in western Cambodia were surveyed to detect the low season prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax and local treatment records were reviewed.
   Methods: During March to May 2015 cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 20 villages in Battambang, western Cambodia. Demographic and epidemiological data and venous blood samples were collected from 50 randomly selected adult volunteers in each village. Blood was tested for Plasmodium infections by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy and high volume (0.5 ml packed red blood cell) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (uPCR). Positive samples were analysed by nested PCR to determine the Plasmodium species. Malaria case records were collected from the Provincial Health Department and village malaria workers to determine incidence and migration status.
   Results: Among the 1000 participants, 91 (9.1%) were positive for any Plasmodium infection by uPCR, seven (0.7%) by microscopy, and two (0.2%) by RDT. uPCR P. vivax prevalence was 6.6%, P. falciparum 0.7%, and undetermined Plasmodium species 1.8%. Being male (adjusted OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.4); being a young adult < 30 years (aOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.33.4); recent forest travel (aOR 2.8; 95% CI 1.6-4.8); and, a history of malaria (aOR 5.2; 95% CI 2.5-10.7) were independent risk factors for parasitaemia. Of the clinical malaria cases diagnosed by village malaria workers, 43.9% (297/634) and 38.4% (201/523) were among migrants in 2013 and in 2014, respectively. Plasmodium vivax prevalence determined by uPCR significantly correlated with vivax malaria incidences in both 2014 and 2015 (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively), whereas no relationship was observed in falciparum malaria (p = 0.36 and p = 0.59, respectively).
   Discussion: There was heterogeneity in the malaria parasite reservoir between villages, and Plasmodium prevalence correlated with subsequent malaria incidence. The association was attributable chiefly to P. vivax infections, which were nine-fold more prevalent than P. falciparum infections. In the absence of a radical cure with 8-aminoquinolines, P. vivax transmission will continue even as P. falciparum prevalence declines. Migration was associated with over a third of incident cases of clinical malaria.

   falciparum by SNP-LAMP assay combined with lateral flow dipstick
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The significant strides made in reducing global malaria burden over the past decades are being threatened by the emergence of multi-drug resistant malaria. Mechanisms of resistance to several classes of antimalarial drugs have been linked to key mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum genes. Pyrimethamine targets the dihydrofolate reductase of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and specific point mutations in the dhfr-ts gene have been assigned to resistant phenotypes. Several molecular methods are available to detect the mutant genotypes including DNA sequencing and PCR-based methods. In this study, we report the development of PfSNP-LAMP to detect nucleotide polymorphism in the dhfr gene associated with N511 mutation and antifolate resistance. The P./SNP-LAMP method was validated with genomic DNA samples and parasite lysates prepared from sensitive and pyrimethamine resistant strains of P. falciparum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Estimation of the In Vivo MIC of Cipargamin in Uncomplicated Plasmodium
   falciparum Malaria
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB The MIC of an antimalarial drug for a particular infection is the drug level associated with a net parasite multiplication rate of one per asexual cycle. To ensure the cure of malaria, the MIC must be exceeded until all parasites have been eliminated. The development of highly sensitive and accurate PCR quantitation of low-density malaria parasitemia enables the prospective pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characterization of antimalarial drug effects and now allows identification of the in vivo MIC. An adaptive design and a PK-PD modeling approach were used to determine prospectively the MIC of the new antimalarial cipargamin (KAE609) in adults with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in an open-label, dose-ranging phase 2a study. Vietnamese adults with acute P. falciparum malaria were allocated sequentially to treatment with a single 30-mg (n = 6), 20-mg (n = 5), 10-mg (n = 7), or 15-mg (n = 7) dose of cipargamin. Artemisinin-based combination therapy was given after parasite densities had fallen and then risen as cipargamin levels declined below the MIC but before a return of signs or symptoms. The rates of parasite clearance were dose dependent, with near saturation of the effect being seen at an adult dose of 30 mg. The developed PK-PD model accurately predicted the therapeutic responses in 23/25 patients. The predicted median in vivo MIC was 0.126 ng/ml (range, 0.038 to 0.803 ng/ml). Pharmacometric characterization of the relationship between antimalarial drug concentrations and parasite clearance rates following graded subtherapeutic antimalarial drug dosing is safe and provides a rational framework for dose finding in antimalarial drug development.

TI Assessment of co-segregated TLR4 genotypes among Nigerian children with
   asymptomatic and clinical malaria
SO ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Objective: To assess the occurrence and pattern of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cosegregated genotypes among children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Nigeria.
   Methods: In this case-control study, a total of 79 Plasmodium falciparum infected children aged 2-7 years and 105 age-matched uninfected controls of Yoruba descents in Lagos were studied. The extracted DNA samples were used for TLR4 genotyping at codons 299 (Asp > Gly) and 399 (Thr>Ile) by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Malaria infection was diagnosed by blood smear microscopy and infected children were stratified into asymptomatic, uncomplicated and severe malaria sub-groups. Malnutrition was determined by measuring the mid upper arm circumference and anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 11 g/dL.
   Results: The proportions of children with acute malnutrition and severe anemia were 12.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Parasitemia and malnutrition were not correlated and four distinct patterns of TLR4 genotypes were found in the study population: Asp299Asp/Thr399Thr (90.2%), Asp299Gly/Thr399Thr (4.3%), Gly299Gly/ Thr399Thr (3.8%) and Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile (1.6%). These genotypes did not differ significantly (P> 0.05) in frequency between infected and non-infected children. However, low and high occurrences of the TLR4 Asp299Asp/Thr399Thr and Asp299Gly/Thr399Thr genotypes were observed in the severe malaria subgroup.
   Conclusions: This study reveals a protective role for TLR4 Asp299Gly/ Thr399Ile and Asp299Asp/Thr399Thr genotypes against severe malaria in Nigerian children.

TI A surrogate marker of piperaquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria: a phenotype-genotype association study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background Western Cambodia is the epicentre of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance and is facing high rates of dihydroartemisinin piperaquine treatment failures. Genetic tools to detect the multidrug-resistant parasites are needed. Artemisinin resistance can be tracked using the 1(13 molecular marker, but no marker exists for piperaquine resistance. We aimed to identify genetic markers of piperaquine resistance and study their association with dihydroartemisinin piperaquine treatment failures.
   Methods We obtained blood samples from Cambodian patients infected with P falciparum and treated with dihydroartemisinin piperaquine. Patients were followed up for 42 days during the years 2009-15. We established in vitro and ex-vivo susceptibility profiles for a subset using piperaquine survival assays. We determined whole-genome sequences by Illumina paired-reads sequencing, copy number variations by qPCR, RNA concentrations by qRT-PCR, and protein concentrations by immunoblotting. Fisher's exact and non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to identify significant differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, respectively, for differential distribution between piperaquine-resistant and piperaquine-sensitive parasite lines.
   Findings Whole-genome exon sequence analysis of 31 culture-adapted parasite lines associated amplification of the plasmepsin 2 plasmepsin 3 gene cluster with in-vitro piperaquine resistance. Ex-vivo piperaquine survival assay profiles of 134 isolates correlated with plasmepsin 2 gene copy number. In 725 patients treated with dihydroartemisinin piperaquine, multicopy plasmepsin 2 in the sample collected before treatment was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for treatment failure of 20.4 (95% CI 9.1-45.5, p<0.0001). Multicopy plasmepsin 2 predicted dihydroartemisinin piperaquine failures with 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.98) sensitivity and 0.77 (0.74-0.81) specificity. Analysis of samples collected across the country from 2002 to 2015 showed that the geographical and temporal increase of the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites was highly correlated with increasing dihydroartemisinin piperaquine treatment failure rates (r=0.89 [95% CI 0.77-0.95], p<0.0001, Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation). Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine efficacy at day 42 fell below 90% when the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites exceeded 22%.
   Interpretation Piperaquine resistance in Cambodia is strongly associated with amplification of plasmepsin 2-3, encoding haemoglobin-digesting proteases, regardless of the location. Multicopy plasmepsin 2 constitutes a surrogate molecular marker to track piperaquine resistance. A molecular toolkit combining plasmepsin 2 with K13 and mdrl monitoring should provide timely information for antimalarial treatment and containment policies.

TI Reduced ex vivo susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum after oral
   artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Mali
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide. However, recent studies conducted in Mali showed an increased frequency of recurrent parasitaemia following artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment.
   Methods: Study samples were collected during a large WANECAM study. Ex-vivo Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to artemether and lumefantrine was assessed using the tritiated hypoxanthine-based assay. The prevalence of molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance (pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y and K13-propeller) were measured by PCR and/or sequencing.
   Results: Overall 61 samples were successfully analysed in ex vivo studies. Mean IC(50)s increased significantly between baseline and recurrent parasites for both artemether (1.6 nM vs 3.2 nM, p < 0.001) and lumefantrine (1.4 nM vs 3.4 nM, p = 0.004). Wild type Pfmdr1 N86 allele was selected after treatment (71 vs 91%, 112 of 158 vs 95 of 105, p < 0.001) but not the wild type pfcrt K76 variant (23.5 vs 24.8%, 40 of 170 vs 26 of 105, p = 0.9). Three non-synonymous K13-propeller SNPs (A522C, A578S, and G638R) were found with allele frequencies < 2%.
   Conclusion: Malian post-AL P. falciparum isolates were less susceptible to artemether and lumefantrine than baseline isolates.

TI High Plasmodium falciparum longitudinal prevalence is associated with
   high multiclonality and reduced clinical malaria risk in a seasonal
   transmission area of Mali
SO PLOS ONE
AB The effects of persistent Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection and multiclonality on subsequent risk of clinical malaria have been reported, but the relationship between these 2 parameters and their relative impacts on the clinical outcome of infection are not understood. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a seasonal and high-transmission area of Mali, in which 500 subjects aged 1-65 years were followed for 1 year. Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks, and incident malaria cases were diagnosed and treated. Pf infection in each individual at each time point was assessed by species-specific nestedPCR, and Pf longitudinal prevalence per person (PfLP, proportion of Pf-positive samples over 1 year) was calculated. Multiclonality of Pf infection was measured using a 24-SNP DNA barcoding assay at 4 time-points (two in wet season, and two in dry season) over one year. PfLP was positively correlated with multiclonality at each time point (all r >= 0.36; all P <= 0.011). When host factors (e. g., age, gender), PfLP, and multiclonality (at the beginning of the transmission season) were analyzed together, only increasing age and high PfLP were associated with reduced clinical malaria occurrence or reduced number of malaria episodes (for both outcomes, P<0.001 for age, and P = 0.005 for PfLP). When age, PfLP and baseline Pf positivity were analyzed together, the effect of high PfLP remained significant even after adjusting for the other two factors (P = 0.001 for malaria occurrence and P<0.001 for number of episodes). In addition to host age and baseline Pf positivity, both of which have been reported as important modifiers of clinical malaria risk, our results demonstrate that persistent parasite carriage, but not baseline multiclonality, is associated with reduced risk of clinical disease in this population. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering repeated parasite exposure in future studies that evaluate clinical malaria risk.

TI Hidden reservoir of resistant parasites: the missing link in the
   elimination of falciparum malaria
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background: To successfully eliminate malaria, an integrated system that includes a number of approaches and interventions-aimed at overcoming the threat of antimalarial drug resistance-is required. Significant progress has been made in reducing malaria incidence through large-scale use of artemisinin-based combination therapies and insecticide-treated nets. To consolidate these gains, attention should be paid to the missing links in the elimination of malaria. One of these gaps is the residual reservoir of submicroscopic resistant parasites, which remains after case management or other control measures have been carried out. Therefore, the present opinion piece highlights the importance of exploring the role that submicroscopic resistant parasites could play in hindering malaria elimination by allowing the persistence of transmission, particularly in areas of low transmission or in the pre-elimination and/or elimination phase.
   Discussion: If malaria elimination interventions are to be effective, the relative role of the hidden reservoir of resistant parasites needs to be assessed, particularly in regions that are low-transmission settings and/or in pre-elimination and/or elimination phases. Various ongoing studies are focusing on the role of submicroscopic malaria infections in malaria transmission but overlook the possible build-up of resistance to antimalarial drugs among submicroscopic parasite populations. This is an important factor as it may eventually limit the effectiveness of malaria elimination strategies.
   Conclusions: An evidence-based estimation of the "true" reservoir of resistant parasites can help target the existing and emerging foci of resistant parasites before they spread. Emergence and spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia underline the need to contain drug resistance.

TI Therapeutic efficacy and effects of artemisinin-based combination
   treatments on uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria -associated
   anaemia in Nigerian children during seven years of adoption as
   first-line treatments
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background: Artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) are the first-line treatments of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many endemic areas but there are few evaluation of their efficacy in anaemic malarious children.
   Methods: Therapeutic efficacy of 3-day regimens of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine was evaluated in 437 anaemic and 909 non-anaemic malarious children following treatment during a seven-year period (2008-2014). Patterns of temporal changes in haematocrit were classified based on haematocrit values < 30% and >= 30%. Kinetics of the disposition of the deficit in haematocrit from 30% following treatment were evaluated using a non-compartment model.
   Results: PCR-corrected parasitological efficacy 28 days after start of treatment was significantly higher in artesunate-amodiaquine-compared to artemether-lumefantrine-treated children [97% (95% CI: 92.8-100) versus 96.4% (95% CI: 91.3-99.4), P = 0.02], but it was similar in non-anaemic and anaemic children. Fall in haematocrit/1 000 asexual parasites cleared from peripheral blood was significantly greater at lower compared to higher parasitaemias (P < 0.0001), and in non-anaemic compared to anaemic children (P = 0.007). In anaemic children at presentation, mean anaemia recovery time (AnRT) was 15.4 days (95% CI: 13.3-17.4) and it did not change over the years. Declines in haematocrit deficits from 30% were monoexponential with mean estimated half-time of 1.4 days (95% CI: 1.2-1.6). Anaemia half-time (t(1/2anaemia)) correlated positively with AnRT in the same patients (r = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis of 10 multiples of t(1/2anaemia) and AnRT showed narrow limit of agreement with insignificant bias (P = 0.07) suggesting both can be used interchangeably in the same patients.
   Conclusions: Artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine remain efficacious treatments of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in non-anaemic and anaemic Nigerian children in the last 7 years of adoption as first-line treatments. These ACTs may also conserve haematocrit at high parasitaemias and in anaemic children.

TI Cellulose filtration of blood from malaria patients for improving ex
   vivo growth of Plasmodium falciparum parasites
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Establishing in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture lines from patient parasite isolates can offer deeper understanding of geographic variations of drug sensitivity and mechanisms of malaria pathogenesis and immunity. Cellulose column filtration of blood is an inexpensive, rapid and effective method for the removal of host factors, such as leucocytes and platelets, significantly improving the purification of parasite DNA in a blood sample.
   Methods: In this study, the effect of cellulose column filtration of venous blood on the initial in vitro growth of P. falciparum parasite isolates from Tanzanian children admitted to hospital was tested. The parasites were allowed to expand in culture without subcultivation until 5 days after admission or the appearance of dead parasites and parasitaemia was determined daily. To investigate whether the filtration had an effect on clonality, P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 genotyping was performed using nested PCR on extracted genomic DNA, and the var gene transcript levels were investigated, using quantitative PCR on extracted RNA, at admission and 4 days of culture.
   Results: The cellulose-filtered parasites grew to higher parasitaemia faster than non-filtered parasites seemingly due to a higher development ratio of ring stage parasites progressing into the late stages. Cellulose filtration had no apparent effect on clonality or var gene expression; however, evident differences were observed after only 4 days of culture in both the number of clones and transcript levels of var genes compared to the time of admission.
   Conclusions: Cellulose column filtration of parasitized blood is a cheap, applicable method for improving cultivation of P. falciparum field isolates for ex vivo based assays; however, when assessing phenotype and genotype of cultured parasites, in general, assumed to represent the in vivo infection, caution is advised.

TI Molecular evidence of Plasmodium vivax infection in Duffy negative
   symptomatic individuals from Dschang, West Cameroon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax infection is known to be rare in West/Central Africa, the most accepted explanation being the lack of expression of erythroid Duffy antigen in the local human populations. Duffy negativity prevents the parasite to exploit the entry mechanism on the red blood cell surface. However, there are a growing number of reported vivax infections in Duffy-negative individuals. Data on P. vivax circulation in Cameroon are limited. The aim of the study was to evaluate the P. vivax presence, and its association with the Duffy genotype in West Cameroon.
   Results: Overall, 484 blood samples were collected consecutively from febrile outpatients attending the Dschang's Hospital (West Cameroon) during a 3-months period. Plasmodium vivax infection was detected by PCR in 5.6% (n = 27/484) of the cases, representing 38.6% (n = 27/70) of all Plasmodium infections detected. All P. vivax infected individuals showed a Duffy-negative genotype, and the frequency of Duffy-positive individuals in the whole tested population was 1.7%.
   Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the circulation of P. vivax in Cameroon, as well as that the lack of expression of Duffy-antigen does not confer full protection against vivax malaria acquisition.

TI Nested multiplex PCR for identification and detection of human
   Plasmodium species including Plasmodium knowlesi
SO ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Objective: To develop a new technique for diagnosis of Plasmodium, knowlesi and at the same time to be able to discriminate among the diverse species of Plasmodium causing human malaria. Methods: In this study the nested multiplex malaria PCR was redesigned, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, to identify the fifth human Plasmodium species, Plasmodium knowlesi, together with the other human Plasmodium (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae) by amplified fragment size using only two amplification processes and including an internal reaction control to avoid false negatives. Results: The technique was validated with 91 clinical samples obtained from patients with malaria compatible symptoms. The technique showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (96%) when it was compared to the reference method employed for malaria diagnosis in the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and a published real-time PCR malaria assay. Conclusions: The technique designed is an economical, sensitive and specific alternative to current diagnosis methods. Furthermore, the method might be tested in knowlesi-malaria endemic areas with a higher number of samples to confirm the quality of the method.

TI Two-Stage Isothermal Enzymatic Amplification for Concurrent Multiplex
   Molecular Detection
SO CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
AB BACKGROUND: The wide array of pathogens responsible for infectious diseases makes it difficult to identify causative pathogens with single-plex tests. Although multiplex PCR detects multiple targets, it is restricted to centralized laboratories, which delays test results or makes multiplexing unavailable, depriving healthcare providers of critical, real-time information.
   METHODS: To address the need for point-of-care (POC) highly multiplexed tests, we propose the 2-stage, nested like, rapid (<40 min) isothermal amplification assay, dubbed rapid amplification (RAMP). RAMP's first-stage uses outer loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) primers to amplify all targets with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). First-stage amplicons are ali-quoted to second stage reactors, each specialized for a specific target, to undergo LAMP. The assay is implemented in a microfluidic chip. LAMP amplicons are detected in situ with colorimetric dye or with a fluorescent dye and a smartphone.
   RESULTS: In experiments on a benchtop and in a microfluidic format, RAMP demonstrated high level of multiplexing (>= 16); high sensitivity (i.e., 1 plaque-forming unit of Zika virus) and specificity (no false positives or negatives); speed (<40 min); ease of use; and ability to cope with minimally processed samples.
   CONCLUSIONS: RAMP is a hybrid, 2-stage, rapid, and highly sensitive and specific assay with extensive multiplexing capabilities, combining the advantages of RPA and LAMP, while circumventing their respective shortcomings. RAMP can be used in the lab, but one of its distinct advantages is amenability to simple implementation in a microfluidic format for use at the POC, providing healthcare personnel with an inexpensive, highly sensitive tool to detect multiple pathogens in a single sample, on site.

TI Treatment of Chronic Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Infection Does
   Not Increase the Risk of Clinical Malaria Upon Reinfection
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Chronic asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic areas and are thought to contribute to the maintenance of malaria immunity. Whether treatment of these infections increases the subsequent risk of clinical episodes of malaria is unclear.
   Methods. In a 3-year study in Mali, asymptomatic individuals with or without P. falciparum infection at the end of the 6-month dry season were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical malaria risk was compared during the ensuing 6-month malaria transmission season. At the end of the second dry season, 3 groups of asymptomatic children were identified: (1) children infected with P. falciparum as detected by rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) who were treated with antimalarials (n = 104), (2) RDT-negative children whose untreated P. falciparum infections were detected retrospectively by PCR (n = 55), and (3) uninfected children (RDT/PCR negative) (n = 434). Clinical malaria risk during 2 subsequent malaria seasons was compared. Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibody kinetics during the dry season were compared in children who did or did not harbor asymptomatic P. falciparum infections.
   Results. Chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infection predicted decreased clinical malaria risk during the subsequent malaria season(s); treatment of these infections did not alter this reduced risk. Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibodies declined similarly in children who did or did not harbor chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infection during the dry season.
   Conclusions. These findings challenge the notion that chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infection maintains malaria immunity and suggest that mass drug administration during the dry season should not increase the subsequent risk of clinical malaria.

TI Preferential expression of domain cassettes 4, 8 and 13 of Plasmodium
   falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 in severe malaria imported in
   France
SO CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB Objectives: Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria (SM) involves cytoadhesion of parasitized red blood cells, mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1, which is encoded by var genes. Expression of var gene group A and B or encoding domain cassettes DC4, DC5, DC8 and DC13 has been implicated in SM in African children, but no data exist in the context of imported malaria. The aim of this study was to investigate var gene expression linked to clinical presentation and host factors in SM imported into France.
   Methods: Expression level of var gene groups A, B, C, var1, var2csa, var3 and var genes encoding DC4, DC5, DC8 and DC13 was measured by quantitative RT- PCR and expressed in transcript units. Seventy SM and 48 uncomplicated malaria (UM) P. falciparum cases were analysed according to disease severity, epidemiological characteristics (migrants or travellers) and anti- P. falciparum antibodies. Cluster analysis was performed to identify gene expression profiles.
   Results: Var1 and B/ C expression were higher in UM than SM (0.66 (0-1.1) and 1.88 (1.3-2.4); p < 0.04, respectively). Group C expression differed between migrants and travellers (0.21 (0-0.75) versus 0 (0e0); p 0.002). Group A differed in naive and pre- exposed patients (1.1 (0.7-1.5) versus 0.4 (0-1.1); p 0.01). Population clusters revealed increased expression from group A and B var genes, and DC4, DC8 and DC13 in SM.
   Conclusions: These results corroborate the implication of DC4, DC8 and DC13 in severe imported malaria cases as African children, and their expression depends of host factors.

TI Improved detection of mixed P-falciparum-P-vivax infection at a rural
   health centre in Ethiopia using PCR
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB This study aims to this study is to compare the co-infection Plasmodium falciparum + Plasmodium vivax and compare the detection of cases of mixed-species malaria using light microscopy versus semi-nested multiplex PCR (sPCR). Investigators collected 3060 samples at a rural health centre in Ethiopia from December 2010 to October 2011. Two capillary blood specimens were taken from each patient, one for diagnosis of Plasmodium infection by light microscopy and the other for sPCR-based diagnosis. LM detected 627 positive cases; these samples, together with 582 negatives by LM, were also subjected to sPCR testing. Of the 627 positive samples by LM, 68.4% were positive for P. vivax, 30.5% for P. falciparum, and 1.1% for P. falciparum + P. vivax co-infection. Using the sPCR technique, we identified 788 samples positive for Plasmodium: 33.0% for P. vivax, 26.5% for P. falciparum, 3.7% for P. falciparum + P. vivax co-infection, 2.0% for P. ovale and 0.8% for P. vivax + P. ovale co-infection. In the case of P. falciparum + P. vivax co-infection, light microscopy diagnosis showed a sensitivity of 11.1%, a specificity of 99.8%, a positive predictive value of 71.4% and a negative predictive value of 96.6%. The concordance rate for identifying P. falciparum + P. vivax co-infection (kappa statistic) with microscopy and sPCR was 0.184. The LM approach has low sensitivity for the detection of mixed-species infections, while sPCR is more useful.

TI Enhanced Sensitivity for Detection of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes
   by magnetic nanoparticles combined with enzyme substrate system
SO TALANTA
AB The highly sensitive and specific detection of Pfg377 gene of Plasmodium fakiparum gametocyte using Magnetic Nanoparticles PCR Enzyme-Linked Gene Assay (MELGA) was successfully developed. The MELGA included amplification of the Pfg377 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-conjugated forward primer and biotinylated reverse primer, followed by post-analytical process using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (SA). The complexes of MELGA product were incubated with the peroxidase substrate and hydrogen peroxide to produce the signal for colorimetric measurement. Altogether, the MELGA technique provided a highly sensitive and specific detection at 1 P. fakiparum gametocyte/mu L, which was more efficient than that of microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Additionally, the MELGA could detect target gene at femtogram level, which was greater sensitive than the conventional PCR, nested PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The MELGA technique could become a novel and practical method that overcome limitation of traditional gametocyte detection.

TI Molecular Epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum kelch13 Mutations in
   Senegal Determined by Using Targeted Amplicon Deep Sequencing
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin in Southeast Asia threatens malaria control and elimination activities worldwide. Multiple polymorphisms in the P. falciparum kelch gene found in chromosome 13 (Pfk13) have been associated with artemisinin resistance. Surveillance of potential drug resistance loci within a population that may emerge under increasing drug pressure is an important public health activity. In this context, P. falciparum infections from an observational surveillance study in Senegal were genotyped using targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) for Pfk13 polymorphisms. The results were compared to previously reported Pfk13 polymorphisms from around the world. A total of 22 Pfk13 propeller domain polymorphisms were identified in this study, of which 12 have previously not been reported. Interestingly, of the 10 polymorphisms identified in the present study that were also previously reported, all had a different amino acid substitution at these codon positions. Most of the polymorphisms were present at low frequencies and were confined to single isolates, suggesting they are likely transient polymorphisms that are part of naturally evolving parasite populations. The results of this study underscore the need to identify potential drug resistance loci existing within a population, which may emerge under increasing drug pressure.

TI Ultrastructural Comparison of Hepatozoon ixoxo and Hepatozoon theileri
   (Adeleorina: Hepatozoidae), Parasitising South African Anurans
SO JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB To date, only two haemogregarine parasite species have been described from South African anurans: Hepatozoon ixoxo, infecting toads of the genus Sclerophrys (syn. Amietophrynus); and Hepatozoon theileri, parasitising the common river frog, Amietia quecketti. Both species have been characterised using limited morphology, and molecular data from PCR amplified fragments of the 18S rRNA gene. However, no ultrastructural work has been performed thus far. The aim of this study was to add descriptive information on the two species by studying their ultrastructural morphology. Mature gamont stages, common in the peripheral blood of infected frogs, were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results indicate that H.ixoxo and H.theileri share typical apicomplexan characteristics, but differ markedly in their external cellular structure. Hepatozoon ixoxo is an encapsulated parasite presenting a prominent cap at the truncate pole, and shows no visible modifications to the host cell membrane. In comparison, H.theileri does not present a capsule or cap, and produces marked morphological changes to its host cell. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to further examine the cytopathological effects of H.theileri, and results revealed small, knob-like protrusions on the erythrocyte surface, as well as notable distortion of the overall shape of the host cell.

TI Clinical, virological, and biological parameters associated with
   outcomes of Ebola virus infection in Macenta, Guinea
SO JCI INSIGHT
AB BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is poorly characterized. The establishment of well-equipped diagnostic laboratories close to Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) has made it possible to obtain relevant virological and biological data during the course of EVD and to assess their association with the clinical course and different outcomes of the disease.
   METHODS. We were responsible for diagnosing EBOV infection in patients admitted to two ETCs in forested areas of Guinea. The pattern of clinical signs was recorded, and an etiological diagnosis was established by RT-PCR for EBOV infection or a rapid test for malaria and typhoid fever. Biochemical analyses were also performed.
   RESULTS. We handled samples from 168 patients between November 29, 2014, and January 31, 2015; 97 patients were found to be infected with EBOV, with Plasmodium falciparum coinfection in 18%. Overall mortality for EVD cases was 58%, rising to 86% if P. falciparum was also present. Viral load was higher in fatal cases of EVD than in survivors, and fatal cases were associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 levels. Furthermore, regardless of outcome, EVD was characterized by higher creatine kinase (CPK), amylase, and creatinine levels than in febrile patients without EVD, with higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in fatal cases of EVD only.
   CONCLUSION. These findings suggest that a high viral load at admission is a marker of poor EVD prognosis. In addition, high AST, ALT, CRP, and IL-6 levels are associated with a fatal outcome of EVD. Damage to the liver and other tissues, with massive rhabdomyolysis and, probably, acute pancreatitis, is associated with EVD and correlated with disease severity. Finally, biochemical analyses provide substantial added value at ETCs, making it possible to improve supportive rehydration and symptomatic care for patients.

TI Evaluation of the Parasight Platform for Malaria Diagnosis
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500 million malaria tests are performed annually. While microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the main diagnostic approaches, no single method is inexpensive, rapid, and highly accurate. Two recent studies from our group have demonstrated a prototype computer vision platform that meets those needs. Here we present the results from two clinical studies on the commercially available version of this technology, the Sight Diagnostics Parasight platform, which provides malaria diagnosis, species identification, and parasite quantification. We conducted a multisite trial in Chennai, India (Apollo Hospital [n = 205]), and Nairobi, Kenya (Aga Khan University Hospital [n = 263]), in which we compared the device to microscopy, RDTs, and PCR. For identification of malaria, the device performed similarly well in both contexts (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 100% at the Indian site and sensitivity of 99.3% and specificity of 98.9% at the Kenyan site, compared to PCR). For species identification, the device correctly identified 100% of samples with Plasmodium vivax and 100% of samples with Plasmodium falciparum in India and 100% of samples with P. vivax and 96.1% of samples with P. falciparum in Kenya, compared to PCR. Lastly, comparisons of the device parasite counts with those of trained microscopists produced average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84 at the Indian site and 0.85 at the Kenyan site.

TI Molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance falciparum malaria
   among migrant goldmine workers in Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin resistance has been reported in Greater Mekong Sub-region countries, including Myanmar. After discovery of artemisinin resistance marker (K13), molecular surveillance on artemisinin resistance in endemic regions have been conducted. As the migrant population represents a high percentage of malaria cases, molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance among migrant workers is of great concern.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shwegyin Township, where migrants work in the goldmines. Blood samples were collected from uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum-infected migrant workers by active and passive cases screening with rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and microscopy. Amplification and sequence analysis of artemisinin resistance molecular markers, such as k13, pfarps10, pffd, pfmdr2, pfmrp1, pfrad5, and pfcnbp, were carried out and pfmdr1 copy number analysis was conducted by real-time PCR.
   Results: Among the 100 falciparum-infected patients, most were male (90%), of working age (20-40 years) with median parasite density of 11,166 parasites/mu L (range 270-110,472 parasites/mu L). Artemisinin resistance molecular marker, k13 mutations were detected in (21/100, 21.0%) in which composed of a validated marker, C580Y (9/21, 42.9%) and candidate markers such as P574L (5/21, 23.8%), P667T (5/21, 23.8%) and M476I (2/21, 9.5%). Underlying genetic markers predisposing to become k13 mutants were found as V127M of pfarps10 (41/100, 41.0%), D153Y of pffd (64/100, 64.0%), T484I of pfmdr2 (58/100, 58.0%) and F1390I of pfmrp1 (24/100, 24.0%). The pfmdr1 copy number analysis revealed six copy numbers (1/100, 1.0%), three (2/100, 2.0%), two (8/100, 8.0%) and only one copy number (89/100, 89.0%). Only one sample showed both k13 mutation (P667T) and multiple copy number of pfmdr1.
   Conclusions: High mutant rate of artemisinin resistance markers and relatively high pfmdr1 copy number among isolates collected from migrant goldmine workers alert the importance of containment measures among this target population. Clinical and molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance among migrants should be scaled up.

TI Development, standardization and validation of molecular techniques for
   malaria vector species identification, trophic preferences, and
   detection of Plasmodium falciparum
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES
AB Background & objectives: Knowledge on prevalence of malaria vector species of a certain area provides important information for implementation of appropriate control strategies. The present study describes a rapid method for screening of major Anopheline vector species and at the same time detection of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection and blood meal preferences/trophic preferences.
   Methods: The study was carried from February 2012 to March 2013 in three seasons, i.e. rainy, winter and summer in Jhumpura PHC of Keonjhar district, Odisha, India. Processing of mosquitoes was carried out in two different methods, viz. mosquito pool (P1) and mosquito DNA pool (P2). Pool size for both the methods was standardized for DNA isolation and multiplex PCR assay. This PCR based assay was employed to screen the major vector composition in three different seasons of four different ecotypes of Keonjhar district. Pearson's correlation coefficient was determined for a comparative analysis of the morphological identification with the pool prevalence assay for each ecotype.
   Results: A pool size of 10 was standardized for DNA isolation as well as PCR. PCR assay revealed that the average pool prevalence for all ecotypes was highest for An. annularis in winter and summer whereas for An. culicifacies it was rainy season. Foothill and plain ecotypes contributed to highest and lowest vectorial abundance respectively. The results of the prevalence of vector species in pool from PCR based assay were found to be highly correlated with that of the results of morphological identification.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Screening by pool based PCR assay is relatively rapid as compared to conventional morphological identification and can be employed as an important tool in malaria control programmes.

TI Evaluation of SYBR green I based visual loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification (LAMP) assay for genus and species-specific diagnosis of
   malaria in P. vivax and P. falciparum endemic regions
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES
AB Background & objectives: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an emerging nucleic acid based diagnostic approach that is easily adaptable to the field settings with limited technical resources. This study was aimed to evaluate the LAMP assay for the detection and identification of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infection in malaria suspected cases using genus and species-specific assay.
   Methods: The 18S rRNA-based LAMP assay was evaluated for diagnosis of genus Plasmodium, and speciesspecific diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax, infection employing 317 malaria suspected cases, and the results were compared with those obtained by 18S nested PCR (n-PCR). All the samples were confirmed by microscopy for the presence of Plasmodium parasite.
   Results: The n-PCR was positive in all Plasmodium-infected cases (n= 257; P. falciparum= 133; P. vivax= 124) and negative in microscopy negative cases (n= 58) except for two cases which were positive for P. vivax, giving a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 97.04-100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 88.45-99.5%). Genus-specific LAMP assay missed 11 (3.2%) microscopy and n-PCR confirmed vivax malaria cases. Considering PCR results as a reference, LAMP was 100% sensitive and specific for P. falciparum, whereas it exhibited 95.16% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity for P. vivax. The n-PCR assay detected 10 mixed infection cases while species-specific LAMP detected five mixed infection cases of P. vivax and P. falciparum, which were not detected by microscopy.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Genus-specific LAMP assay displayed low sensitivity. Falciparum specific LAMP assay displayed high sensitivity whereas vivax specific LAMP assay displayed low sensitivity. Failed detection of vivax cases otherwise confirmed by the n-PCR assay indicates exploitation of new targets and improved detection methods to attain 100% results for P. vivax detection.

TI The shape of the iceberg: quantification of submicroscopic Plasmodium
   falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia and gametocytaemia in five
   low endemic settings in Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The widespread presence of low-density asymptomatic infections with concurrent gametocytes may be a stumbling block for malaria elimination. This study investigated the asymptomatic reservoir of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections in schoolchildren from five settings in northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in June and November 2015, enrolling 551 students from five schools and 294 students from three schools, respectively. Finger prick whole blood and plasma samples were collected. The prevalence and density of P.falciparum and P.vivax parasitaemia and gametocytaemia were determined by 18S rRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pfs25 and pvs25 reverse transcriptase qPCR. Antibodies against blood stage antigens apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-119) were measured for both species.
   Results: Whilst only 6 infections were detected by microscopy in 881 slides (0.7%), 107 of 845 blood samples (12.7%) were parasite positive by (DNA-based) qPCR. qPCR parasite prevalence between sites and surveys ranged from 3.8 to 19.0% for P. falciparum and 0.0 to 9.0% for P. vivax. The median density of P. falciparum infections (n = 85) was 24.4 parasites/mu L (IQR 18.0-34.0) and the median density of P. vivax infections (n = 28) was 16.4 parasites/ mu L (IQR 8.8-55.1). Gametocyte densities by (mRNA-based) qRT-PCR were strongly associated with total parasite densities for both P. falciparum (correlation coefficient = 0.83, p = 0.010) and P. vivax (correlation coefficient = 0.58, p = 0.010). Antibody titers against P. falciparum AMA-1 and MSP-119 were higher in individuals who were P. falciparum parasite positive in both surveys (p < 0.001 for both comparisons).
   Discussion: This study adds to the available evidence on the wide-scale presence of submicroscopic parasitaemia by quantifying submicroscopic parasite densities and concurrent gametocyte densities. There was considerable heterogeneity in the occurrence of P. falciparum and P. vivax infections and serological markers of parasite exposure between the examined low endemic settings in Ethiopia.

TI Preliminary survey on Anopheles species distribution in Botswana shows
   the presence of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus complexes
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Botswana is one of the four front line malaria elimination countries in Southern Africa, with malaria control activities that include routine vector control. Past and recent studies have shown that Anopheles arabiensis is the only known vector of Plasmodium parasites in the country. This report presents a preliminary evaluation on Anopheles species composition in seven districts of Botswana with some inferences on their vectorial role.
   Results: Overall, 404 Anopheles mosquito females were collected, of which 196 were larvae collected from several breeding sites, and 208 were adults obtained from indoor pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). Anopheles arabiensis (58.9%) accounted for the highest relative frequency in 5 out of 7 districts sampled. The other species collected, among those identified, were barely represented: Anopheles longipalpis type C (16.3%), Anopheles parensis (8.9%), Anopheles quadri-annulatus (5.4%), and Anopheles leesoni (0.2%). PCR test for human beta-globin on mosquitoes collected by PSC showed that An. arabiensis and An. parensis had bitten human hosts. Moreover, An. arabiensis showed a non-negligible Plasmodium falciparum infection rate in two sites (3.0% and 2.5% in Chobe and Kweneng West districts, respectively).
   Conclusions: This work provides first time evidence of Anopheles diversity in several areas of Botswana. Anopheles arabiensis is confirmed to be widespread in all the sampled districts and to be vector of P. falciparum. Moreover, the presence of Anopheles funestus group in Botswana has been assessed. Further research, entomological surveillance activities and possibly vector control programmes need to be better developed and implemented as well as targeting outdoors resting vectors.

TI TOLLIP gene variant is associated with Plasmodium vivax malaria in the
   Brazilian Amazon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Toll-interacting protein is a negative regulator in the TLR signaling cascade, particularly by impeding the TLR2 and, TLR4 pathway. Recently, TOLLIP was shown to regulate human TLR signaling pathways. Two common TOLLIP polymorphisms (rs5743899 and rs3750920) were reported to be influencing IL-6, TNF and IL-10 expression. In this study, TOLLIP variants were investigated to their relation to Plasmodium vivax malaria in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods: This cohort study was performed in the municipalities of Careiro and, Manaus, in Western Brazilian Amazon. A total of 319 patients with P. vivax malaria and, 263 healthy controls with no previous history of malaria were included in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood collected on filter paper, using the QIAamp (R) DNA Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The rs5743899 and rs3750920 polymorphisms of the TOLLIP gene were typed by PCR-RFLP.
   Results: Homozygous individuals for the rs3750920 T allele gene had twice the risk of developing malaria when compared to individuals homozygous for the C allele (OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.23-3.07]; p = 0.004). In the dominant model, carriers the C allele indicates protection to malaria, carriers of the C allele were compared to individuals with the T allele, and the difference is highly significant (OR 0.52 [95% CI 0.37-0.76]; p = 0.0006). The linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms was weak (r2 = 0.037; D' = 0.27).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that genes involved in the TLRs-pathway may be involved in malaria susceptibility. The association of the TOLLIP rs3750920 T allele with susceptibility to malaria further provides evidence that genetic variations in immune response genes may predispose individuals to malaria.

TI Unexpected selections of Plasmodium falciparum polymorphisms in
   previously treatment-naive areas after monthly presumptive
   administration of three different anti-malarial drugs in Liberia 1976-78
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: To assess the effect on malaria prevalence, village specific monthly administrations of pyrimethamine, chlorproguanil, chloroquine or placebo were given to children in four previously treatment-naive Liberian villages, 1976-78. Plasmodium falciparum in vivo resistance developed to pyrimethamine only. Selection of molecular markers of P.falciparum resistance after 2 years of treatment are reported.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 191 study children in a survey in 1978. Polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmrp1 and pfnhe1 genes were determined using PCR-based methods.
   Results: Pfcrt 72-76 CVIET was found in one chloroquine village sample, all remaining samples had pfcrt CVMNK. Pfmdr1 N86 prevalence was 100%. A pfmdr1 T1069(ACT -> ACG) synonymous polymorphism was found in 30% of chloroquine village samples and 3% of other samples (P = 0.008). Variations in pfnhe1 block I were found in all except the chloroquine treated village (P < 0.001). Resistance associated pfdhfr 108N prevalence was 2% in the pyrimethamine village compared to 45-65% elsewhere, including the placebo village (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Chloroquine treatment possibly resulted in the development of pfcrt 72-76 CVIET. Selection of pfmdr1 T1069(ACG) and a pfnhe1 block 1 genotypes indicates that chloroquine treatment exerted a selective pressure on P. falciparum. Pyrimethamine resistance associated pfdhfr 108N was present prior to the introduction of any drug. Decreased pfdhfr 108N frequency concurrent with development of pyrimethamine resistance suggests a non-pfdhfr polymorphisms mediated resistance mechanism.

TI Comparison of the diagnostic performance of microscopic examination with
   nested polymerase chain reaction for optimum malaria diagnosis in Upper
   Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium infection is crucial for prompt malaria treatment and surveillance. Microscopic examination has been widely applied as the gold standard for malaria diagnosis in most part of malaria endemic areas, but its diagnostic value has been questioned, particularly in submicroscopic malaria. In this study, the diagnostic performance of microscopic examination and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated to establish optimal malaria diagnosis method in Myanmar.
   Methods: A total of 1125 blood samples collected from residents in the villages and towns located in Naung Cho, Pyin Oo Lwin, Tha Beik Kyin townships and Mandalay of Upper Myanmar were screened by microscopic examination and species-specific nested PCR method.
   Results: Among the 1125 blood samples, 261 samples were confirmed to be infected with malaria by microscopic examination. Evaluation of the 1125 samples by species-specific nested PCR analysis revealed that the agreement between microscopic examination and nested PCR was 87.3% (261/299). Nested PCR successfully detected 38 Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax infections, which were missed in microscopic examination. Microscopic examinations also either misdiagnosed the infected Plasmodium species, or did not detect mixed infections with different Plasmodium species in 31 cases.
   Conclusions: The nested PCR method is more reliable than conventional microscopic examination for the diagnosis of malaria infections, and this is particularly true in cases of mixed infections and submicroscopic infections. Given the observed higher sensitivity and specificity of nested PCR, the molecular method holds enormous promise in malaria diagnosis and species differentiation, and can be applied as an effective monitoring tool for malaria surveillance, control and elimination in Myanmar.

TI False-negative malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Rwanda: impact of
   Plasmodium falciparum isolates lacking hrp2 and declining malaria
   transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for histidine rich protein 2(HRP2) are often used to determine whether persons with fever should be treated with anti-malarials. However, Plasmodium falciparum parasites with a deletion of the hrp2 gene yield false-negative RDTs and there are concerns the sensitivity of HRP2-based RDTs may fall when the intensity of transmission decreases.
   Methods: This observational study enrolled 9226 patients at three health centres in Rwanda from April 2014 to April 2015. It then compared the sensitivity of RDTs based on HRP2 and the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) to microscopy (thick smears) for the diagnosis of malaria. PCR was used to determine whether deletions of the histidinerich central repeat region of the hrp2 gene (exon 2) were associated with false-negative HRP2-based RDTs.
   Results: In comparison to microscopy, the sensitivity and specificity of HRP2-and pLDH-based RDTs were 89.5 and 86.2% and 80.2 and 94.3%, respectively. When the results for both RDTs were combined, sensitivity rose to 91.8% and specificity was 85.7%. Additionally, when smear positivity fell from 46 to 3%, the sensitivity of the HRP2-based RDT fell from 88 to 67%. Of 370 samples with false-negative HRP2 RDT results for which PCR was performed, 140 (38%) were identified as P. falciparum by PCR. Of the isolates identified as P. falciparum by PCR, 32 (23%) were negative for the hrp2 gene based on PCR. Of the 32 P. falciparum isolates negative for hrp2 by PCR, 17 (53%) were positive based on the pLDH RDT.
   Conclusion: This prospective study of RDT performance coincided with a decline in the intensity of malaria transmission in Kibirizi (fall in slide positivity from 46 to 3%). This decline was associated with a decrease in HRP2 RDT sensitivity (from 88 to 67%). While P. falciparum isolates without the hrp2 gene were an important cause of false-negative HRP2based RDTs, most were identified by the pLDH-based RDT. Although WHO does not recommend the use of combined HRP2/pLDH testing in sub-Saharan Africa, these results suggest that combination HRP2/pLDH- based RDTs could reduce the impact of false-negative HRP2-based RDTs for detection of symptomatic P. falciparum malaria.

TI Diagnostic challenges and case management of the first imported case of
   Plasmodium knowlesi in Sri Lanka
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Sri Lanka has achieved ' malaria-free ' status and is now in the phase of prevention of re-introduction of malaria. Imported malaria remains a challenge to resurgence of the disease. The diagnostic challenges encountered and the rapid response initiated to manage a Plasmodium infection, which was later confirmed as Plasmodium knowlesi, the first reported case from Sri Lanka, is discussed.
   Case presentation: An army officer who returned from Malaysia in October 2016 was found to be positive for Plasmodium both by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) by the Anti Malaria Campaign Sri Lanka (AMC) during his third visit to a health care provider. Microscopy findings were suspicious of P.knowlesi infection as the smears showed parasite stages similar to both Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium falciparum. Nested PCR at AMC confirmed Plasmodium genus, but not the species. In the absence of species confirmation, the patient was treated as a case of P.falciparum. The presence of P.knowlesi was later confirmed by a semi-nested PCR assay performed at the Environmental Health Institute, National Environmental Agency in Singapore. The parasite strain was also characterized by sequencing the circumsporozoite gene. Extensive case investigation including parasitological and entomological surveillance was carried out.
   Conclusions: Plasmodium knowlesi should be suspected in patients returning from countries in the South Asian region where the parasite is prevalent and when blood smear results are inconclusive.

TI Analytical sensitivity of current best-in-class malaria rapid diagnostic
   tests
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are today the most widely used method for malaria diagnosis and are recommended, alongside microscopy, for the confirmation of suspected cases before the administration of anti-malarial treatment. The diagnostic performance of RDTs, as compared to microscopy or PCR is well described but the actual analytical sensitivity of current best-in-class tests is poorly documented. This value is however a key performance indicator and a benchmark value needed to developed new RDTs of improved sensitivity.
   Methods: Thirteen RDTs detecting either the Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) or the plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigens were selected from the best performing RDTs according to the WHO-FIND product testing programme. The analytical sensitivity of these products was evaluated using a range of reference materials including P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax whole parasite samples as well as recombinant proteins.
   Results: The best performing HRP2-based RDTs could detect all P. falciparum cultured samples at concentrations as low as 0.8 ng/mL of HRP2. The limit of detection of the best performing pLDH-based RDT specifically detecting P. vivax was 25 ng/mL of pLDH.
   Conclusion: The analytical sensitivity of P. vivax and Pan pLDH-based RDTs appears to vary considerably from product to product, and improvement of the limit-of-detection for P. vivax detecting RDTs is needed to match the performance of HRP2 and Pf pLDH-based RDTs for P. falciparum. Different assays using different reference materials produce different values for antigen concentration in a given specimen, highlighting the need to establish universal reference assays.

TI Contribution of Plasmodium knowlesi to Multispecies Human Malaria
   Infections in North Sumatera, Indonesia
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. As Indonesia works toward the goal of malaria elimination, information is lacking on malaria epidemiology from some western provinces. As a basis for studies of antimalarial efficacy, we set out to survey parasite carriage in 3 communities in North Sumatera Province.
   Methods. A combination of active and passive detection of infection was carried out among communities in Batubara, Langkat, and South Nias regencies. Finger-prick blood samples from consenting individuals of all ages provided blood films for microscopic examination and blood spots on filter paper. Plasmodium species were identified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ribosomal RNA genes and a novel assay that amplifies a conserved sequence specific for the sicavar gene family of Plasmodium knowlesi.
   Results. Of 3731 participants, 614 (16.5%) were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy. PCR detected parasite DNA in samples from 1169 individuals (31.3%). In total, 377 participants (11.8%) harbored P. knowlesi. Also present were Plasmodium vivax (14.3%), Plasmodium falciparum (10.5%) and Plasmodium malariae (3.4%).
   Conclusions. Amplification of sicavar is a specific and sensitive test for the presence of P. knowlesi DNA in humans. Subpatent and asymptomatic multispecies parasitemia is relatively common in North Sumatera, so PCR-based surveillance is required to support control and elimination activities.

TI Cloning, characterization and transmission blocking potential of midgut
   carboxypeptidase A in Anopheles stephensi
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) interrupt malaria parasite transmission and hence form an important component for malaria eradication. Mosquito midgut exopeptidases such as aminopeptidase N & carboxypeptidase B have demonstrated TBV potential. In the present study, we cloned and characterized carboxypeptidase A (CPA) from the midgut of an important malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi. ClustalW amino acid alignment and in silico 3-dimensional structure analysis of CPA predicted the presence of active sites involved in zinc and substrate binding that are conserved among all the known mosquito species. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that CPA is predominantly expressed in the midgut throughout the mosquito life cycle and that this gene is significantly elevated in P. berghei-infected mosquitoes compared to uninfected blood-fed controls. The high midgut CPA activity correlated with the prominent mRNA levels observed. Peptide-based anti-CPA antibodies were raised that cross-reacted specifically to similar to 48 kDa and 37 kDa bands, which correspond to zymogen and active forms of CPA. Further, the addition of CPA directed antibodies to P. berghei-containing blood meal significantly reduced the mosquito infection rate in the test group compared to control and blocked the parasite development in the midgut. These results support further development of A. stephensi CPA as a candidate TBV. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Plasmodium malariae Prevalence and csp Gene Diversity, Kenya, 2014 and
   2015
SO EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB In Africa, control programs that target primarily Plasmodium falciparum are inadequate for eliminating malaria. To learn more about prevalence and genetic variability of P. malariae in Africa, we examined blood samples from 663 asymptomatic and 245 symptomatic persons from western Kenya during June-August of 2014 and 2015. P. malariae accounted for 5.3% (35/663) of asymptomatic infections and 3.3% (8/245) of clinical cases. Among asymptomatic persons, 71% (32/45) of P. malariae infections detected by PCR were undetected by microscopy. The low sensitivity of microscopy probably results from the significantly lower parasitemia of P. malariae. Analyses of P. malariae circumsporozoite protein gene sequences revealed high genetic diversity among P. malariae in Africa, but no clear differentiation among geographic populations was observed. Our findings suggest that P. malariae should be included in the malaria elimination strategy in Africa and highlight the need for sensitive and field- applicable methods to identify P. malariae in malaria- endemic areas.

TI Efficacy of artesunate plus sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemether
   plus lumefantrine and dhfr and dhps mutations in Somalia: evidence for
   updating the malaria treatment policy
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB objective To determine the therapeutic efficacy of artesunate + sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS + SP) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL), and to investigate the presence of molecular mutations associated with resistance, to inform national malaria treatment policy.
   methods One-arm prospective studies were conducted in three study sites in Somalia in 2013 and 2015 to evaluate the efficacy of AS + SP and AL among patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Outcomes included clinical and parasitological response over 28 days, and the presence of dihydrofolate reductase (dfhr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and mutations. results Among patients treated with AS + SP, the PCR-corrected treatment failure rate was 12.3%. The majority of patients (89%) carried either the quintuple mutations (51I/108N + 437G/540E/581G or 51I/59R/108N + 437G/540E) or the quadruple mutation (51I/108N + 437G/540E). All patients who failed treatment with AS + SP carried the quintuple mutation (51I/108N + 437G/540E/581G). In the studies of AL, the PCR-corrected treatment failure rate was < 6%. All patients in both treatment groups cleared their parasitaemia by day 3.
   conclusions The findings demonstrate a failing first-line treatment (AS + SP), with a failure rate above the threshold (10%) for policy change, and a high prevalence of quintuple mutations. In contrast, AL was highly efficacious. Based on these findings and the results from a previous AS + SP study, AL was selected to replace AS + SP as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Somalia in 2016. Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (DHA + PPQ) has been recommended as the second-line treatment. Routine monitoring of recommended ACTs should continue to inform treatment policy.

TI Plasmodium knowlesi and human malaria parasites in Khan Phu, Vietnam:
   Gametocyte production in humans and frequent co-infection of mosquitoes
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB Four species of malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi infect humans living in the Khanh Phu commune, Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. The latter species also infects wild macaque monkeys in this region. In order to understand the transmission dynamics of the three species, we attempted to detect gametocytes of the three species in the blood of infected individuals, and sporozoites in the salivary glands of mosquitoes from the same region. For the detection of gametocyte-specific mRNA, we targeted region 3 of pfg377, pvs25, pmg and pks25 as indicators of the presence of P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi gametocytes, respectively. Gametocyte-specific mRNA was present in 37, 61, 0 and 47% of people infected with P. falciparum (n = 95), P. vivax (n = 69), P. malariae (n = 6) or P. knowlesi (n = 32), respectively. Wefound that 70% of mosquitoes that had P. knowlesi in their salivary glands also carried human malaria parasites, suggesting that mosquitoes are infected with P. knowlesi from human infections.

TI Contribution of real-time PCR to Plasmodium species identification and
   to clinical decisions: a nationwide study in a non-endemic setting
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Treatment choice for patients with malaria in Israeli hospitals is based on microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Here, we demonstrate the cumulative value of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in optimizing the treatment of malaria. Between January 2009 and December 2015, 451 samples from 357 patients were tested in our laboratory using a real-time PCR assay. Hospital laboratory results (without real-time PCR) were compared to those obtained in our laboratory. A total of 307 patients had a malaria-positive laboratory finding in the hospital. Out of those, 288 were confirmed positive and 19 negative using real-time PCR. Two negative hospital results were found to be positive by real-time PCR. More specifically, of 153 cases positive for Plasmodium falciparum by real-time PCR, only 138 (90%) had been correctly identified at the hospitals. Similarly, 66 (67%) of 99 cases positive for P. vivax, 2 (11%) of 18 cases positive for P. ovale, and 3 (30%) of 10 cases positive for P. malariae had been correctly identified. Of 10 cases of mixed infection, only one had been identified as such at the hospital. Thus, real-time PCR was required for correct identification in 81 (28%) out of 290 positive cases. In 52 (18%) of those, there was an erroneous categorization of relapsing versus non-relapsing parasites. In a nationwide study, we found that the use of real-time PCR is definitely beneficial and may change the decision regarding the choice of treatment.

TI A combined strategy for screening a clustered mobile population
   returning from highly endemic areas for Plasmodium falciparum
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB Introduction: Early and accurate diagnosis of imported malaria cases in clusters is crucial for protecting the health of patients and local populations, especially confirmed parasitic persons who are asymptomatic.
   Methodology: A total of 226 gold miners who had stayed in highly endemic areas of Ghana for more than six months and returned in clusters were selected randomly. Blood samples from them were tested with microscopy, nest polymerase chain reaction, and rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, agreement rate, and Youden's index of each of three diagnostic methods were calculated and compared with the defined gold standard. A quick and efficient way to respond to screening such a clustered mobile population was predicted and analyzed by evaluating two assumed results of combining microscopy and RDT with or without symptoms of illness.
   Results: The rate of the carriers of malaria parasites in the populations of gold miners was 19.47%, including 39 P. falciparum. Among the three diagnostic methods, the microscopy method showed the highest specificity, while the RDT method showed the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity in detecting P. falciparum. The assumed results of combining RDT and microscopy with symptoms showed the best results among all the test results in screening P. falciparum.
   Conclusions: It was too complex and difficult to catch all parasite carriers in a short period of time among populations with such a complicated situation as that in Shanglin County. A strategy of combing microscopy and RDT for diagnosis is highly recommended.

SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB The present study was carried out in 26 villages at two Governates (Al-Khobah, and Haroob) in Jazan Region in Southwest Saudi Arabia to identify and detect the presence of Plasmodium in Anopheles arabiensis using nested-PCR technique. An. Arabiensis was identified by PCR and it was the predominant Anopheles mosquito in all the collection sites. A total of 257 An. Arabiensis females were collected and two samples from two villages (Almuatan and Alsabkha) out of 107 (1.87%) female mosquitoes from Haroob Governate were found positive for the sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum. Similarly, 3 out of 150 (2%) female mosquito samples from Um-alkhameir, AL-Khobah Governate, were also found positive. Around fourfold increase of thesporozoite rate (from 0.61 to 2.0%) in An. arabiens is in AL-Khobah Governate has been observed compared to the previous study of 2007-2008. The wide spread of An. arabiensis in Jazan region with >90% of the malaria cases caused by P. falciparum, along with infectivity rate ranges between 1.87 to 2.0% for P. falciparum in Al-Khobah and Haroob Governates, suggests that P. falciparum is the most predominant malaria parasite and An. Arabiensis is a very efficient malaria vector in the region. It also suggestsmore in-depth researches on the ecology, behavior, and control of An. Arabiensis to promote area-specific control programs.

TI Identification of Plasmodium species from outdated blood samples by
   nested-PCR compared with microscopy diagnosis in Jazan region, Saudi
   Arabia
SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Precise diagnosis of plasmodium species is essential for accurate and prompt malaria control and elimination. The present study was conducted to assess the efficiency of malaria parasites' diagnosis by microscopy and nested-PCR techniques in Jazan region. Eight hundred eighty four samples were collected from hospitals and malaria control centers of the eleven Governates of Jazan region to confirm their microscopy diagnosis for Plasmodium species. One hundred thirty eight (15.6%) samples were randomly selected from the saved positive microscopy confirmed samples. The samples were re-diagnosed by microscopy for plasmodium species and found positive for two plasmodium species (128 for P. falciparum [92.8%] and 10 for P. vivax [7.2%]). But no other plasmodium species or mixed-infections were detected. On other hand, the diagnosis by nested-PCR indicated 119 (86.23%) and 6 (4.35%) mono infection by P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. In addition, the method detected also 13 (9.42%) mixed-infections with both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Considerable numbers of species mismatch and under-reporting of mixed infections had been noticed in the diagnosis of malaria by microscopy alone in Jazan region. The nested-PCR is valuable technique as a confi rmatory test and should be considered by reference laboratories in the region and other malaria endemic regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

TI Asymptomatic and sub-microscopic malaria infection in Kayah State,
   eastern Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Myanmar has the heaviest burden of malaria in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. Asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infections are common in this region and may represent an important reservoir of transmission that must be targeted for malaria elimination.
   Methods: A mass blood survey was conducted among 485 individuals from six villages in Kayah State, an area of endemic but low transmission malaria in eastern Myanmar. Malaria infection was screened by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), light microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and its association with demographic factors was explored.
   Results: The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infection was 2.3% (11/485) by real-time PCR. Plasmodium vivax accounted for 72.7% (8/11) and Plasmodium falciparum for 27.3% (3/11) of infections. Men were at greater risk of infection by Plasmodium spp. than women. Individuals who worked as farmers or wood and bamboo cutters had an increased risk of infection.
   Conclusion: A combination of RDT, light microscopy and PCR diagnostics were used to identify asymptomatic malaria infection, providing additional information on asymptomatic cases in addition to the routine statistics on symptomatic cases, so as to determine the true burden of disease in the area. Such information and risk factors can improve malaria risk stratification and guide decision-makers towards better design and delivery of targeted interventions in small villages, representative of Kayah State.

TI Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with drug
   resistance in Hodh Elgharbi, a malaria hotspot near Malian-Mauritanian
   border
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: A malaria hotspot in the southeastern region of Mauritania, near the Malian border, may hamper malaria control strategies. The objectives were to estimate the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates and establish baseline data.
   Methods: The study was conducted in two malaria-endemic areas in Hodh Elgharbi, situated in the Malian-Mauritanian border area. Blood samples were collected from symptomatic patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, and Pfdhps were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA sequencing and primer extension. The Pfmdr1 gene copy number was determined by real-time PCR.
   Results: Of 280 P. falciparum-infected patients, 193 (68.9%) carried the Pfcrt 76T mutant allele. The Pfmdr1 86Y and 184F mutations were found in 61 (23.1%) of 264 isolates and 167 (67.6%) of 247 samples that were successfully genotyped, respectively. Pfmdr1 mutant alleles 1034C, 1042D and 1246Y were rarely observed. Of 102 P. falciparum isolates analysed, ten (9.8%) had more than one copy of Pfmdr1 gene. The prevalence of isolates harbouring at least triple mutant Pfdhfr 51I, 59R, 108 N/ T was 42% (112/ 268), of which 42 (37.5%) had an additional Pfdhps 437G mutation. The Pfdhps 540E mutation was observed in four isolates (1.5%), including three associated with Pfdhfr triple mutant. Only two quintuple mutants (Pfdhfr-51I-59R-108N Pfdhps-437G-540E) were observed.
   Conclusions: The observed mutations in Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, and Pfcrt may jeopardize the future of seasonal malaria chemoprevention based on amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine. Complementary studies should be carried out to document the distribution, origin and circulation of P. falciparum populations in this region and more widely in the country to assess the risk of the spread of resistance.

TI Therapeutic efficacy and artemisinin resistance in northern Myanmar:
   evidence from in vivo and molecular marker studies
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In Myanmar, three types of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are recommended as first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria: artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-mefloquine (AS + MQ), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Resistance to both artemisinins and ACT partner drugs has been reported from the Greater Mekong Sub-region, and regular efficacy monitoring of the recommended ACT is conducted in Myanmar. This paper reports on results from studies to monitor the efficacy of the three forms of ACT in sentinel sites in northern Myanmar, and investigations of mutations in the Kelch13 (k13) propeller domain.
   Methods: Seven therapeutic efficacy studies were conducted in 2011-12 and 2014 in three sentinel sites in Myanmar (Tamu, Muse, Tabeikkyin). Three studies were done for the evaluation of AL (204 patients), two studies for AS + MQ (119 patients) and two studies for DP (147 patients). These studies were done according to 2009 standard WHO protocol. Polymorphisms in the k13 propeller domain were examined in dried blood spots collected on day 0. The primary endpoint was adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28 for AL and on day 42 for DP and AS + MQ, corrected to exclude re-infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Safety data were collected through self-reporting.
   Results: PCR-corrected ACPR was 97.2-100% for AL, 98.6-100% for AS + MQ and 100% for DP across the study sites and years. All studies found a prevalence of k13 mutations (>440) above 23% in the day-0 samples. The F446I mutation was the most common mutation, making up 66.0% of the mutations found. Seven out of nine day-3 positive patients were infected with k13 wild type parasites. The remaining two cases with day-3 parasitaemia had the P574L mutation.
   Conclusions: The efficacy of AL, AS + MQ and DP remains high in northern Myanmar despite widespread evidence of k13 mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance. This study showed that already in 2012 there was a high frequency of k13 mutations in Myanmar on the border with India. The high efficacy of the recommended ACT gives confidence in the continued recommendation of the use of these treatments in Myanmar.

TI Impact of metric and sample size on determining malaria hotspot
   boundaries
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The spatial heterogeneity of malaria suggests that interventions may be targeted for maximum impact. It is unclear to what extent different metrics lead to consistent delineation of hotspot boundaries. Using data from a large community-based malaria survey in the western Kenyan highlands, we assessed the agreement between a model-based geostatistical (MBG) approach to detect hotspots using Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence and serological evidence for exposure. Malaria transmission was widespread and highly heterogeneous with one third of the total population living in hotspots regardless of metric tested. Moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.424) was observed between hotspots defined based on parasite prevalence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and the prevalence of antibodies to two P. falciparum antigens (MSP-1, AMA-1). While numerous biologically plausible hotspots were identified, their detection strongly relied on the proportion of the population sampled. When only 3% of the population was sampled, no PCR derived hotspots were reliably detected and at least 21% of the population was needed for reliable results. Similar results were observed for hotspots of seroprevalence. Hotspot boundaries are driven by the malaria diagnostic and sample size used to inform the model. These findings warn against the simplistic use of spatial analysis on available data to target malaria interventions in areas where hotspot boundaries are uncertain.

TI Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in the
   Republic of Congo: four and nine years after the introduction of
   artemisinin-based combination therapy
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Resistance to anti-malarial drugs hinders efforts on malaria elimination and eradication. Following the global spread of chloroquine-resistant parasites, the Republic of Congo adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2006 as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. To assess the impacts after implementation of ACT, a molecular surveillance for anti-malarial drug resistance was conducted in Congo 4 and 9 years after the introduction of ACT.
   Methods: Blood samples of 431 febrile children aged 1-10 years were utilized from two previous studies conducted in 2010 (N = 311) and 2015 (N = 120). All samples were screened for malaria parasites using nested PCR. Direct sequencing was used to determine the frequency distribution of genetic variants in the anti-malarial drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum genes (Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfatp6, Pfk13) in malaria-positive isolates.
   Results: One-hundred and nineteen (N = 70 from 2010 and N = 49 from 2015) samples were positive for P. falciparum. A relative decrease in the proportion of chloroquine-resistant haplotype (CVIET) from 100% in 2005, 1 year before the introduction and implementation of ACT in 2006, to 98% in 2010 to 71% in 2015 was observed. Regarding the multidrug transporter gene, a considerable reduction in the frequency of the mutations N86Y (from 73 to 27%) and D1246Y (from 22 to 0%) was observed. However, the prevalence of the Y184F mutation remained stable (49% in 2010 compared to 54% in 2015). Isolates carrying the Pfatp6 H243Y was 25% in 2010 and this frequency was reduced to null in 2015. None of the parasites harboured the Pfk13 mutations associated with prolonged artemisinin clearance in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, 13 new Pfk13 variants are reported among the investigated isolates.
   Conclusion: The implementation of ACT has led to the decline in prevalence of chloroquine-resistant parasites in the Republic of Congo. However, the constant prevalence of the PfMDR1 Y184F mutation, associated with lumefantrine susceptibility, indicate a selective drug pressure still exists. Taken together, this study could serve as the basis for epidemiological studies monitoring the distribution of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance in the Republic of Congo.

TI Four human Plasmodium species quantification using droplet digital PCR
SO PLOS ONE
AB Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a partial PCR based on water-oil emulsion droplet technology. It is a highly sensitive method for detecting and delineating minor alleles from complex backgrounds and provides absolute quantification of DNA targets. The ddPCR technology has been applied for detection of many pathogens. Here the sensitive assay utilizing ddPCR for detection and quantification of Plasmodium species was investigated. The assay was developed for two levels of detection, genus specific for all Plasmodium species and for specific Plasmodium species detection. The ddPCR assay was developed based on primers and probes specific to the Plasmodium genus 18S rRNA gene. Using ddPCR for ultra-sensitive P. falciparum assessment, the lower level of detection from concentrated DNA obtained from a high volume (1 mL) blood sample was 11 parasites/mL. For species identification, in particular for samples with mixed infections, a duplex reaction was developed for detection and quantification P. falciparum/ P. vivax and P. malariae/ P. ovale. Amplification of each Plasmodium species in the duplex reaction showed equal sensitivity to singleplex single species detection. The duplex ddPCR assay had higher sensitivity to identify minor species in 32 subpatent parasitaemia samples from Cambodia, and performed better than real-time PCR. The ddPCR assay shows high sensitivity to assess very low parasitaemia of all human Plasmodium species. This provides a useful research tool for studying the role of the asymptomatic parasite reservoir for transmission in regions aiming for malaria elimination.

TI Assessment of copy number variation in genes related to drug resistance
   in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the
   Brazilian Amazon and a systematic review of the literature
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Parasite resistance to anti-malarials represents a great obstacle for malaria elimination. The majority of studies have investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and drug resistance; however, it is becoming clear that the copy number variation (CNV) is also associated with this parasite phenotype. To provide a baseline for molecular surveillance of anti-malarial drug resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, the present study characterized the genetic profile of both markers in the most common genes associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax isolates. Additionally, these data were compared to data published elsewhere applying a systematic review of the literature published over a 20-year time period.
   Methods: The genomic DNA of 67 patients infected by P. falciparum and P. vivax from three Brazilian States was obtained between 2002 and 2012. CNV in P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1 (pfmdr1), GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) and P. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) were assessed by real-time PCR assays. SNPs in the pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes were assessed by PCR-RFLP. A literature search for studies that analysed CNP in the same genes of P. falciparum and P. vivax was conducted between May 2014 and March 2017 across four databases.
   Results: All analysed samples of P. falciparum carried only one copy of pfmdr1 or pfgch1. Although the pfcrt K76T polymorphism, a determinant of CQ resistance, was present in all samples genotyped, the pfmdr1 N86Y was absent. For P. vivax isolates, an amplification rate of 20% was found for the pvmdr1 gene. The results of the study are in agreement with the low amplification rates for pfmdr1 gene evidenced in the Americas and Africa, while higher rates have been described in Southeast Asia. For P. vivax, very low rates of amplification for pvmdr1 have been described worldwide, with exceptions in French Guiana, Cambodia, Thailand and Brazil.
   Conclusions: The present study was the first to evaluate gch1 CNV in P. falciparum isolates from Brazil, showing an absence of amplification of this gene more than 20 years after the withdrawal of the Brazilian antifolates therapeutic scheme. Furthermore, the rate of pvmdr1 amplification was significantly higher than that previously reported for isolates circulating in Northern Brazil.

TI High resolution melting: a useful field-deployable method to measure
   dhfr and dhps drug resistance in both highly and lowly endemic
   Plasmodium populations
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Emergence and spread of drug resistance to every anti-malarial used to date, creates an urgent need for development of sensitive, specific and field-deployable molecular tools for detection and surveillance of validated drug resistance markers. Such tools would allow early detection of mutations in resistance loci. The aim of this study was to compare common population signatures and drug resistance marker frequencies between two populations with different levels of malaria endemicity and history of anti-malarial drug use: Tanzania and Senegal. This was accomplished by implementing a high resolution melting assay to study molecular markers of drug resistance as compared to polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) methodology.
   Methods: Fifty blood samples were collected each from a lowly malaria endemic site (Senegal), and a highly malaria endemic site (Tanzania) from patients presenting with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria at clinic. Data representing the DHFR were derived using both PCR-RFLP and HRM assay; while genotyping data representing the DHPS were evaluated in Senegal and Tanzania using HRM. Msp genotyping analysis was used to characterize the multiplicity of infection in both countries.
   Results: A high prevalence of samples harbouring mutant DHFR alleles was observed in both population using both genotyping techniques. HRM was better able to detect mixed alleles compared to PCR/RFLP for DHFR codon 51 in Tanzania; and only HRM was able to detect mixed infections from Senegal. A high prevalence of mutant alleles in DHFR (codons 51, 59, 108) and DHPS (codon 437) were found among samples from Senegal while no mutations were observed at DHPS codons 540 and 581, from both countries. Overall, the frequency of samples harbouring either a single DHFR mutation (S108N) or double mutation in DHFR (C59R/S108N) was greater in Senegal compared to Tanzania.
   Conclusion: Here the results demonstrate that HRM is a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable alternative technique to PCR-RFLP genotyping that is useful in populations harbouring more than one parasite genome (polygenomic infections). In this study, a high levels of resistance polymorphisms was observed in both dhfr and dhps, among samples from Tanzania and Senegal. A routine monitoring by molecular markers can be a way to detect emergence of resistance involving a change in the treatment policy.

AB Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), together with other control measures, have reduced the burden of falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan countries, including Sudan. Sudan adopted ACT in 2004 with a remarkable reduction in mortality due to falciparum malaria. However, emergence of resistance to the first-line treatment artesunate and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS/SP) has created new challenges to the control of malaria in Sudan. A search for an alternative drug of choice for treating uncomplicated malaria has become inevitable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) and AS/SP in an area of unstable transmission in Blue Nile State, Sudan in 2015-16.
   Methods: A total of 148 patients with uncomplicated malaria were recruited in the study from November 2015 to end of January 2016. Seventy-five patients received DHA-PPQ while 73 received AS/SP. Patients were monitored for clinical and parasitological outcomes following the standard WHO protocol for a period of 42 days for DHA-PPQ and 28 days for AS/SP; nested PCR (nPCR) was performed to confirm parasite re-appearance from day 7 onwards.
   Results: Fifty-five patients completed the DHA-PPQ arm protocol with success cure rate of 98.2% (95% CI 90.3-100%) and one late clinical failure 1.8% (95% CI 0.0-9.7%). The AS/SP showed adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) of 83.6% (95% CI 71.9-91.8%), early treatment failure was 1.6% (95% CI 0.0-8.8%) and late parasitological failure (LPF) was 14.8% (95% CI 7-26.2%). The respective PCR uncorrected LPF was 20%.
   Conclusion: DHA-PPQ is an efficacious ACT and candidate for replacement of first-line treatment in Sudan while AS/ SP showed high treatment failure rate and must be replaced.

TI Comparison of methods for detecting asymptomatic malaria infections in
   the China-Myanmar border area
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Sensitive methods for detecting asymptomatic malaria infections are essential for identifying potential transmission reservoirs and obtaining an accurate assessment of malaria epidemiology in low-endemicity areas aiming to eliminate malaria. PCR techniques to detect parasite nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) are among the most commonly used molecular methods. However, most of these methods are of low throughput and cannot be used for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies. A recently developed capture and ligation probe-PCR (CLIP-PCR) is claimed to have the sensitivity of molecular techniques and the high throughput capacity needed for screening purposes. This study aimed to compare several molecular methods for detecting asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium infections in healthy residents of a malaria-hypoendemic region in Southeast Asia, where malaria elimination is in sight.
   Method: This study compared three molecular detection methods side-by-side, namely nested PCR targeting the rRNA genes, nested RT-PCR to detect parasite rRNA, and CLIP-PCR to detect parasite rRNA in 1005 healthy individuals in northeastern Myanmar. For nested PCR and RT-PCR, parasite DNA and total RNA were extracted from similar to 100 mu L of blood, whereas RNA used for CLIP-PCR was from a 3 mm disk of dried blood filter paper. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods were compared with those of conventional light microscopy. In addition, RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting the Pvs25 gene in Plasmodium vivax were used to assess gametocyte prevalence in the samples.
   Results: Light microscopy detected Plasmodium infections in only 1.19% of the residents harbouring the parasites. CLIP-PCR had slightly better performance and detected Plasmodium infections in 1.89% of the population. Further improvement was achieved by nested PCR to detect parasite DNA, which detected P.vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections in 2.39% of the residents. The nested RT-PCR targeting rRNA, however, detected as many as 187 (18.61%) individuals having Plasmodium infections with P. vivax being the predominant species (176 P. vivax, 5 P. falciparum and 6 P. falciparum/P.vivax mixed infections). Of the 210 Plasmodium-positive samples detected by all molecular methods, 115 were Pvs25-positive by qRT-PCR, indicating that a large proportion of asymptomatic individuals were gametocyte carriers.
   Conclusion: Nested RT-PCR based on the detection of asexual-stage parasite rRNA was the most sensitive, with a more than sixfold higher sensitivity than the other two molecular methods of parasite detection. CLIP-PCR has an increased throughput, but its sensitivity in this study was much lower than those of other molecular methods, which may be partially due to the smaller amount of RNA input used.

TI A no film slot blot for the detection of developing P. falciparum
   oocysts in mosquitoes
SO PLOS ONE
AB Non-microscopy-based assays for sensitive and rapid detection of Plasmodium infection in mosquitoes are needed to allow rapid and high throughput measurement of transmission intensity and malaria control program effectiveness. Here, we report on a modified enhanced chemiluminescence-based slot blot assay for detection of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozite protein (PfCSP) expressed on parasite oocysts developing inside the mosquito midgut. This modified assay has several novel features that include eliminating the need for exposure to autoradiography (AR) film, as well as utilizing a novel high affinity anti-CSP antibody, and optimizing assay procedures resulting in significant reduction in the time required to perform the assay. The chemiluminescent signal for the detection of PfCSP in mosquito samples was captured digitally utilizing the C-Digit blot scanner that, allowed the detection of 0.01 pg of recombinant P. falciparum CSP and as few as 0.02 P. falciparum oocysts in a little over two hours. The earlier ECL-SB detected rCSP and oocysts and took approximately 5 h to perform. Whole mosquito lysates from both high and low prevalence-infected mosquito populations were prepared and evaluated for PfCSP detection on the ECL-SB by both AR film and digital data capture and analysis. There was a 100% agreement between the AR film and the C-Digit scanner methods for PfCSP detection in randomly sampled mosquitoes. This novel "No Film" Slot Blot assay obviates the need for AR film exposure and development and significantly reduces the assay time enabling widespread use in field settings.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections in
   a highland district in Ghana, and the influence of HIV and sickle cell
   disease
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In the past two decades, there has been a reported decline in malaria in Ghana and the rest of the world; yet it remains the number one cause of mortality and morbidity. Human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and sickle cell disease (SCD) share a common geographical space with malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and an interaction between these three conditions has been suggested. This study determined the Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum status of symptomatic and non-symptomatic residents of Mpraeso in the highlands of Kwahu-South district of Ghana based on evidence of current national decline. The influence of HIV and SCD on malaria was also determined.
   Methods: Participants were 354 symptomatic patients visiting the Kwahu Government Hospital and 360 asymptomatic residents of the district capital. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the minor rainy season (October-December 2014). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), blood film microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction assessment of blood were done. Participants who tested positive with RDT were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy; and assessment of venous blood was repeated 7 days after treatment. HIV screening and haemoglobin genotyping was done. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the influence of SCD and HIV.
   Results: Plasmodium falciparum was prevalent at 124/142 (87.3%). Plasmodium malariae was the only non-falciparum species detected at 18/142 (12.7%). HIV and SCD did not significantly increase odds of malaria infection. However, the use of ITN and recent anti-malarial intake significantly decreased the odds of being malaria infected by 0.45-fold and 0.46-fold respectively.
   Conclusion: Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae infection are the prevailing species in the study area; albeit varying from the national average. HIV and SCD were not associated with the risk of having malaria.

TI Molecular identification of Plasmodium spp. and blood meal sources of
   anophelines in environmental reserves on Sao LuIs Island, state of
   Maranhao, Brazil
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Considering the diversity of feeding habits that females of some species of anophelines present, it is important to understand which vertebrates are part of blood food sources and how important is the role of each in the ecoepidemiology of malaria. There are many vector species for Plasmodium spp. in the State of Maranhao, Brazil. In Sao Luis Island, Anopheles aquasalis is the main vector for human malaria; this species is abundant in areas with primates that are positive for Plasmodium. Anopheles aquasalis has natural exophilic and zoophilic feeding behavior, but in cases of high density and absence of animals, presents quite varied behavior, and feeds on human blood. In this context, the objective of the present study was to identify Plasmodium spp. and the blood meal sources of anophelines in two environmental reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of Maranhao, using molecular methods.
   Methods: Between June and July 2013, female anophelines were collected in the Sitio Aguahy Private Reserve, in the municipality of Sao Josee de Ribamar, and in the Sitio Mangalho Reserve, located within the Maracana Environmental Protection Area, in the municipality of Sao Luis. CDC-type light traps, Shannon traps and protected human bait were used during three consecutive hours in peridomesticand wooded areas. Pools of anophelines were formed using mosquitoes of the same species that had been caught at the same site on the same date. A genus-specific amplification protocol based on the 18S rRNA gene was used for qPCR and cPCR.
   Results: A total of 416 anophelines were collected, of the following species: An. aquasalis (399), An. mediopunctatus (3), An. shannoni (1), An. nuneztovari (sensu lato) (1), An. goeldii (1), An. evansae (2) and An. (Nyssorhynchus) sp. (9), comprising 54 pools. Two pools were positive for Plasmodium (2/ 54) based on the 18S rRNA gene. In the phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method, based on a 240 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, it was found that the sequences of Plasmodium sp. amplified from pools of An. aquasalis (pool 2) and An. nuneztovari (s.l.) (pool 10) were phylogenetically related to a clade of P. falciparum isolates from India, and to a clade of Plasmodium sp. isolates from psittacines in Brazil, respectively. Cat, dog and human DNA were identified in the blood meals of the anophelines sampled.
   Conclusion: The species An. aquasalis was the most abundant anopheline species in Sao Luis Island. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected, thus confirming the importance of this species as the main vector on Sao Luis Island, Brazil. In addition, the presence of An. nuneztovari (s.l.) with DNA positive for Plasmodium spp. confirms its importance as a secondary vector.

TI Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine against uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a high-transmission area in northwest
   Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
AB Malaria, particularly due to Plasmodium falciparum, remains a major public health threat in Ethiopia. Artemether-lumefantine (AL) has been the first-line antimalarial drug against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the country since 2004. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drugs is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help early detection of drug resistant strains of the parasite and contain their rapid spread. The objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of AL in a high-transmission setting in Ethiopia. The study site was Setit Humera, northwest Ethiopia. Single-arm prospective study of a 28-day follow-up was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015 according to the revised WHO 2009 drug efficacy study protocol. Study end-points were classified into primary end-point and secondary end-point. While the primary end-point was the day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response the secondary end-points were clinical and parasitological evaluations (parasite, fever and gametocyte clearance rate, incidence of drug adverse events) and the relative increment in hemoglobin (Hb)level from baseline to day (D) 14 and D28. A total of 92 patients were enrolled and 79 had completed the 28-day follow-up period. The overall cure rate was 98.8% with 95% confidence interval of 0.915- 0.998 without polymerase chain reaction correction. The parasite clearance rate was high with fast resolution of clinical symptoms; 100% of the study participants cleared parasitaemia and fever on D3. Gametocyte carriage was reduced from 7% on D0 to 1% on D3 and complete clearance was achieved on D14. Mean Hb concentration significantly increased on D28 compared to that on D14. There was no serious adverse event. AL was efficacious and safe in a high-transmission setting for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

TI Increase in the prevalence of mutations associated with
   sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates
   collected from early to late pregnancy in Nanoro, Burkina Faso
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Pregnant women are a high-risk group for Plasmodium falciparum infections, which may result in maternal anaemia and low birth weight newborns, among other adverse birth outcomes. Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) is widely implemented to prevent these negative effects of malaria. However, resistance against SP by P. falciparum may decrease efficacy of IPTp-SP. Combinations of point mutations in the dhps (codons A437, K540) and dhfr genes (codons N51, C59, S108) of P. falciparum are associated with SP resistance. In this study the prevalence of SP resistance mutations was determined among P. falciparum found in pregnant women and the general population (GP) from Nanoro, Burkina Faso and the association of IPTp-SP dosing and other variables with mutations was studied.
   Methods: Blood spots on filter papers were collected from pregnant women at their first antenatal care visit (ANC booking) and at delivery, from an ongoing trial and from the GP in a cross-sectional survey. The dhps and dhfr genes were amplified by nested PCR and products were sequenced to identify mutations conferring resistance (ANC booking, n = 400; delivery, n = 223; GP, n = 400). Prevalence was estimated with generalized estimating equations and for multivariate analyses mixed effects logistic regression was used.
   Results: The prevalence of the triple dhfr mutation was high, and significantly higher in the GP and at delivery than at ANC booking, but it did not affect birth weight. Furthermore, quintuple mutations (triple dhfr and double dhps mutations) were found for the first time in Burkina Faso. IPTp-SP did not significantly affect the occurrence of any of the mutations, but high transmission season was associated with increased mutation prevalence in delivery samples. It is unclear why the prevalence of mutations was higher in the GP than in pregnant women at ANC booking.
   Conclusion: The high number of mutants and the presence of quintuple mutants in Burkina Faso confirm concerns about the efficacy of IPTp-SP in the near future. Other drug combinations to tackle malaria in pregnancy should, therefore, be explored. An increase in mutation prevalence due to IPTp-SP dosing could not be confirmed.

TI The Malaria TaqMan Array Card Includes 87 Assays for Plasmodium
   falciparum Drug Resistance, Identification of Species, and Genotyping in
   a Single Reaction
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Antimalarial drug resistance exacerbates the global disease burden and complicates eradication efforts. To facilitate the surveillance of resistance markers in countries of malaria endemicity, we developed a suite of TaqMan assays for known resistance markers and compartmentalized them into a single array card (TaqMan array card, TAC). We included 87 assays for species identification, for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum mutations associated with chloroquine, atovaquone, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and artemisinin resistance, and for neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Assay performance was first optimized using DNA from common laboratory parasite lines and plasmid controls. The limit of detection was 0.1 to 10 pg of DNA and yielded 100% accuracy compared to sequencing. The tool was then evaluated on 87 clinical blood samples from around the world, and the malaria TAC once again achieved 100% accuracy compared to sequencing and in addition detected the presence of mixed infections in clinical samples. With its streamlined protocol and high accuracy, this malaria TAC should be a useful tool for large-scale antimalarial resistance surveillance.

TI Oil-Fortified Maize Porridge Increases Absorption of Lumefantrine in
   Children with Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria
SO BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY
AB Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Absorption of lumefantrine (LUM) is fat dependent, and in children, intake is recommended with milk. We investigated whether oil-fortified maize porridge can be an alternative when milk is not available. In an open-label pharmacokinetic study, Ugandan children <5 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomized to receive standard six-dose AL treatment [one tablet (20 mgA/120 mg LUM) if <15 kg and two tablets if >15 kg] with milk (A) or maize porridge plus oil (B). Parametric two-sample t-test was used to compare relative oral LUM bioavailability. The primary end-point was LUM exposure till 8 hr after the first dose (AUC(0-8 hr)). Secondary outcome included day 7 concentrations (d7(LUM)), LUM exposure between days 7 and 28 (AUC(d7-28)) and day 28 PCR-adjusted parasitological response. Evaluable children (n = 33) included 16 in arm A and 17 in arm B. The AUC(0-8 hr) was comparable between A and B [geometric mean (95% CI): 6.01 (3.26-11.1) versus 6.26 (4.5-8.43) hr*g/mL, p = 0.9]. Less interindividual variability in AUC(0-8 hr) was observed in B (p = 0.01), but d7(LUM) and AUC(d7-28) were comparable. Children receiving two tablets had significantly higher exposure than those receiving one tablet [median d7(LUM) (505 versus 289 ng/mL, p = 0.02) and AUC(d7-28) (108 versus 41 hr*g/mL, p = 0.006)]. One parasitological failure (d28 recrudescence) was observed. Our findings suggest that oil-fortified maize porridge can be an alternative to milk in augmenting absorption of LUM. The lower LUM exposure observed in children dosed with one AL tablet needs further attention.

TI The effect and mechanism of inhibiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
   activity on the proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
AB We screened >40,000 patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and found that the G6PD Kaiping allele was under the most positive selection for fighting against malaria in the Chinese population. However, the mechanism is unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the anti-malarial effect and mechanism of G6PD deficiency. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was utilised for inhibiting the G6PD activity of erythrocytes. Giemsa staining of blood smears and quantitative real-time PCR were used for the detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum infection. A transmission electron microscope was used to observe the structural changes of P. falciparum. An atomic force microscopy was used for the analyses of morphology, roughness and Young's Modulus of the infective erythrocyte membrane. When G6PD activity was inhibited by DHEA, the infection rate of P. falciparum decreased, its cell nucleus shrank, the cell organelles and metabolites were reduced gradually and the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane increased with increasing DHEA concentrations. These data indicated that Plasmodium multiplication would be inhibited in G6PD deficient erythrocytes because the Plasmodium organelles could not obtain enough nutrients, including ribose-5-phosphate and the reducing equivalent, NADPH. Moreover, the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane increased, which resulted in an increased membrane stiffness and decreased deformation. It was difficult for the merozoites to invade erythrocytes through endocytosis. Understanding these points will have a major effect on searching for new anti-malarial drug targets.

TI Limitations of Rapid Diagnostic Testing in Patients with Suspected
   Malaria: A Diagnostic Accuracy Evaluation from Swaziland, a
   Low-Endemicity Country Aiming for Malaria Elimination
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The performance of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to evaluate suspected malaria in low-endemicity settings has not been well characterized.
   Methods. Using dried blood spot samples from patients with suspected malaria at 37 health facilities from 2012 to 2014 in the low-endemicity country of Swaziland, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein 2-based RDTs using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (nested PCR targeting the cytochrome b gene) and quantitative PCR as reference standards. To explore reasons for false-negative and/or false-positive results, we used pfhrp2/3-specific PCR and logistic regression analyses of potentially associated epidemiological factors.
   Results. From 1353 patients, 93.0% of RDT-positive (n = 185) and 31.2% of RDT-negative samples (n = 340) were available and selected for testing. Compared with nested PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of RDTs were 51.7%, 94.1%, 67.3%, and 89.1%, respectively. After exclusion of samples with parasite densities <100/mu L, which accounted for 75.7% of false-negative results and 33.3% of PCR-detectable infections, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 78.8%, 93.7%, 62.3%, and 97.1%. Deletions of pfhrp2 were not detected. False-positivity was more likely during the second year and was not associated with demographics, recent malaria, health facility testing characteristics, or potential DNA degradation.
   Conclusions. In the low-transmission setting of Swaziland, we demonstrated low sensitivity of RDT for malaria diagnosis, owing to an unexpectedly high proportion of low-density infection among symptomatic subjects. The PPV was also low, requiring further investigation. A more accurate point-of-care diagnostic may be needed to support malaria elimination efforts.

TI Spatial Distribution of Falciparum Malaria Infections in Zanzibar:
   Implications for Focal Drug Administration Strategies Targeting
   Asymptomatic Parasite Carriers
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Optimal use of mass/targeted screen-and-treat or mass or focal drug administration as malaria elimination strategies remains unclear. We therefore studied spatial distribution of Plasmodium falciparum infections to compare simulated effects of these strategies on reducing the parasite reservoir in a pre-elimination setting.
   Methods. P. falciparum rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and serological (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) analyses were performed on finger-prick blood samples from a population-based survey in 3 adjacent communities.
   Results. Among 5278 persons screened, 13 (0.2%) were positive by RDT and 123 (2.3%) by PCR. PCR-positive individuals were scattered over the study area, but logistic regression analysis suggested a propensity of these infections to cluster around RDT-positive individuals. The odds ratios for being PCR positive was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-19.9) for those living in the household of an RDT-positive individual and 1.64 (1.0-2.8; P = .06) for those living within <300 m, compared with >1000 m. Treating everyone within households of RDT-positive individuals (1% population) would target 13% of those who are PCR positive. Treating all living within a radius of <300 or <1000 m (14% or 58% population) would target 30% or 66% of infections, respectively. Among 4431 serologically screened individuals, 26% were seropositive. Treating everyone within seropositive households (63% population) would target 77% of PCR-positive individuals.
   Conclusions. Presumptive malaria treatment seemed justified within RDT-positive households and potentially worth considering within, for example, a radius of <300 m. Serology was not discriminative enough in identifying ongoing infections for improving focal interventions in this setting but may rather be useful to detect larger transmission foci.

TI Amplification of Mitochondrial DNA for detection of Plasmodiumvivax in
   Balochistan
SO JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Objective: To access a new step using PCR to amplify the targeted mtDNA sequence for detecting specifically Plasmodium vivax and its co-infections, false positive and false negative results with Plasmodium falciparum.
   Methods: In this study we have standardized a new technical approach in which the target mitochondrial DNA sequence (mtDNA) was amplified by using a PCR technique as a tool to detect Plasmodium spp. Species specific primers were designed to hybridize with cytochrome c oxidase gene of P. vivax (cox I) and P. falciparum (cox III). Two hundred blood samples were collected on the basis of clinical symptoms which were initially examined through microscopic analysis after preparing Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears. Afterwards genomic DNA was extracted from all samples and was then subjected to PCR amplification by using species specific primers and amplified segments were sequenced for confirmation of results.
   Results: One-hundred and thirty-two blood samples were detected as positive for malaria by PCR, out of which 64 were found to be positive by PCR and 53 by both microscopy and PCR for P. vivax infection. Nine samples were found to be false negative, one P. vivax mono infection was declared as co infection by PCR and 3 samples identified as having P. falciparum gametes were confirmed as P. vivax by PCR amplification. Sensitivity and specificity were found to be 85% and 92% respectively.
   Conclusion: Results obtained through PCR method were comparatively better and reliable than microscopy.

TI Improving the Specificity of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Diagnosis in
   High-Transmission Settings with a Two-Step Rapid Diagnostic Test and
   Microscopy Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Poor specificity may negatively impact rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-based diagnostic strategies for malaria. We performed real-time PCR on a subset of subjects who had undergone diagnostic testing with a multiple-antigen (histidine-rich protein 2 and pan-lactate dehydrogenase pLDH [ HRP2/pLDH]) RDT and microscopy. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT in comparison to results of PCR for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We developed and evaluated a two-step algorithm utilizing the multiple-antigen RDT to screen patients, followed by confirmatory microscopy for those individuals with HRP2-positive (HRP2(+))/pLDH-negative (pLDH(-)) results. In total, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from 276 individuals. There were 124 (44.9%) individuals with an HRP2(+)/pLDH(-) result, 94 (34.1%) with an HRP2(+)/pLDH(-) result, and 58 (21%) with a negative RDT result. The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT compared to results with real-time PCR were 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.9 to 100.0%) and 46.7% (95% CI, 37.7 to 55.9%), respectively. Of the 94 HRP2(+)/pLDH(-) results, only 32 (34.0%) and 35 (37.2%) were positive by microscopy and PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the two-step algorithm compared to results with real-time PCR were 95.5% (95% CI, 90.5 to 98.0%) and 91.0% (95% CI, 84.1 to 95.2), respectively. HRP2 antigen bands demonstrated poor specificity for the diagnosis of malaria compared to that of real-ime PCR in a high-transmission setting. The most likely explanation for this finding is the persistence of HRP2 antigenemia following treatment of an acute infection. The two-step diagnostic algorithm utilizing microscopy as a confirmatory test for indeterminate HRP2(+)/pLDH(-) results showed significantly improved specificity with little loss of sensitivity in a high-transmission setting.

TI Maternal Microchimerism Predicts Increased Infection but Decreased
   Disease due to Plasmodium falciparum During Early Childhood
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. A mother's infection with placental malaria (PM) can affect her child's susceptibility to malaria, although the mechanism remains unclear. The fetus acquires a small amount of maternal cells and DNA known as maternal microchimerism (MMc), and we hypothesized that PM increases MMc and that MMc alters risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria during infancy.
   Methods. In a nested cohort from Muheza, Tanzania, we evaluated the presence and level of cord blood MMc in offspring of women with and without PM. A maternal-specific polymorphism was identified for each maternal-infant pair, and MMc was assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The ability of MMc to predict malaria outcomes during early childhood was evaluated in longitudinal models.
   Results. Inflammatory PM increased the detection rate of MMc among offspring of primigravidae and secundigravidae, and both noninflammatory and inflammatory PM increased the level of MMc. Detectable MMc predicted increased risk of positive blood smear but, interestingly, decreased risk of symptomatic malaria and malaria hospitalization.
   Conclusions. The acquisition of MMc may result in increased malaria infection but protection from malaria disease. Future studies should be directed at the cellular component of MMc, with attention to its ability to directly or indirectly coordinate anti-malarial immune responses in the offspring.

TI In-Vivo Efficacy of Chloroquine to Clear Asymptomatic Infections in
   Mozambican Adults: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial with
   Implications for Elimination Strategies
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent reports regarding the re-emergence of parasite sensitivity to chloroquine call for a new consideration of this drug as an interesting complementary tool in malaria elimination efforts, given its good safety profile and long half-life. A randomized (2: 1), single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Manhic,a, Mozambique, to assess the in-vivo efficacy of chloroquine to clear plasmodium falciparum (Pf) asymptomatic infections. Primary study endpoint was the rate of adequate and parasitological response (ACPR) to therapy on day 28 (PCR-corrected). Day 0 isolates were analyzed to assess the presence of the PfCRT-76T CQ resistance marker. A total of 52 and 27 male adults were included in the CQ and Placebo group respectively. PCR-corrected ACPR was significantly higher in the CQ arm 89.4% (95%CI 80-98%) compared to the placebo (p < 0.001). CQ cleared 49/50 infections within the first 72 h while placebo cleared 12/26 (LRT p < 0.001). The PfCRT-76T mutation was present only in one out of 108 (0.9%) samples at baseline, well below the 84% prevalence found in 1999 in the same area. This study presents preliminary evidence of a return of chloroquine sensitivity in Mozambican Pf isolates, and calls for its further evaluation in community-based malaria elimination efforts, in combination with other effective anti-malarials.

TI Sequence variation in Plasmodium falciparum Histidine Rich Proteins 2
   and 3 in Indian isolates: Implications for Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test
   Performance
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Commercial malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect P. falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and cross react with PfHRP3, a structural homologue. Here, we analysed natural variations in PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 sequences from Indian isolates and correlated these variations with RDT reactivity. A total 1392 P. falciparum positive samples collected from eight endemic states were PCR amplified for Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes and were sequenced. The deduced protein sequences were analysed for repeat variations and correlated with RDT reactivity. Out of 1392 PCR amplified samples, a single sample was Pfhrp2 negative and two samples were Pfhrp3 negative. Complete Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 sequences were obtained for 769 samples and 750 samples, respectively. A total of 16 distinct repeat motifs were observed for Pfhrp2 and 11 for Pfhrp3, including some new repeat types. No correlation was found between variations in the size of Pfhrp2 repeat types 2 and 7, nor between any combinations of repeat motifs, and performance of a commercial RDT at low parasite densities. The findings suggest that sequence diversity in Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in Indian isolates is not likely to negatively influence performance of currently used PfHRP2 RDTs.

TI Evaluation of the utility value of three diagnostic methods in the
   detection of malaria parasites in endemic area
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is a debilitating disease with high morbidity and mortality in Africa, commonly caused by different species of the genus Plasmodium in humans. Misdiagnosis is a major challenge in endemic areas because of other disease complications and technical expertise of the medical laboratory staff. Microscopic method using Giemsa-stained blood film has been the mainstay of diagnosis of malaria. However, since 1993 when rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits were introduced, they have proved to be effective in the diagnosis of malaria. This study was aimed at comparing the accuracy of microscopy and RDTs in the diagnosis of malaria using nested PCR as the reference standard. Four hundred and twenty (420) venous blood specimens were collected from patients attending different General Hospitals in Ebonyi State with clinical symptoms of malaria. The samples were tested with Giemsa-stained microscopy and three RDTs. Fifty specimens were randomly selected for molecular analysis.
   Results: Using different diagnostic methods, the prevalence of malaria among the subjects studied was 25.95% as detected by microscopy, prevalence found among the RDTs was 22.90, 15.20 and 54.80% for Carestart, SD Bioline PF and SD Bioline PF/PV, respectively. Molecular assay yielded a prevalence of 32%. The major specie identified was Plasmodium falciparum; there was co-infection of P. falciparum with Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was 50.00 and 70.59% while that of the RDTs were (25.00 and 85.29%), (25.00 and 94.12%) and (68.75 and 52.94%) for Carestart, SD Bioline PF and SD Bioline PF/PV, respectively. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement of the methods with nested PCR. Microscopy showed a moderate measure of agreement (k = 0.491), Carestart showed a good measure of agreement (k = 0.611), SD Bioline PF showed a fair measure of agreement (k = 0.226) while SD Bioline PF/PV showed a poor measure of agreement (k = 0.172).
   Conclusions: This study recommends that the policy of malaria diagnosis be changed such that the routine diagnosis of malaria is done by a combination of both microscopy and a RDT kit of high sensitivity and specificity so as to complement the errors associated with either of the methods. The finding of P. ovale in the study area necessitates an expanded molecular epidemiology of malaria within the study area.

TI Indoor residual spraying with micro-encapsulated pirimiphos-methyl
   (Actellic (R) 300CS) against malaria vectors in the Lake Victoria basin,
   Tanzania
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   The indoor residual spraying programme for malaria vectors control was implemented in four districts of the Lake Victoria basin of Tanzania namely Ukerewe, Sengerema, Rorya andSerengeti. Entomological monitoring activities were implemented in one sentinel village in each district to evaluate the efficacy of pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS sprayed on different wall surfaces and its impact against malaria vectors post-IRS intervention.
   Methods
   The residual decay rate of p-methyl 300 CS applied at a target dosage of 1g a.i./m(2) on the-sprayed wall surfaces was monitored for a period of 43 weeks post-IRSusing the WHO cone wall bioassay method. The bioassays were performed by exposing 2-5 days old unfed susceptible female Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Kisumu strain) to sprayed wall surfaces for a period of 30 minutes. In each sentinel village, mosquito collection was carried out by trained community mosquito collectors. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from 6.00pm to 6.00am using CDC light traps and clay pot methods for indoors host seekingand outdoors resting mosquitoes respectively. Six traps (2 CDC light traps and 4 clay pots) were set per sentinel village per night for28 consecutive days in a moon. PCR and ELISA were used for mosquito species identification and sporozoite detection, respectively.
   Results
   Based on the WHOPES recommendation, insecticides should have a minimum efficacy of >= 80% mosquito mortality at 24 hours post exposure on the sprayed wall surfaces to be considered effective. In this study, p-methyl 300 CS was demonstrated to have a long residual efficacy of 21-43 weeks post-IRS on mud, cement, painted and wood wall surfaces. Number of anopheline mosquitoes decreased post-IRS interventions in all sentinel villages. The highest numbers ofanopheline mosquitoes were collected in November-December, 38-43 weeks post-IRS. A total of 270 female anopheline mosquitoes were analyzed by PCR; out of which 236 (87.4%) were An. gambiae s.l. and 34 (12.6%) were An. funestus group. Of the 236 An. gambiae s.l. identified 12.6% (n = 34) were An. gambiae s. s. and 68.6% (n = 162) were An. arabiensis. Ofthe 34 An. funestus group indentified 91.2% (n = 31) were An. parensis and 8.8% (n = 3) were An. rivulorum. The overall Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate was 0.7% (n = 2,098).
   Conclusions
   Pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS was found to be effective for IRS in the Lake Victoria basin, Tanzania. P-methyl 300 CShas a long residual efficacy on sprayed wall surfaces and therefore it is effective in controlling principal malaria vectors of An. gambiae s.l and An. funestus which rest on wall surfaces after and before feeding.

TI Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Pseudocercospora
   fijiensis to Determine the Role of PfHog1 in Osmotic Stress Regulation
   and Virulence Modulation
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Black Sigatoka disease, caused by Pseudocercospora fijiensis is a serious constraint to banana production worldwide. The disease continues to spread in new ecological niches and there is an urgent need to develop strategies for its control. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well known to respond to changes in external osmolarity. HOG pathway activation leads to phosphorylation, activation and nuclear transduction of the HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The activated HOG1 triggers several responses to osmotic stress, including up or down regulation of different genes, regulation of protein translation, adjustments to cell cycle progression and synthesis of osmolyte glycerol. This study investigated the role of the MAPK-encoding PfHog1 gene on osmotic stress adaptation and virulence of P. fijiensis. RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of PfHog1 significantly suppressed growth of P. fijiensis on potato dextrose agar media supplemented with 1 M NaCl, indicating that PfHog1 regulates osmotic stress. In addition, virulence of the PfHog1-silenced mutants of P. fijiensis on banana was significantly reduced, as observed from the low rates of necrosis and disease development on the infected leaves. Staining with lacto phenol cotton blue further confirmed the impaired mycelial growth of the PfHog1 in the infected leaf tissues, which was further confirmed with quantification of the fungal biomass using absolute-quantitative PCR. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PfHog1 plays a critical role in osmotic stress regulation and virulence of P. fijiensis on its host banana. Thus, PfHog1 could be an interesting target for the control of black Sigatoka disease in banana.

TI No serological evidence for Zika virus infection and low specificity for
   anti-Zika virus ELISA in malaria positive individuals among pregnant
   women from Madagascar in 2010
SO PLOS ONE
AB It was previously reported that a malaria infection may interfere with the specificity of a commercial ELISA test against Zika virus (ZIKV). We analyzed 1,216 plasma samples from healthy, pregnant women collected in two sites in Madagascar in 2010 for ZIKV antibodies using a commercial ELISA and for Plasmodium infection by PCR. This screen revealed six putative ZIKV-positive samples by ELISA. These results could not be confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays or virus neutralization tests. Four of these six samples were also positive for P. falciparum. We noted that the frequency of malaria positivity was higher in ZIKV-ELISA positive samples (50% and 100% in the two study sites) than ZIKV-negative samples (17% and 10%, respectively), suggesting that malaria may have led to false ZIKV-ELISA positives.

TI Artemisinin-based combination therapy in pregnant women in Zambia:
   efficacy, safety and risk of recurrent malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In Zambia, malaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, especially among under five children and pregnant women. For the latter, the World Health Organization recommends the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. In a context of limited information on ACT, the safety and efficacy of three combinations, namely artemether-lumefantrine (AL), mefloquine-artesunate (MQAS) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ) were assessed in pregnant women with malaria.
   Methods: The trial was carried out between July 2010 and August 2013 in Nchelenge district, Luapula Province, an area of high transmission, as part of a multi-centre trial. Women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and with malaria were recruited and randomized to one of the three study arms. Women were actively followed up for 63 days, and then at delivery and 1 year post-delivery.
   Results: Nine hundred pregnant women were included, 300 per arm. PCR-adjusted treatment failure was 4.7% (12/258) (95% CI 2.7-8.0) for AL, 1.3% (3/235) (95% CI 0.4-3.7) for MQAS and 0.8% (2/236) (95% CI 0.2-3.0) for DHAPQ, with significant risk difference between AL and DHAPQ (p = 0.01) and between AL and MQAS (p = 0.03) treatments. Re-infections during follow up were more frequent in the AL (HR: 4.71; 95% CI 3.10-7.2; p < 0.01) and MQAS (HR: 1.59; 95% CI 1.02-2.46; p = 0.04) arms compared to the DHAPQ arm. PCR-adjusted treatment failure was significantly associated with women under 20 years [Hazard Ratio (HR) 5.35 (95% CI 1.07-26.73; p = 0.04)] and higher malaria parasite density [3.23 (95% CI 1.03-10.10; p = 0.04)], and still women under 20 years [1.78, (95% CI 1.26-2.52; p < 0.01)] had a significantly higher risk of re-infection. The three treatments were generally well tolerated. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache and asthenia as adverse events (AEs) were more common in MQAS than in AL or DHAPQ (p < 0.001). Birth outcomes were not significantly different between treatment arms.
   Conclusion: As new infections can be prevented by a long acting partner drug to the artemisinins, DHAPQ should be preferred in places as Nchelenge district where transmission is intense while in areas of low transmission intensity AL or MQAS may be used.

TI Diagnosing congenital malaria in a high-transmission setting: clinical
   relevance and usefulness of P.falciparum HRP2-based testing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Congenital malaria diagnosis is challenging due to frequently observed low parasite density infections, while their clinical relevance during early infancy is not well characterized. In Nanoro health district (Burkina Faso), we determined the prevalence of congenital malaria by real-time quantitative PCR and we assessed the performance of rapid diagnosis test (RDT) and light microscopy (LM) to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections in cord-blood samples. In addition, we examined the usefulness of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein2 (PfHRP2) as surrogate biomarker of infection and explored association between congenital malaria and clinical outcomes. A prevalence of congenital malaria by qPCR of 4% (16/400) was found, which increased to 10% among newborns from mothers infected at delivery. RDT and LM showed poor performances indicating limited utility for congenital malaria screening in cord blood. Because PfHRP2 detection in cord blood could be affected by transplacental passage of parasite antigens, PfHRP2 might not be used as a surrogate biomarker of congenital malaria infections. There was no evidence of a significant clinical impact of congenital malaria on infant's health from birth to 59 days of life. Case control studies including long-term follow up may provide additional understanding on the relevance of neonatal malaria infections.

TI Interventions that effectively target Anopheles funestus mosquitoes
   could significantly improve control of persistent malaria transmission
   in south-eastern Tanzania
SO PLOS ONE
AB Malaria is transmitted by many Anopheles species whose proportionate contributions vary across settings. We re-assessed the roles of Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus, and examined potential benefits of species-specific interventions in an area in southeastern Tanzania, where malaria transmission persists, four years after mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Monthly mosquito sampling was done in randomly selected households in three villages using CDC light traps and back-pack aspirators, between January-2015 and January-2016, four years after the last mass distribution of LLINs in 2011. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify members of An. funestus and Anopheles gambiae complexes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect Plasmodium sporozoites in mosquito salivary glands, and to identify sources of mosquito blood meals. WHO susceptibility assays were done on wild caught female An. funestus s.l, and physiological ages approximated by examining mosquito ovaries for parity. A total of 20,135 An. arabiensis and 4,759 An. funestus were collected. The An. funestus group consisted of 76.6% An. funestus s.s, 2.9% An. rivulorum, 7.1% An. leesoni, and 13.4% unamplified samples. Of all mosquitoes positive for Plasmodium, 82.6% were An. funestus s.s, 14.0% were An. arabiensis and 3.4% were An. rivulorum. An. funestus and An. arabiensis contributed 86.21% and 13.79% respectively, of annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR). An. arabiensis fed on humans (73.4%), cattle (22.0%), dogs (3.1%) and chicken (1.5%), but An. funestus fed exclusively on humans. The An. funestus populations were 100% susceptible to organophosphates, pirimiphos methyl and malathion, but resistant to permethrin (10.5% mortality), deltamethrin (18.7%), lambda-cyhalothrin (18.7%) and DDT (26.2%), and had reduced susceptibility to bendiocarb (95%) and propoxur (90.1%). Parity rate was higher in An. funestus (65.8%) than An. arabiensis (44.1%). Though An. arabiensis is still the most abundant vector species here, the remaining malaria transmission is predominantly mediated by An. funestus, possibly due to high insecticide resistance and high survival probabilities. Interventions that effectively target An. funestus mosquitoes could therefore significantly improve control of persistent malaria transmission in south-eastern Tanzania.

TI Genetic polymorphism of Merozoite Surface Protein-2 (MSP-2) in
   Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Pawe District, North West Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   In malaria endemic regions, Plasmodium falciparum infection is characterized by extensive genetic diversity. Describing this diversity provides important information about the local malaria situation. This study was conducted to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity of P. falciparum in Pawe district, North West Ethiopia, using the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2 gene.
   Methods
   Atotal of 92 isolates from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum attending Pawe Health Centre were collected from September to December 2013. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex method and analyzed by length polymorphism following gel electrophoresis of DNA products from nested PCR of msp2 (block 3), targeting allelic families of FC27 and 3D7/IC.
   Results
   There were twenty-two different msp2 alleles, 11 corresponding to the 3D7/IC and 11 to the FC27 allelic family. The frequency of isolates of the msp2 3D7/IC allelic family was higher (51%) compared to FC27 (49%). The majority of the isolates (76%) contained multiple infections and the overall mean multiplicity of infection was 2.8 (CI 95% 2.55-3.03). The heterozygosity index was 0.66 for msp2. There was no statically significant difference in the multiplicity of infection by age or parasite density.
   Conclusions
   The results of this study show that P. falciparum polymorphismsare extensive in Northwest Ethiopia and most of the infections are composed of multiple clones.

TI Multiplex, DNase-free one-step reverse transcription PCR for Plasmodium
   18S rRNA and spliced gametocyte-specific mRNAs
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium gametocytes are sexual stages transmitted to female Anopheles mosquitoes. While Plasmodium parasites can be differentiated microscopically on Giemsa-stained blood smears, molecular methods are increasingly used because of their increased sensitivity. Molecular detection of gametocytes requires methods that discriminate between asexual and sexual stage parasites. Commonly tested gametocyte-specific mRNAs are pfs25 and pfs230 detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, detection of these unspliced mRNA targets requires preceding DNase treatment of nucleic acids to eliminate co-purified genomic DNA. If gametocyte-specific, spliced mRNAs could be identified, DNase treatment could be eliminated and one-step multiplexed molecular methods utilized.
   Results: Expression data was used to identify highly-expressed mRNAs in mature gametocytes that were also low in antisense RNA expression in non-gametocyte stages. After testing numerous candidate mRNAs, the spliced female Pf3D7_0630000 mRNA was selected as a Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte-specific biomarker compatible with Plasmodium 18S rRNA RT-PCR. This mRNA was only detected in samples containing mature gametocytes and was absent in those containing only asexual stage parasites or uninfected human blood. PF3D7_0630000 RT-PCR detected gametocytes across a wide range of parasite densities in both spiked and clinical samples and agreed with pfs25 RTPCR, the gold standard for RT-PCR-based gametocyte detection. PF3D7_0630000 multiplexed with Plasmodium 18S rRNA RT-PCR was more sensitive than other spliced mRNA targets for one-step RT-PCR gametocyte detection.
   Conclusions: Because the spliced target does not require DNase treatment, the PF3D7_0630000 assay can be multiplexed with Plasmodium 18S rRNA for direct one-step detection of gametocytes from whole human blood.

TI Molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance in Central, West and
   East African children with severe malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1), P. falciparum Ca2+-ATPase (PfATP6) and Kelch-13 propeller domain (PfK13) loci are molecular markers of parasite susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs. Their frequency distributions were determined in the isolates collected from children with severe malaria originating from three African countries.
   Methods: Samples from 287 children with severe malaria [(Gabon: n = 114); (Ghana: n = 89); (Kenya: n = 84)] were genotyped for pfmdr1, pfatp6 and pfk13 loci by DNA sequencing and assessing pfmdr1 copy number variation (CNV) by real-time PCR.
   Results: Pfmdr1-N86Y mutation was detected in 48, 10 and 10% in Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. At codon 184, the prevalence of the mutation was 73% in Lambarene, 63% in Kumasi and 49% Kisumu. The S1034C and N1042D variants were absent at all three sites, while the frequency of the D1246Y mutation was 1, 3 and 13% in Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. Isolates with two pfmdr1 gene copy number predominantly harboured the N86Y wild-type allele and were mostly found in Kumasi (10%) (P < 0.0001). Among the main pfmdr1 haplotypes (NFD, NYD and YFD), NYD was associated with highest parasitaemia (P = 0.04). At the pfatp6 locus, H243Y and A623E mutations were observed at very low frequency at all three sites. The prevalence of the pfatp6 E431K variant was 6, 18 and 17% in Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. The L263E and S769N mutations were absent in all isolates. The pfk13 variants associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia were not observed. Eleven novel substitutions in the pfk13 locus occurring at low frequency were observed.
   Conclusions: Artemisinins are still highly efficacious in large malaria-endemic regions though declining efficacy has occurred in Southeast Asia. The return of chloroquine-sensitive strains following the removal of drug pressure is observed. However, selection of wild-type alleles in the multidrug-resistance gene and the increased gene copy number is associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity. This study indicates a need to constantly monitor drug resistance to artemisinin in field isolates from malaria-endemic countries.

TI High throughput resistance profiling of Plasmodium falciparum infections
   based on custom dual indexing and Illumina next generation
   sequencing-technology
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum can be used to indicate the parasite's susceptibility to antimalarial drugs as well as its geographical origin. Both of these factors are key to monitoring development and spread of antimalarial drug resistance. In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP-profiling of 457 malaria infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance-conferring SNPs occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the various SNP-positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8-100% of samples. The SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance-conferring SNPs in pfK13 are absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes more affordable than ever before.

TI Malaria prevalence in asymptomatic and symptomatic children in Kiwangwa,
   Bagamoyo district, Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria prevalence continues to decline across sub-Saharan Africa as a result of various intervention strategies. However, the diseases still poses a public health concern in the region. While symptomatic malaria is recognized and treated, asymptomatic infections become increasingly important for interrupting transmission. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess malaria prevalence in symptomatic and asymptomatic children in Kiwangwa ward in Bagamoyo District in Tanzania.
   Methods: Four hundred school-aged children in Kiwanga ward were recruited in the study; 200 from Kiwangwa dispensary and 200 from nearby schools. Primary health parameters were examined and blood samples collected and examined for Plasmodium falciparum prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT), light microscopy (LM) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting transcripts of A-type 18s rRNA of P. falciparum. Gametocytes were detected by LM and RT-qPCR targeting transcripts of gametocyte specific marker, Pfs25.
   Results: Overall P. falciparum prevalence was 73.3, 40.8 and 36.3% by RT-qPCR, RDT and LM in the study area, respectively (P < 0.001). As expected symptomatic children had a significantly higher prevalence of 89, 67.5 and 64.5% by qPCR, RDT and LM, compared to 57.5, 14 and 8% in the asymptomatic group, respectively. However, gametocyte prevalence in asymptomatic individuals was higher by both LM (2%) and qPCR (14%) than in symptomatic individuals LM (0.5%) and qPCR (3%).
   Conclusions: A substantial difference in prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections observed in Kiwangwa ward underpins the use of molecular tools in malaria surveillance aiming at estimating prevalence and transmission. Notably, the higher gametocytaemia observed in asymptomatic children indicates the reservoir infections and points to the need for detection and treatment of both asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria.

TI Malaria Surveillance - United States, 2014
SO MMWR SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES
AB Problem/Condition: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for travelers.
   Period Covered: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of illness in 2014 and trends during previous years.
   Description of System: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are reported to local and state health departments by health care providers or laboratory staff Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, or direct CDC consultations. CDC conducts antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health departments. Data from these reporting systems serve as the basis for this report.
   Results: CDC received reports of 1,724 confirmed malaria cases, including one congenital case and two cryptic cases, with onset of symptoms in 2014 among persons in the United States. The number of confirmed cases in 2014 is consistent with the number of confirmed cases reported in 2013 (n = 1,741; this number has been updated from a previous publication to account for delayed reporting for persons with symptom onset occurring in late 2013). Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae were identified in 66.1%, 13.3%, 5.2%, and 2.7% of cases, respectively. Less than 1.0% of patients were infected with two species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 11.7% of cases. CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 14.2% of confirmed cases and tested 12.0% of P. falciparum specimens for antimalarial resistance markers. Of patients who reported purpose of travel, 57.5% were visiting friends and relatives (VFR). Among U.S. residents for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region was known, 7.8% reported that they initiated and adhered to a chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to which they had traveled. Thirty-two cases were among pregnant women, none of whom had adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported cases, 17.0% were classified as severe illness, and five persons with malaria died. CDC received 137 P. falciparum-positive samples for the detection of antimalarial resistance markers (although some loci for chloroquine and mefloquine were untestable for up to nine samples). Of the 137 samples tested, 131 (95.6%) had genetic polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 96 (70.0%) with sulfadoxine resistance, 77 (57.5%) with chloroquine resistance, three (2.3%) with mefloquine drug resistance, one (<1.0%) with atovaquone resistance, and two (1.4%) with artemisinin resistance.
   Interpretation: The overall trend of malaria cases has been increasing since 1973; the number of cases reported in 2014 is the fourth highest annual total since then. Despite progress in reducing global prevalence of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many regions and use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate.
   Public Health Action: Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased slightly in 2014 compared with 2013, but still remains unacceptably low. In 2014, at least one essential element (i.e., species, travel history, or resident status) was missing in 21.3% of case report forms. Incomplete reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and prevent infections. VFR travelers continue to be a difficult population to reach with effective malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies that effectively target VFR travelers need to be developed and implemented to have a substantial impact on the number of imported malaria cases in the United States. Fewer U.S. resident patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis in 2014 (27.2%) compared with 2013 (28.6%), and adherence was poor among those who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will prevent the majority of malaria illnesses and reduce risk for severe disease (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent molecular laboratory advances have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (https://www. cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) and improve the ability of CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both domestically and globally. For this effort to be successful, specimens should be submitted for all cases diagnosed in the United States. Clinicians should consult CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC Malaria Hotline for case management advice, when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained online at https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/ or by calling the Malaria Hotline at 770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713.

TI Fast and robust single PCR for Plasmodium sporozoite detection in
   mosquitoes using the cytochrome oxidase I gene
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Molecular tools for detecting malaria-infected mosquitoes with improved practicality, sensitivity and specificity, and high-throughput are required. A common PCR technique used to detect mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium spp. is a nested PCR assay based on the 18s-rRNA gene. However, this technique has several technical limitations, is laborious and time consuming.
   Methods: In this study, a PCR-based on the Plasmodium cytochrome oxidase I (COX-I) gene was compared with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR using serial dilutions (330-0.0012 pg) of DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi and with DNA from 48 positive and negative Kenyan mosquitoes (previously detected by using both ELISA and PCR). This assay for Plasmodium spp. DNA detection using the fast COX-I PCR assay was then performed individually on 2122 field collected mosquitoes (from the Solomon Islands) in which DNA was extracted from head and thorax.
   Results: The fast COX-I PCR assay took 1 h to run and consistently detected as low as to 0.043 pg of parasite DNA (equivalent to two parasites) in a single PCR, while analyses with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR required 4 h to complete with a consistent detection threshold of 1.5 pg of DNA. Both assays produced concordant results when applied to the 48 Kenyan control samples with known Plasmodium spp. infection status. The fast COX-I PCR identified 23/2122 Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes from the Solomon Islands.
   Conclusions: This new COX-I PCR adapted for a single PCR reaction is a faster, simpler, cheaper, more sensitive technique amenable to high-throughput analyses for Plasmodium DNA detection in mosquitoes and is comparable to the 18s-rRNA nested PCR. The improved sensitivity seen with the fast COX-I PCR will improve the accuracy of mosquito infection rate determination.

TI Immunolocation and enzyme activity analysis of Cryptosporidium parvum
   enolase
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Enolase is an essential multifunctional glycolytic enzyme that is involved in many biological processes of apicomplexan protozoa, such as adhesion and invasion. However, the characteristics of enolase in Cryptosporidium parvum, including the location on the oocyst and the enzyme activity, remain unclear.
   Methods: The C. parvum enolase gene (cpeno) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was analysed by bioinformatics software. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified recombinant protein was used for enzyme activity analysis, binding experiments and antibody preparation. The localisation of enolase on oocysts was examined via immunofluorescence techniques.
   Results: A 1,350 bp DNA sequence was amplified from cDNA taken from C. parvum oocysts. The deduced amino acids sequence of C. parvum enolase (CpEno) had 82.1% homology with Cryptosporidium muris enolase, and 54. 7-68.0% homology with others selected species. Western blot analysis indicated that recombinant C. parvum enolase (rCpEno) could be recognised by C. parvum-infected cattle sera. Immunolocalization testing showed that CpEno was found to locate mainly on the surface of oocysts. The enzyme activity was 33.5 U/mg, and the Michaelis constant (Km) was 0.571 mM/l. Kinetic measurements revealed that the most suitable pH value was 7.0-7.5, and there were only minor effects on the activity of rCpEno with a change in the reaction temperature. The enzyme activity decreased when the Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ and Na+ concentrations of the reaction solution increased. The binding assays demonstrated that rCpEno could bind to human plasminogen.
   Conclusion: This study is the first report of immunolocation, binding activity and enzyme characteristics of CpEno. The results of this study suggest that the surface-associated CpEno not only functions as a glycolytic enzyme but may also participate in attachment and invasion process of the parasite.

TI Increased susceptibility of blood type O individuals to develop anemia
   in Plasmodium vivax infection
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Plasmodium vivax has been reported to cause severe malaria, and one of the main resulting complications is anemia. Considering that P. vivax infects only young erythrocytes, anemia has been associated with the destruction of infected and non-infected erythrocytes. However, few studies have focused on understanding the relationship between the pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria and human genetic polymorphisms. Although ABO groups seem to influence the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the association between P. vivax and ABO blood groups has been minimally investigated. Thus, we investigate the correlation between ABO blood groups and anemia induced by P. vivax infection. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms at the ABO gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and Real-Time PCR in P. vivax-infected subjects. The ABO blood types were associated with the hematological data of the patients. Our main finding was that type O infected-individuals showed lower levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to type A-infected individuals. The correlation between ABO blood groups and hemoglobin levels remained significant when a multiple linear regression was applied with the possible confounding effects of clinical-epidemiologic variables taken into account. The finding that type O individuals have a higher frequency of anemia is a first step to understand the mechanisms involved in malaria anemia, which could be associated to increased destruction of type O erythrocytes.

TI Integrated Magnetic Bead Quantum Dot Immunoassay for Malaria Detection
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Malaria persists as a disease of high morbidity and mortality due to improper diagnosis, overuse of drugs, rapidly evolving drug resistant parasites, and poor disease monitoring. The two common tests used in developing countries, microscopic examination of Glemsa slides and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), have limitations associated with variability in specificity and sensitivity, and qualitative outcome. Here we report on an immunoassay using magnetic beads for capture and quantum dots for detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2). Conventional immunoassays, such as ELISA, and molecular analysis tools, such as PCR, are difficult to implement in low resource settings. Therefore, to provide a proof-of principle of translation of this assay to low resource settings, we demonstrate HRP2 detection in an automated droplet-based microfluidic device. Droplet-based platforms have the potential to allow translation of molecular detection assays to point-of-care use in low resource settings.

TI Variable number of tandem repeats of 9 Plasmodium vivax genes among
   Southeast Asian isolates
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) provides valuable information about both the functional and evolutionary aspects of genetic diversity. Comparative analysis of 3 Plasmodium falciparum genomes has shown that more than 9% of its open reading frames (ORFs) harbor VNTRs. Although microsatellites and VNTR genes of P. vivax were reported, the VNTR polymorphism of genes has not been examined widely. In this study, 230 P. vivax genes were analyzed for VNTRs by SERV, and 33 kinds of TR deletions or insertions from 29P. vivax genes (12.6%) were found. Of these, 9 VNTR fragments from 8 P. vivax genes were used for PCR amplification and sequence analysis to examine the genetic diversity among 134 isolates from four Southeast Asian countries (China, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar) with different malaria endemicity. We confirmed the existence of extensive polymorphism of VNTR fragments in field isolates. This detection provides several suitable markers for analysis of the molecular epidemiology of P. vivax field isolates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Antibodies elicited during natural infection in a predominantly
   Plasmodium falciparum transmission area cross-react with sexual
   stage-specific antigen in P-vivax
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Infections caused by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax account for more than 90% of global malaria burden. Exposure to malaria parasite elicits immune responses during natural infection and it is generally believed that the immunity is not only stage specific but also species specific. However, partial genomic similarity for various antigens in different Plasmodium spp. raises the possibility of immunological cross-reactivity at the level of specific antigens. Serum samples collected from children who were permanent residents of a P. falciparum transmission area in Zimbabwe were screened for antibody reactivity against Pfs48/45, a P. falciparum gametocyte antigen and Pvs48/45, a P. vivax homolog of Pfs48/45 using ELISA. Western blotting was used to further confirm identity of the specific antibody reactivity to the Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45 proteins. Pan Plasmodium PCR and nested PCR were used to confirm infection with the Plasmodium species. Twenty-seven percent (49/181) of the participants were found to be sero-positive for Pfs48/45 and 73% (n = 36) of these Pfs48/45 positive sera also showed reactivity with Pvs48/45. Immune cross-reactivity revealed by ELISA was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a panel of randomly selected 23 Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45 ELISA positive samples. Nested PCR analysis of 27 blood samples randomly selected from the 36 that showed positive ELISA reactivity to both Pfs48/45 and Pvs48/45 antigens confirmed infection with P. falciparum and generalized absence of P. vivax except for a single sample which revealed PCR positivity for both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Our studies with sera samples from a predominantly P. falciparum transmission area in Zimbabwe suggest immunological cross-reactivity with Pvs48/45, thus raising the possibility of partial species cross-reactive immunity and possible cross-boosting of immunity during co-infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax.

TI Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of the novel
   long-acting antimalarial DSM265: a two-part first-in-human phase 1a/1b
   randomised study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background DSM265 is a novel antimalarial that inhibits plasmodial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of DSM265, and tested its antimalarial activity.
   Methods Healthy participants aged 18-55 years were enrolled in a two-part study: part 1, a single ascending dose (25-1200 mg), double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, and part 2, an open-label, randomised, active-comparator controlled study, in which participants were inoculated with Plasmodium falciparum induced bloodstage malaria (IBSM) and treated with DSM265 (150 mg) or mefloquine (10 mg/kg). Primary endpoints were DSM265 safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Randomisation lists were created using a validated, automated system. Both parts were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12613000522718 (part 1) and number ACTRN12613000527763 (part 2).
   Findings In part 1, 73 participants were enrolled between April 12, 2013, and July 14, 2015 (DSM265, n= 55; placebo, n= 18). In part 2, nine participants were enrolled between Sept 30 and Nov 25, 2013 (150 mg DSM265, n= 7; 10 mg/kg mefloquine, n= 2). In part 1, 117 adverse events were reported; no drug-related serious or severe events were reported. The most common drug-related adverse event was headache. The mean DSM265 peak plasma concentration (C-max) ranged between 1310 ng/mL and 34 800 ng/mL and was reached in a median time (t(max)) between 1.5 h and 4 h, with a mean elimination half-life between 86 h and 118 h. In part 2, the log(10) parasite reduction ratio at 48 h in the DSM265 (150 mg) group was 1.55 (95% CI 1.42-1.67) and in the mefloquine (10 mg/kg) group was 2.34 (2.17-2.52), corresponding to a parasite clearance half-life of 9.4 h (8.7-10.2) and 6.2 h (5.7-6.7), respectively. The median minimum inhibitory concentration of DSM265 in blood was estimated as 1040 ng/mL (range 552-1500), resulting in a predicted single efficacious dose of 340 mg. Parasite clearance was significantly faster in participants who received mefloquine than in participants who received DSM265 (p< 0.0001).
   Interpretation The good safety profile, long elimination half-life, and antimalarial effect of DSM265 supports its development as a partner drug in a single-dose antimalarial combination treatment.

TI The effectiveness of riboflavin and ultraviolet light pathogen reduction
   technology in eliminating Trypanosoma cruzi from leukoreduced whole
   blood
SO TRANSFUSION
AB BACKGROUNDThe parasitic Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is mainly transmitted by insect vectors. Other infection routes, both in endemic and in nonendemic areas, include organ and marrow transplantation, congenital transmission, and blood transfusion. Asymptomatic chronic chagasic individuals may have a low and transient parasitemia in peripheral blood and, consequently, they can unknowingly transmit the disease via blood transfusion. Riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light pathogen reduction is a method to reduce pathogen transfusion transmission risk based on damage to the pathogen nucleic acids.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSIn this study, we tested the effectiveness of this technology for the elimination of T. cruzi parasites in artificially contaminated whole blood units (WBUs) and thus for decreasing the risk of T. cruzi transfusion transmission. The contaminated WBUs were leukoreduced by filtration and treated with riboflavin and UV light. The level of pathogen reduction was quantified by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as a viability assay.
   RESULTSThe RNA (cDNA) quantification of the parasites showed a more than 99% reduction of viable T. cruzi parasites after leukoreduction and a complete reduction (100%) after the riboflavin and UV light treatment.
   CONCLUSIONRiboflavin and UV light treatment and leukoreduction used in conjunction appears to eliminate significant amounts of viable T. cruzi in whole blood. Both strategies could complement other blood bank measures already implemented to prevent the transmission of T. cruzi via blood transfusion.

TI Functional and structural characterization of the pentapeptide insertion
   of Theileria annulata lactate dehydrogenase by site-directed
   mutagenesis, comparative modeling and molecular dynamics simulations
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS & MODELLING
AB Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important metabolic enzyme in glycolysis and it has been considered as the main energy source in many organisms including apicomplexan parasites. Differences at the active site loop of the host and parasite LDH's makes this enzyme an attractive target for drug inhibitors. In this study, five amino acid insertions in the active site pocket of Theileria annulata LDH (TaLDH) were deleted by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, expression and activity analysis of mutant and wild type TaLDH enzymes were performed. Removal of the insertion at the active site loop caused production of an inactive enzyme. Furthermore, structures of wild and mutant enzymes were predicted by comparative modeling and the importance of the insertions at the active site loop were also assigned by molecular docking and dynamics simulations in order to evaluate essential role of this loop for the enzymatic activity. Pentapeptide insertion removal resulted in loss of LDH activity due to deletion of Trp96 and conformational change of Arg98 because of loop instability. Analysis of wild type and mutant enzymes with comparative molecular dynamics simulations showed that the fluctuations of the loop residues increase in mutant enzyme. Together with in silico studies, in vitro results revealed that active site loop has a vital role in the enzyme activity and our findings promise hope for the further drug design studies against theileriosis and other apicomplexan parasite diseases.

TI Vector bionomics and malaria transmission along the Thailand-Myanmar
   border: a baseline entomological survey
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB Baseline entomological surveys were conducted in four sentinel sites along the Thailand-Myanmar border to address vector bionomics and malaria transmission in the context of a study on malaria elimination. Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using human-landing catch and cow-bait collection in four villages during the rainy season from May-June, 2013. Mosquitoes were identified to species level by morphological characters and by AS-PCR. Sporozoite indexes were determined on head/thoraces of primary and secondary malaria vectors using real-time PCR. A total of 4,301 anopheles belonging to 12 anopheline taxa were identified. Anopheles minimus represented >98% of the Minimus Complex members (n=1,683), whereas the An. maculatus group was composed of two dominant species, An. sawadwongporni and An. maculatus. Overall, 25 Plasmodium-positive mosquitoes (of 2,323) were found, representing a sporozoite index of 1.1% [95%CI 0.66-1.50]. The transmission intensity as measured by the EIR strongly varied according to the village (ANOVA, F=17.67, df= 3, P<0.0001). Our findings highlight the diversity and complexity of the biting pattern of malaria vectors along the Thailand-Myanmar border that represent a formidable challenge for malaria control and elimination.

TI Burden and impact of Plasmodium vivax in pregnancy: A multi-centre
   prospective observational study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Despite that over 90 million pregnancies are at risk of Plasmodium vivax infection annually, little is known about the epidemiology and impact of the infection in pregnancy.
   Methodology and principal findings
   We undertook a health facility-based prospective observational study in pregnant women from Guatemala (GT), Colombia (CO), Brazil (BR), India (IN) and Papua New Guinea PNG). Malaria and anemia were determined during pregnancy and fetal outcomes assessed at delivery. A total of 9388 women were enrolled at antennal care (ANC), of whom 53% (4957) were followed until delivery. Prevalence of P. vivax monoinfection in maternal blood at delivery was 0.4% (20/4461) by microscopy [GT 0.1%, CO 0.5%, BR 0.1%, IN 0.2%, PNG 1.2%] and 7% (104/1488) by PCR. P. falciparum monoinfection was found in 0.5% (22/4463) of women by microscopy [GT 0%, CO 0.5%, BR 0%, IN 0%, PNG 2%]. P. vivax infection was observed in 0.4% (14/3725) of placentas examined by microscopy and in 3.7% (19/508) by PCR. P. vivax in newborn blood was detected in 0.02% (1/4302) of samples examined by microscopy [in cord blood; 0.05% (2/4040) by microscopy, and 2.6% (13/497) by PCR]. Clinical P. vivax infection was associated with increased risk of maternal anemia (Odds Ratio-OR, 5.48, [95% CI 1.83-16.41]; p = 0.009), while submicroscopic vivax infection was not associated with increased risk of moderate-severe anemia (Hb<8g/dL) (OR, 1.16, [95% CI 0.52-2.59]; p = 0.717), or low birth weight (<2500g) (OR, 0.52, [95% CI, 0.23-1.16]; p = 0.110).
   Conclusions
   In this multicenter study, the prevalence of P. vivax infection in pregnancy by microscopy was overall low across all endemic study sites; however, molecular methods revealed a significant number of submicroscopic infections. Clinical vivax infection in pregnancy was associated with maternal anemia, which may be deleterious for infant's health. These results may help to guide maternal health programs in settings where vivax malaria is endemic; they also highlight the need of addressing a vulnerable population such as pregnant women while embracing malaria elimination in endemic countries.

TI Microscopic detection of hemozoin in peripheral leukocytes fails to
   indicate plasmodial placental infection in pregnant women
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB Introduction: Malaria in pregnancy very often includes gestational (parasites in maternal peripheral blood) and placental (parasites in placental blood) infection, but the later condition can only be detected after delivery. High frequency of placental plasmodial infection has been confirmed in many countries and is associated with negative birth outcomes. With the hypothesis that placental infection is accompanied by hemozoin circulation in maternal peripheral blood, an exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the association between peripheral leukocytes with hemozoin and placental infection by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium falciparum in parturient women.
   Methodology: A descriptive, transversal and exploratory (pilot type) study was carried out with women from two malaria-endemic localities of northwest Colombia. A total of 25 parturient women with confirmed placental infection and 25 without placental infection were included. Two independent readers measured the number of leukocytes with hemozoin in thick smears of maternal peripheral blood. Plasmodial infection in maternal peripheral blood and placental blood was detected by thick smear and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
   Results: Four parturient women had leukocytes with hemozoin in peripheral blood; three of them had placental plasmodial infection and one was negative for placental infection. No statistically significant association between leukocytes with hemozoin in peripheral blood and placental infection was observed.
   Conclusions: With this limited sample size, detection of leukocytes with hemozoin by thick smear of maternal peripheral blood did not indicate presence of placental infection.

TI Malaria and Chikungunya Detected Using Molecular Diagnostics Among
   Febrile Kenyan Children
SO OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is frequently overdiagnosed as the cause of an undifferentiated febrile illness, whereas arboviral illnesses are presumed to be underdiagnosed.
   Methods. Sera from 385 febrile Kenyan children, who presented to 1 of 4 clinical sites, were tested using microscopy and realtime molecular assays for dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), malaria, and Leptospira.
   Results. Malaria was the primary clinical diagnosis for 254 patients, and an arboviral infection (DENV or CHIKV) was the primary diagnosis for 93 patients. In total, 158 patients (41.0%) had malaria and 32 patients (8.3%) had CHIKV infections. Compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction, microscopy demonstrated a percent positive agreement of 49.7%. The percentage of malaria cases detected by microscopy varied significantly between clinical sites. Arboviral infections were the clinical diagnosis for patients on the Indian Ocean coast (91 of 238, 38.2%) significantly more often than patients in the Lake Victoria region (2 of 145, 1.4%; P < .001). However, detection of CHIKV infections was significantly higher in the Lake Victoria region (19 of 145 [13.1%] vs 13 of 239 [5.4%]; P = .012).
   Conclusions. The clinical diagnosis of patients with an acute febrile illness, even when aided by microscopy, remains inaccurate in malaria-endemic areas, contributing to inappropriate management decisions.

TI Plasmodium falciparum genotypes in matched peripheral, placental and
   umbilical cord blood in an area characterised by unstable malaria
   transmission in eastern Sudan
SO HELIYON
AB Background: There are few published studies on Plasmodium falciparum genotypes in peripheral, placental and umbilical cord blood in areas characterised by unstable malaria transmission.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate P. falciparum genotypes in matched peripheral, placental and umbilical cord blood in eastern Sudan. Thick blood smears and P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and 2 (MSP2) genes as polymorphic markers in polymerase chain reactions were investigated in 3 kinds of samples of 153 pregnant women at delivery.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of blood film-detected P. falciparum in which 5 (3.3%), 7 (4.6%) and 3 (2.0%) (P = 0.437) of the 153 samples were determined to be P. falciparum-positive by microscopy for maternal peripheral, placental and cord blood samples, respectively.
   Out of these 145 samples, 24 (16.6%), 39 (26.9%) and 24 (16.6%) (P = 0.039) of the peripheral, placental and cord samples, respectively, had submicroscopic parasitaemia (blood films were negative). There was no association between submicroscopic parasitaemia and age or parity.
   RO33 and K1 (MSP1 alleles) were detected in 21/29 (72.4%), 42/46 (85.7%), 26/27 (92.2%) and 6/29 (20.6), 16/46 (32.6) and 0(0) (P < 0.001) of the maternal, placental and cord samples, respectively. MAD20 was not detected in any of the samples. While the 3D7/IC1 allele was detected in 12 (41.3%), 30 (65.2%) and 4 (14.8%) (P < 0.001) of the peripheral, placental and cord samples, respectively, the FC (MSP2) allele was detected in only the 6 (20.6) placental samples. Multi-clonal infection was detected in 10 (34.4), 27 (58.6) and 3 (11.1) (P < 0.001) of the maternal placental and cord samples, respectively.
   Conclusion: Compared with the peripheral and cord samples, placental samples had a higher prevalence of submicroscopic parasitaemia. MSP1 alleles were predominant in the cord, while MSP2 alleles were predominant in the placental samples, which had a significant higher multiplicity of the infection.

TI Aetiology and Outcomes of Suspected Infections of the Central Nervous
   System in Children in Mbarara, Uganda
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are severe conditions, leading to neurological sequelae or death. Knowledge of the causative agents is essential to develop guidelines for case management in resource-limited settings. Between August 2009 and October 2012, we conducted a prospective descriptive study of the aetiology of suspected CNS infections in children two months to 12 years old, with fever and at least one sign of CNS involvement in Mbarara Hospital, Uganda. Children were clinically evaluated on admission and discharge, and followed-up for 6 months for neurological sequelae. Pathogens were identified from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood using microbiological and molecular methods. We enrolled 459 children. Plasmodium falciparum (36.2%) and bacteria in CSF (13.3%) or blood (3.3%) were the most detected pathogens. Viruses were found in 27 (5.9%) children. No pathogen was isolated in 207 (45.1%) children. Patterns varied by age and HIV status. Eighty- three (18.1%) children died during hospitalisation, and 23 (5.0%) during follow-up. Forty-one (13.5%) children had neurological sequelae at the last visit. While malaria remains the main aetiology in children with suspected CNS infections, no pathogen was isolated in many children. The high mortality and high rate of neurological sequelae highlight the need for efficient diagnosis.

TI Single dose primaquine to reduce gametocyte carriage and Plasmodium
   falciparum transmission in Cambodia: An open-label randomized trial
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ, 0.25mg/kg) is recommended in combination with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a gametocytocide to prevent Plasmodium falciparum transmission in areas threatened by artemisinin resistance. To date, no randomized controlled trials have measured primaquine's effect on infectiousness to Anopheline mosquitoes in Southeast Asia.
   Methods
   Cambodian adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive a single 45mg dose of primaquine (equivalent to three SLD PQ) or no primaquine after the third dose of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DHP) therapy. A membrane-feeding assay measured infectiousness to Anopheles dirus on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of blood-stage therapy. Gametocytemia was evaluated by microscopy and reverse-transcriptase PCR.
   Results
   Prior to trial halt for poor DHP treatment efficacy, 101 participants were randomized and 50 received primaquine. Overall microscopic gametocyte prevalence was low (9%), but gametocytemic subjects given primaquine were gametocyte-free by day 14, and significantly less likely to harbor gametocytes by day 7 compared to those treated with DHP-alone, who remained gametocytemic for a median of two weeks. Only one infectious subject was randomized to the primaquine group, precluding assessment of transmission-blocking efficacy. However, he showed a two-fold reduction in oocyst density of infected mosquitoes less than 24 hours after primaquine dosing. In the DHP-alone group, four subjects remained infectious through day 14, infecting roughly the same number of mosquitoes pre and post-treatment. Overall, microscopic gametocytemia was an excellent predictor of infectiousness, and performed better than submicroscopic gametocytemia post-treatment, with none of 474 mosquitoes infected post-treatment arising from submicroscopic gametocytes.
   Conclusions
   In a setting of established ACT resistance, a single dose of 45mg primaquine added to DHP rapidly and significantly reduced gametocytemia, while DHP-alone failed to reduce gametocytemia and prevent malaria transmission to mosquitoes. Continued efforts to make single dose primaquine widely available are needed to help achieve malaria elimination.

TI A portable image-based cytometer for rapid malaria detection and
   quantification
SO PLOS ONE
AB Increasing resistance by malaria parasites to currently used antimalarials across the developing world warrants timely detection and classification so that appropriate drug combinations can be administered before clinical complications arise. However, this is often challenged by low levels of infection (referred to as parasitemia) and presence of predominantly young parasitic forms in the patients' peripheral blood. Herein, we developed a simple, inexpensive and portable image-based cytometer that detects and numerically counts Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells (iRBCs) from Giemsa-stained smears derived from infected blood. Our cytometer is able to classify all parasitic subpopulations by quantifying the area occupied by the parasites within iRBCs, with high specificity, sensitivity and negligible false positives (similar to 0.0025%). Moreover, we demonstrate the application of our image-based cytometer in testing anti-malarial efficacy against a commercial flow cytometer and demonstrate comparable results between the two methods. Collectively, these results highlight the possibility to use our image-based cytometer as a cheap, rapid and accurate alternative for antimalarial testing without compromising on efficiency and minimal processing time. With appropriate filters applied into the algorithm, to rule out leukocytes and reticulocytes, our cytometer may also be used for field diagnosis of malaria.

TI Preferential suppression of Anopheles gambiae host sequences allows
   detection of the mosquito eukaryotic microbiome
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The vector microbiota is a likely factor influencing parasite transmission. The prokaryotic microbiota of mosquitoes is efficiently surveyed by sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. However, identification of the eukaryotic microbiota by targeting the 18s rRNA gene is challenging due to simultaneous amplification of the abundant 18s rRNA gene target in the mosquito host. Consequently, the eukaryotic microbial diversity of mosquitoes is vastly underexplored. An efficient methodology is needed to identify this component of the microbiota, expected to include relatives of Plasmodium. Here, we use defined panels of Anopheles samples from West Africa to test two experimental PCR clamp approaches to maximize the specific amplification of 18s rRNA gene hypervariable regions from eukaryotic microbes: anneal-inhibiting blocking primers and peptide-nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide blockers. Of the two, PNA blockers were the only efficient blocking strategy, allowing a reduction of mosquito 18s rRNA gene sequences by more than 80% for the V4 hypervariable region. These PNA blockers will facilitate taxonomic profiling of the eukaryotic microbiota of the A. gambiae species complex, and contribute to a better understanding of microbial influence upon immunity and pathogen infection.

TI Parasites Causing Cerebral Falciparum Malaria Bind Multiple Endothelial
   Receptors and Express EPCR and ICAM-1-Binding PfEMP1
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) mediates the binding and accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IE) to blood vessels and tissues. Specific interactions have been described between PfEMP1 and human endothelial proteins CD36, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR); however, cytoadhesion patterns typical for pediatric malaria syndromes and the associated PfEMP1 members are still undefined.
   Methods. In a cohort of 94 hospitalized children with malaria, we characterized the binding properties of IE collected on admission, and var gene transcription using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. IE from patients with cerebral malaria were more likely to bind EPCR and ICAM-1 than IE from children with uncomplicated malaria (P = .007). The level of transcripts encoding CIDR alpha 1.4 and CIDR alpha 1.5 domain subclasses was higher in patients with severe disease (P <.05). IE populations exhibiting binding to all 3 receptors had higher levels of transcripts encoding PfEMP1 with CIDRa1.4 and Duffy binding-like (DBL)-beta 3 domains than parasites, which only bound CD36.
   Conclusions. These results underpin the significance of EPCR binding in pediatric malaria patients that require hospital admission, and support the notion that complementary receptor interactions of EPCR binding PfEMP1 with ICAM-1 amplifies development of severe malaria symptoms.

TI Identification of the Plasmodium species in clinical samples from
   children residing in five epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background: Malaria in Cameroon was previously known to be caused solely by Plasmodium falciparum but today, evidence points to other Plasmodium species including P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. The purpose of this study was to identify the Plasmodium species in clinical samples from children residing in five epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon, so as to advise control policies.
   Methods: One thousand six hundred nine febrile children (<= 15 years) were recruited from five epidemiological strata of malaria including the Sudano-sahelian (SS) strata, the High inland plateau (HIP) strata, the South Cameroonian Equatorial forest (SCEF) strata, the High western plateau (HWP) strata and the Coastal (C) strata. Malaria parasites were detected by Giemsa microscopy (GM) while a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the Plasmodium species. Statistical analysis performed included the Pearson chi-square test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
   Results: The PCR-adjusted prevalence of malaria was 17.6%. The detection rate of PCR was higher than GM (p= 0.05). However, GM demonstrated a high sensitivity (85.5%) and specificity (100%) and, overall, a perfectly correlated agreement with PCR (97.5%). The prevalence of malaria was significantly higher in children between 60 and 119 months (p < 0.001) and in Limbe (in the Coastal strata) (p < 0.001). Contrariwise, the prevalence of malaria was not associated with gender (p = 0.239). P. falciparum was identified in all (100%) the cases of malaria; P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi were all absent. No case of mixed infection was identified.
   Conclusions: P. falciparum was the only species causing clinical malaria in the target population, which is contrary to studies that have reported P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale as causing clinical malaria in Cameroon.

TI Molecular diagnosis of Plasmodium ovale by photo-induced electron
   transfer fluorogenic primers: PET-PCR
SO PLOS ONE
AB Accurate diagnosis of malaria infections continues to be challenging and elusive, especially in the detection of submicroscopic infections. Developing new malaria diagnostic tools that are sensitive enough to detect low-level infections, user friendly, cost effective and capable of performing large scale diagnosis, remains critical. We have designed novel self-quenching photo-induced electron transfer (PET) fluorogenic primers for the detection of P. ovale by real-time PCR. In our study, a total of 173 clinical samples, consisting of different malaria species, were utilized to test this novel PET-PCR primer. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using nested-PCR as the reference test. The novel primer set demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 99.2% (95% CI 85.2-99.8% and 95.2-99.9% respectively). Furthermore, the limit of detection for P. ovale was found to be 1 parasite/mu l. The PET-PCR assay is a new molecular diagnostic tool with comparable performance to other commonly used PCR methods. It is relatively easy to perform, and amiable to large scale malaria surveillance studies and malaria control and elimination programs. Further field validation of this novel primer will be helpful to ascertain the utility for large scale malaria screening programs.

TI Detection of the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch-13 gene P553L mutation in
   sporozoites isolated from mosquito salivary glands in South-Central
   Vietnam
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance against artemisinin in Southeast Asia. Mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch-13 (Pfk13) gene are associated with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the prevalence of mutations in PfK13 from sporozoite-stage parasites isolated from the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus mosquitoes.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were caught by human-landing catches at two locations within the Khanh Phu commune, South-Central Vietnam. Identification of Anopheles species was performed based on morphological features and nucleotide sequence analysis. Sporozoite-infected salivary glands were stored on filter paper and at 4-6 degrees C. A nested-PCR targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was used for Plasmodium species identification. Pfk13 was amplified by nested PCR, and subjected to nucleotide sequencing.
   Results: Five of 33 P. falciparum sporozoite samples carried the P553L mutation at the PfK13 locus. This mutation has been recorded previously in Vietnam, but not in Khanh Hoa province, were surveys of K13 polymorphism have not previously been carried out.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of mosquito-stage malaria parasite samples for studies on the molecular epidemiology of drug resistance.

TI Role of mass drug administration in elimination of Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria: a consensus modelling study
SO LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background Mass drug administration for elimination of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is recommended by WHO in some settings. We used consensus modelling to understand how to optimise the effects of mass drug administration in areas with low malaria transmission.
   Methods We collaborated with researchers doing field trials to establish a standard intervention scenario and standard transmission setting, and we input these parameters into four previously published models. We then varied the number of rounds of mass drug administration, coverage, duration, timing, importation of infection, and pre-administration transmission levels. The outcome of interest was the percentage reduction in annual mean prevalence of P falciparum parasite rate as measured by PCR in the third year after the final round of mass drug administration.
   Findings The models predicted differing magnitude of the effects of mass drug administration, but consensus answers were reached for several factors. Mass drug administration was predicted to reduce transmission over a longer timescale than accounted for by the prophylactic effect alone. Percentage reduction in transmission was predicted to be higher and last longer at lower baseline transmission levels. Reduction in transmission resulting from mass drug administration was predicted to be temporary, and in the absence of scale-up of other interventions, such as vector control, transmission would return to pre-administration levels. The proportion of the population treated in a year was a key determinant of simulated effectiveness, irrespective of whether people are treated through high coverage in a single round or new individuals are reached by implementation of several rounds. Mass drug administration was predicted to be more effective if continued over 2 years rather than 1 year, and if done at the time of year when transmission is lowest.
   Interpretation Mass drug administration has the potential to reduce transmission for a limited time, but is not an effective replacement for existing vector control. Unless elimination is achieved, mass drug administration has to be repeated regularly for sustained effect.

TI Efficacy and safety of artemether lumefantrine for the treatment of
   uncomplicated falciparum malaria at sentinel sites in Mozambique, 2015
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs continues to challenge malaria control. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the first-line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, in children under five years of age in Mozambique. We conducted a prospective one-arm study to evaluate the clinical and parasitological efficacy of AL over 28 days at four sentinel sites, using the WHO protocol for assessing the efficacy of antimalarial treatment. mspl, msp2 and glurp genes were analysed by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate recrudescence from re-infection with malaria parasites. Haemoglobin concentration was recorded at baseline and on days 7, 14 and 28. A total of 349 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited at the four sentinel sites. Adequate clinical and parasitological response to AL on day 28 follow-up varied from 96.3% to 100% after correction by PCR. The drug was well tolerated, and no adverse event related to the drug was reported. AL, the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mozambique, remains highly efficacious at the study sites. Monitoring of the efficacy of the recommended antimalarial drugs should be continued in order to detect any emerging threat to their efficacy.

TI Epidemiology of polyparasitism with Taenia soliwn, schistosomes and
   soil-transmitted helminths in the co-endemic village of Malanga,
   Democratic Republic of Congo
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Helminth co-infections are common in sub-Saharan Africa. However, little is known about the distribution and determinants of co-infections with Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis. Building on a previous community based study on human cysticercosis in Malanga village, we investigated co-infections with Taenia solium, soil transmitted helminths (STHs) and Schistosoma spp and associated risk factors in a random subsample of 330 participants. Real time PCR assays were used to detect DNA of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), 7'. solium and Schistosoma in stool samples and Schistosoma DNA in urine samples. Serum samples were tested for T. solium cysticercosis using the B158/B60 monoclonal antibody-based antigen ELISA. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were applied to assess associations of single and co-infections with common risk factors (age, sex, area, hygiene) as well as pair wise associations between helminth species.
   Overall, 240 (72.7%) participants were infected with at least one helminth species; 128 (38.8%) harbored at least two helminth species (16.1% with STHs-Schistosoma, 14.5% with STHs-T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis and 8.2% with Schistosoma-T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis co-infections). No significant associations were found between Schistosoma-T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis co-infection and any of the risk factors studied. Males (OR = 2 (95%CI = 1.1-5), p = 0.03) and open defecation behavior (OR = 3.8 (95%CI = 1.1-6.5), p = 0.04) were associated with higher odds of STHs-T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis co-infection.. Village districts that were found at high risk of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis were also at high risk of co-infection with STHs and T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis (OR = 3.2 (95%CI = 1.1-7.8), p = 0.03). Significant pair-wise associations were found between T. solium cysticerci and Necator americans (OR = 2.2 (95%CI = 1.2-3.8), p < 0.01) as well as Strongyloides stercoralis (OR = 2.7 (95%CI = 1.1-6.5), p = 0.02).
   These findings show that co-infections with T. solium are common in this polyparasitic community in DRC. Our results on risk factors of helminth co-infections and specific associations between helminths may contribute to a better integration of control within programmes that target more than one NTD.

TI Bionomics of Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera:
   Culicidae) in Relation to Malaria Transmission in East-Central India
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB The southern districts of Odisha State in east-central India have been highly endemic for falciparum malaria for many decades. However, there is no adequate information on the abundance of the vector species or their bionomics in relation to space and time in these districts. Therefore, a study was carried out on the entomological aspects of malaria transmission to generate such information. Collections of mosquitoes were made once during each of the three seasons in 128 villages selected from eight districts. Villages within the foot-hill ecotype had a significantly greater abundance of Anopheles fluviatilis James s. l., whereas the abundance of Anopheles culicifacies Giles s. l. was significantly greater in the plain ecotype. The abundance of An. fluviatilis was maximum during the cold season, whereas An. culicifacies abundance was highest during summer and rainy seasons. The maximum likelihood estimation of the malaria infection rate in An. fluviatilis was 1.78%, 6.05%, and 2.6% in Ganjam, Kalahandi, and Rayagada districts, respectively. The infection rate of An. culicifacies was 1.39% only in Kandhamal district; infected females were not detected elsewhere. Concurrently, the annual malaria parasite incidence (MPI) was significantly higher in hill-top (17.6) and foot-hill (14.4) villages compared to plain villages (4.1). The districts with more villages in hill-top and foot-hill ecotypes also had a greater abundance of An. fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, and exhibited a higher incidence of malaria than villages within the plain ecotype, where An. culicifacies was the most abundant vector.

TI Pfhrp2-Deleted Plasmodium falciparum Parasites in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo: A National Cross-sectional Survey
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) account for more than two-thirds of malaria diagnoses in Africa. Deletions of the Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 (pfhrp2) gene cause false-negative RDT results and have never been investigated on a national level. Spread of pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum mutants, resistant to detection by HRP2-based RDTs, would represent a serious threat to malaria elimination efforts.
   Methods. Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of 7,137 children under five years of age from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we tested 783 subjects with RDT-/PCR+ results using PCR assays to detect and confirm deletions of the pfhrp2 gene. Spatial and population genetic analyses were employed to examine the distribution and evolution of these parasites.
   Results. We identified 149 pfhrp2-deleted parasites, representing 6.4% of all P. falciparum infections country-wide (95% confidence interval 5.1-8.0%). Bayesian spatial analyses identified statistically significant clustering of pfhrp2 deletions near Kinshasa and Kivu. Population genetic analysis revealed significant genetic differentiation between wild-type and pfhrp2-deleted parasite populations (G(ST)=.046, p <=.00001).
   Conclusions. Pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum is a common cause of RDT-/ PCR+ malaria among asymptomatic children in the DRC and appears to be clustered within select communities. Surveillance for these deletions is needed, and alternatives to HRP2specific RDTs may be necessary.

TI Role of MyD88-adaptor-like gene polymorphism rs8177374 in modulation of
   malaria severity in the Pakistani population
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Introduction: The present study was designed to investigate the association between rs8177374 polymorphism and malaria symptoms due to exposure of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.
   Materials and methods: A total of 454 samples were included in the study (228 malaria patients and 226 healthy individuals). Malaria patients, divided into P. vivax and P. falciparum groups on the basis of the causative species of Plasmodium, were categorized into mild and severe on the basis of clinical outcomes according to WHO criteria. Healthy individuals were used as controls. Allele specific PCR based strategy was used for the identification of rs8177374 SNP.
   Results: MyD88-adaptor-like gene polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to malaria (p <0.001). C allele frequency (0.74) was higher in the population compared to T allele frequency (0.26). CT genotype increased the susceptibility of malaria (OR: 2.661; 95% CI: 1.722-4.113) and was positively associated with mild malaria (OR: 5.609; 95% CI: 3.479-9.044, p = 0.00). On the other hand, CC genotype was associated with severe malaria (OR: 3.116; 95% CI: 1.560-6.224, p = 0.00). P. vivax infection rate was higher in CT genotype carriers compared to other genotypes (OR: 3.616; 95% CI: 2.219-5.894, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: MyD88-adaptor-like/TIR domain containing adaptor protein polymorphism for single nucleotide polymorphism rs8177374 is related with the susceptibility of malaria. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI Prevalence of Inherited Hemoglobin Disorders and Relationships with
   Anemia and Micronutrient Status among Children in Yaounde and Douala,
   Cameroon
SO NUTRIENTS
AB Information on the etiology of anemia is necessary to design effective anemia control programs. Our objective was to measure the prevalence of inherited hemoglobin disorders (IHD) in a representative sample of children in urban Cameroon, and examine the relationships between IHD and anemia. In a cluster survey of children 12-59 months of age (n = 291) in Yaounde and Douala, we assessed hemoglobin (Hb), malaria infection, and plasma indicators of inflammation and micronutrient status. Hb S was detected by HPLC, and alpha(+) thalassemia (3.7 kb deletions) by PCR. Anemia (Hb < 110 g/L), inflammation, and malaria were present in 45%, 46%, and 8% of children. A total of 13.7% of children had HbAS, 1.6% had HbSS, and 30.6% and 3.1% had heterozygous and homozygous alpha(+) thalassemia. The prevalence of anemia was greater among HbAS compared to HbAA children (60.3 vs. 42.0%, p = 0.038), although mean Hb concentrations did not differ, p = 0.38). Hb and anemia prevalence did not differ among children with or without single gene deletion alpha(+) thalassemia. In multi-variable models, anemia was independently predicted by HbAS, HbSS, malaria, iron deficiency (ID; inflammation-adjusted ferritin < 12 mu g/L), higher C-reactive protein, lower plasma folate, and younger age. Elevated soluble transferrin receptor concentration (> 8.3 mg/L) was associated with younger age, malaria, greater mean reticulocyte counts, inflammation, HbSS genotype, and ID. IHD are prevalent but contribute modestly to anemia among children in urban Cameroon.

TI Mosquitoes on a plane: Disinsection will not stop the spread of
   vector-borne pathogens, a simulation study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Mosquito-borne diseases are increasingly being recognized as global threats, with increased air travel accelerating their occurrence in travelers and their spread to new locations. Since the early days of aviation, concern over the possible transportation of infected mosquitoes has led to recommendations to disinsect aircraft. Despite rare reports of mosquitoes, most likely transported on aircraft, infecting people far from endemics areas, it is unclear how important the role of incidentally transported mosquitoes is compared to the role of traveling humans. We used data for Plasmodium falciparum and dengue viruses to estimate the probability of introduction of these pathogens by mosquitoes and by humans via aircraft under ideal conditions. The probability of introduction of either pathogen by mosquitoes is low due to few mosquitoes being found on aircraft, low infection prevalence among mosquitoes, and high mortality. Even without disinsection, introduction via infected human travelers was far more likely than introduction by infected mosquitoes; more than 1000 times more likely for P. falciparum and more than 200 times more likely for dengue viruses. Even in the absence of disinsection and under the most favorable conditions, introduction of mosquito-borne pathogens via air travel is far more likely to occur as a result of an infected human travelling rather than the incidental transportation of infected mosquitoes. Thus, while disinsection may serve a role in preventing the spread of vector species and other invasive insects, it is unlikely to impact the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens.

TI Characterizing the malaria rural-to-urban transmission interface: The
   importance of reactive case detection
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Reported urban malaria cases are increasing in Latin America, however, evidence of such trend remains insufficient. Here, we propose an integrated approach that allows characterizing malaria transmission at the rural-to-urban interface by combining epidemiological, entomological, and parasite genotyping methods.
   Methods/Principal findings
   A descriptive study that combines active (ACD), passive (PCD), and reactive (RCD) case detection was performed in urban and peri-urban neighborhoods of Quibdo A, Colombia. Heads of households were interviewed and epidemiological surveys were conducted to assess malaria prevalence and identify potential risk factors. Sixteen primary cases, eight by ACD and eight by PCD were recruited for RCD. Using the RCD strategy, prevalence of 1% by microscopy (6/604) and 9% by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (52/604) were found. A total of 73 houses and 289 volunteers were screened leading to 41 secondary cases, all of them in peri-urban settings (14% prevalence). Most secondary cases were genetically distinct from primary cases indicating that there were independent occurrences. Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species (76.3%, 71/93), most of them being asymptomatic (46/71). Urban and peri-urban neighborhoods had significant socio-demographic differences. Twenty-four potential breeding sites were identified, all in peri-urban areas. The predominant vectors for 1,305 adults were Anopheles nuneztovari (56,2%) and An. Darlingi (42,5%). One An. nuneztovari specimen was confirmed naturally infected with P. falciparum by ELISA.
   Conclusions
   This study found no evidence supporting the existence of urban malaria transmission in Quibdo A. RCD strategy was more efficient for identifying malaria cases than ACD alone in areas where malaria transmission is variable and unstable. Incorporating parasite genotyping allows discovering hidden patterns of malaria transmission that cannot be detected otherwise. We propose to use the term "focal case" for those primary cases that lead to discovery of secondary but genetically unrelated malaria cases indicating undetected malaria transmission.

TI Predominance of asymptomatic and sub-microscopic infections
   characterizes the Plasmodium gametocyte reservoir in the Peruvian Amazon
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Malaria transmission requires that Anopheles mosquitoes ingest Plasmodium gametocyte stages circulating in the human bloodstream. In the context of malaria elimination, understanding the epidemiology of gametocytes relative to all Plasmodium infections and the contribution of asymptomatic and sub-microscopic parasite carriers to the gametocyte reservoir is necessary, especially in low endemic settings with predominance of P. vivax. A 13-month longitudinal study was conducted in two communities (n = 1935 individuals) of Loreto Department, Peru, with five active screenings for Plasmodium infections and gametocyte stages by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR, respectively. Parasite prevalence by qPCR was 7.2% for P. vivax (n = 520/7235; range by survey 6.0%-8.1%) and 3.2% for P. falciparum (n = 235/7235; range by survey 0.4%-7.7%). Submicroscopic infections accounted for 73.5% of P. vivax (range by survey 60%-89%) and almost the totality of P. falciparum cases. Gametocytes were found in 28.4% P. vivax infections (range by survey 18.7%-34.1%), with a peak of 61.5% in one community at the start of the transmission season. About 59.8% of all P. vivax gametocyte carriers were asymptomatic and 31.9% were sub-microscopic. Age patterns for gametocyte prevalence paralleled asexual stage infections and peaked among >15-25 year old individuals. Asexual parasite density was found to be the strongest predictor for P. vivax gametocyte presence in longitudinal multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2.33 [95% confidence interval 1.96, 2.78]; P<0.001). Despite significant differences in seasonality patterns and P. vivax prevalence found at the local scale, sub-microscopic and asymptomatic infections predominate and contribute significantly to the gametocyte reservoir in different communities of the Peruvian Amazon. Control and elimination campaigns need sensitive tools to detect all infections that escape routine malaria surveillance, which may contribute to maintain transmission in the region.

TI Effects of liver-stage clearance by Primaquine on gametocyte carriage of
   Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Primaquine (PQ) is the only currently licensed antimalarial that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses. It also clears mature P. falciparum (Pf) gametocytes, thereby reducing post-treatment transmission. Randomized PQ treatment in a treatment-to-reinfection cohort in Papua New Guinean children permitted the study of Pv and Pf gametocyte carriage after radical cure and to investigate the contribution of Pv relapses.
   Methods
   Children received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumefantrine plus either PQ or placebo. Blood samples were subsequently collected in 2- to 4-weekly intervals over 8 months. Gametocytes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR targeting pvs25 and pfs25.
   Results
   PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which was comparable to the effect of PQ on incidence of blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and to a lesser extent Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of gametocytes were significantly reduced in mixed-species infections compared to single-species infections for both species (ORPv = 0.39 [95% CI 0.25-0.62], ORPf = 0.33 [95% CI 0.18-0.60], p<0.001). No difference between the PQ and placebo treatment arms was observed in density of Pv gametocytes or in the proportion of Pv infections that carried gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment, likely caused by a relapsing hypnozoite, were equally likely to carry gametocytes than first infections after PQ treatment, likely caused by an infective mosquito bite.
   Conclusion
   Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia. Relapses thus contribute considerably to the Pv reservoir highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv.

TI Deep Sequencing of RNA from Blood and Oral Swab Samples Reveals the
   Presence of Nucleic Acid from a Number of Pathogens in Patients with
   Acute Ebola Virus Disease and Is Consistent with Bacterial Translocation
   across the Gut
SO MSPHERE
AB In this study, samples from the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak from patients in Guinea with Ebola virus disease (EVD) were analyzed to discover and classify what other pathogens were present. Throat swabs were taken from deceased EVD patients, and peripheral blood samples were analyzed that had been taken from patients when they presented at the treatment center with acute illness. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics were used to identify the potential microorganisms. This approach confirmed Ebola virus (EBOV) in all samples from patients diagnosed as acute positive for the virus by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in deployed field laboratories. Nucleic acid mapping to Plasmodium was also used on the patient samples, confirming results obtained with an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) conducted in the field laboratories. The data suggested that a high Plasmodium load, as determined by sequence read depth, was associated with mortality and influenced the host response, whereas a lower parasite load did not appear to affect outcome. The identifications of selected bacteria from throat swabs via RNA-seq were confirmed by culture. The data indicated that the potential pathogens identified in the blood samples were associated with translocation from the gut, suggesting the presence of bacteremia, which transcriptome data suggested may induce or aggravate the acute-phase response observed during EVD. Transcripts mapping to different viruses were also identified, including those indicative of lytic infections. The development of high-resolution analysis of samples from patients with EVD will help inform care pathways and the most appropriate general antimicrobial therapy to be used in a resource-poor setting.
   IMPORTANCE Our results highlight the identification of an array of pathogens in the blood of patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). This has not been done before, and the data have important implications for the treatment of patients with EVD, particularly considering antibiotic stewardship. We show that EVD patients who were also infected with Plasmodium, particularly at higher loads, had more adverse outcomes than patients with lower levels of Plasmodium. However, the presence of Plasmodium did not influence the innate immune response, and it is likely that the presence of EBOV dominated this response. Several viruses other than EBOV were identified, and bacteria associated with sepsis were also identified. These findings were indicative of bacterial translocation across the gut during the acute phase of EVD.

TI Entomological and parasitological parameters of malaria transmission in
   Douguia, Chad
SO MEDECINE ET SANTE TROPICALES
AB Background: Malaria remains a threat for many countries, especially in Chad where it is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Few reliable data exist, however, about the entomological and parasitological parameters of malaria transmission. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the entomological and parasitological parameters of malaria transmission in Douguia, a village located 75 km northeast of Ndjamena (Chad), as part of a training program for participants in Chad's malaria control program. Methodology: Mosquitoes were collected after morning pyrethroid spraying, with a mouth aspirator. The parasitological data were collected by a rapid diagnosis test or microscopic examination. Results: The study examined 350 subjects aged from 6 months to 80 years. The plasmodic index (PI) of Plasmodium falciparum was 25.4 % (n = 89) and the gametocygenic index (GI) 9.1 % (n = 32); they varied significantly from one age group to another (p = 10(-3)). The PI in pregnant women attending antenatal clinics was 18.7 % (n = 12/64). Three Anopheles species were found: Anopheles gambiae s.l, An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis. An. coluzzii accounted for 94.9 % of the An. gambiae s. s. The antigen sporozoite index (SI) was 4.5 %. Conclusion: Our results confirm the endemicity of malaria in Chad (Douguia) and underline the major role of An. gambiae s.l. in its transmission. However, repeated studies using PCR for Plasmodium detection would help to improve our understanding of its epidemiology.

TI Effect of pharmacogenetics on plasma lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and
   malaria treatment outcome in pregnant women
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Pregnancy has considerable effects on the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The role of pharmacogenetic variation on anti-malarial drug disposition and efficacy during pregnancy is not well investigated. The study aimed to examine the effect of pharmacogenetics on lumefantrine (LF) pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in pregnant women.
   Methods: Pregnant women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled and treated with artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) at Mkuranga and Kisarawe district hospitals in Coast Region of Tanzania. Day-7 LF plasma concentration and genotyping forCYP2B6 (c.516G>T, c.983T>C), CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5(*3, *6, *7) and ABCB1 c.4036A4G were determined. Blood smear for parasite quantification by microscopy, and dried blood spot for parasite screening and genotyping using qPCR and nested PCR were collected at enrolment up to day 28 to differentiate between reinfection from recrudescence. Treatment response was recorded following the WHO protocol.
   Results: In total, 92 pregnant women in their second and third trimester were included in the study and 424 samples were screened for presence of P. falciparum. Parasites were detected during the follow up period in 11 (12%) women between day 7 and 28 after treatment and PCR genotyping confirmed recrudescent infection in 7 (63.3%) women. The remaining four (36.4%) pregnant women had reinfection: one on day 14 and three on day 28. The overall PCR-corrected treatment failure rate was 9.0% (95% CI 4.4-17.4). Day 7 LF concentration was not significantly influenced by CYP2B6, CYP3A4*1B and ABCB1 c.4036A>G genotypes. Significant associations between CYP3A5 genotype and day 7 plasma LF concentrations was found, being higher in carriers of CYP3A5 defective variant alleles than CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. No significant influence of CYP2B6, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 c.4036A>Genotypes on malaria treatment outcome were observed. However, CYP3A4*1B did affect malaria treatment outcome in pregnant women followed up for 28 days (P = 0.018).
   Conclusions: Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may influence LF pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in pregnant women.

TI Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations in southeast and
   western Myanmar
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The genetic diversity of malaria parasites reflects the complexity and size of the parasite populations. This study was designed to explore the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations collected from two southeastern areas (Shwekyin and Myawaddy bordering Thailand) and one western area (Kyauktaw bordering Bangladesh) of Myanmar.
   Methods: A total of 267 blood samples collected from patients with acute P. falciparum infections during 2009 and 2010 were used for genotyping at the merozoite surface protein 1 (Msp1), Msp2 and glutamate-rich protein (Glurp) loci.
   Results: One hundred and eighty four samples were successfully genotyped at three genes. The allelic distributions of the three genes were all significantly different among three areas. MAD20 and 3D7 were the most prevalent alleles in three areas for Msp1 and Msp2, respectively. The Glurp allele with a bin size of 700-750 bp was the most prevalent both in Shwekyin and Myawaddy, whereas two alleles with bin sizes of 800-850 bp and 900-1000 bp were the most prevalent in the western site Kyauktaw. Overall, 73.91% of samples contained multiclonal infections, resulting in a mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.94. Interestingly, the MOI level presented a rising trend with the order of Myawaddy, Kyauktaw and Shwekyin, which also paralleled with the increasing frequencies of Msp1 RO33 and Msp2 FC27 200-250 bp alleles. Msp1 and Msp2 genes displayed higher levels of diversity and higher MOI rates than Glurp. PCR revealed four samples (two from Shwekyin and two from Myawaddy) with mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax.
   Conclusions: This study genotyped parasite clinical samples from two southeast regions and one western state of Myanmar at the Msp1, Msp2 and Glurp loci, which revealed high levels of genetic diversity and mixed-strain infections of P. falciparum populations at these sites. The results indicated that malaria transmission intensity in these regions remained high and more strengthened control efforts are needed. The genotypic data provided baseline information for monitoring the impacts of malaria elimination efforts in the region.

TI Host age and expression of genes involved in red blood cell invasion in
   Plasmodium falciparum field isolates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Plasmodium falciparum proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion are main targets of acquired immunity and important vaccine candidates. We hypothesized that anti-parasite immunity acquired upon exposure would limit invasion-related gene (IRG) expression and affect the clinical impact of the infection. 11 IRG transcript levels were measured in P. falciparum isolates by RT-PCR, and IgG/IgM against invasion ligands by Luminex (R), in 50 Mozambican adults, 25 children with severe malaria (SM) and 25 with uncomplicated malaria (UM). IRG expression differences among groups and associations between IRG expression and clinical/immunologic parameters were assessed. IRG expression diversity was higher in parasites infecting children than adults (p = 0.022). eba140 and ptramp expression decreased with age (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively) whereas p41 expression increased (p = 0.022). pfrh5 reduction in expression was abrupt early in life. Parasite density decreased with increasing pfrh5 expression (p < 0.001) and, only in children, parasite density increased with p41 expression (p = 0.007), and decreased with eba175 (p = 0.013). Antibody responses and IRG expression were not associated. In conclusion, IRG expression is associated with age and parasite density, but not with specific antibody responses in the acute phase of infection. Our results confirm the importance of multi-antigen vaccines development to avoid parasite immune escape when tested in malaria-exposed individuals.

TI Malaria in Dielmo, a Senegal village: Is its elimination possible after
   seven years of implementation of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets?
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   The malaria burden has decreased significantly in recent years in Africa through the widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and long-lasting insectici-detreated nets (LLINs). However, the occurrence of malaria resurgences, the loss of immunity of exposed populations constitute among other factors, serious concerns about the future of malaria elimination efforts. This study investigated the evolution of malaria morbidity in Dielmo (Senegal) before and after the implementation of LLINs.
   Methods
   A longitudinal study was carried out in Dielmo over eight years, from July 2007 to July 2015. In July 2008, LLINs were offered to all villagers, and in July 2011 and August 2014 the LLINs were renewed. A survey on LLINs use was done each quarter of the year. Thick smears stained with Giemsa, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were performed for all cases of fever to assess malaria clinical attacks. Malaria cases were treated with ACT since June 2006.
   Results
   Malaria morbidity has decreased significantly since the implementation of LLINs in Dielmo, together with ACT. However, malaria resurgences have occurred twice during the seven years of LLINs use. These resurgences occurred the first time during the third year after the introduction of LLINs (aIRR (adjusted incidence-rate ratio) [95% CI] = 5.90 [3.53; 9.88] p< 0.001) and a second time during the third year after the renewal of LLINs (aIRR [95% CI] = 5.60 [3.34; 9.39] p<0.001). Sixty-nine percent (69%) of the nets tested for their long-lasting insecticidal activity remained effective after 3 years of use.
   Conclusion
   Good management of malaria cases by the use of ACT as first-line treatment against malaria in addition to the use of LLINshas significantly reduced malaria in Dielmo and allowed to reach the phase of pre-elimination of the disease. However, the occurrence of malaria resurgences raised serious concerns about malaria elimination, which would require additional tools in this village.

TI Use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests by community health workers in
   Afghanistan: cluster randomised trial
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends parasitological diagnosis of malaria before treatment, but use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) by community health workers (CHWs) has not been fully tested within health services in south and central Asia. mRDTs could allow CHWs to diagnose malaria accurately, improving treatment of febrile illness.
   Methods: A cluster randomised trial in community health services was undertaken in Afghanistan. The primary outcome was the proportion of suspected malaria cases correctly treated for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed malaria and PCR negative cases receiving no antimalarial drugs measured at the level of the patient. CHWs from 22 clusters (clinics) received standard training on clinical diagnosis and treatment of malaria; 11 clusters randomised to the intervention arm received additional training and were provided with mRDTs. CHWs enrolled cases of suspected malaria, and the mRDT results and treatments were compared to blind-read PCR diagnosis.
   Results: In total, 256 CHWs enrolled 2400 patients with 2154 (89.8%) evaluated. In the intervention arm, 75.3% (828/ 1099) were treated appropriately vs. 17.5% (185/1055) in the control arm (cluster adjusted risk ratio: 3.72, 95% confidence interval 2.40-5.77; p < 0.001). In the control arm, 85.9% (164/191) with confirmed Plasmodium vivax received chloroquine compared to 45.1% (70/155) in the intervention arm (p < 0.001). Overuse of chloroquine in the control arm resulted in 87.6% (813/928) of those with no malaria (PCR negative) being treated vs. 10.0% (95/947) in the intervention arm, p < 0.001. In the intervention arm, 71.4% (30/42) of patients with P. falciparum did not receive artemisinin-based combination therapy, partly because operational sensitivity of the RDTs was low (53.2%, 38.1-67.9). There was high concordance between recorded RDT result and CHW prescription decisions: 826/950 (87.0%) with a negative test were not prescribed an antimalarial. Co-trimoxazole was prescribed to 62.7% of malaria negative patients in the intervention arm and 15.0% in the control arm.
   Conclusions: While introducing mRDT reduced overuse of antimalarials, this action came with risks that need to be considered before use at scale: an appreciable proportion of malaria cases will be missed by those using current mRDTs. Higher sensitivity tests could be used to detect all cases. Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs in the control arm was replaced with increased antibiotic prescription in the intervention arm, resulting in a probable overuse of antibiotics.

TI Resisting and tolerating P-falciparum in pregnancy under different
   malaria transmission intensities
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: Resistance and tolerance to Plasmodium falciparum can determine the progression of malaria disease. However, quantitative evidence of tolerance is still limited. We investigated variations in the adverse impact of P. falciparum infections among African pregnant women under different intensities of malaria transmission.
   Methods: P. falciparum at delivery was assessed by microscopy, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and placental histology in 946 HIV-uninfected and 768 HIV-infected pregnant women from Benin, Gabon, Kenya and Mozambique. Resistance was defined by the proportion of submicroscopic infections and the levels of anti-parasite antibodies quantified by Luminex, and tolerance by the relationship of pregnancy outcomes with parasite densities at delivery.
   Results: P. falciparum prevalence by qPCR in peripheral and/or placental blood of HIV-uninfected Mozambican, Gabonese and Beninese women at delivery was 6% (21/340), 11% (28/257) and 41% (143/349), respectively. The proportion of peripheral submicroscopic infections was higher in Benin (83%) than in Mozambique (60%) and Gabon (55%; P = 0.033). Past or chronic placental P. falciparum infection was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth in Mozambican newborns (OR = 7.05, 95% CI 1.79 to 27.82). Microscopic infections were associated with reductions in haemoglobin levels at delivery among Mozambican women (-1.17 g/dL, 95% CI -2.09 to -0.24) as well as with larger drops in haemoglobin levels from recruitment to delivery in Mozambican (-1.66 g/dL, 95% CI -2.68 to -0.64) and Gabonese (-0.91 g/dL, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.02) women. Doubling qPCR-peripheral parasite densities in Mozambican women were associated with decreases in haemoglobin levels at delivery (-0.16 g/dL, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02) and increases in the drop of haemoglobin levels (-0.29 g/dL, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14). Beninese women had higher anti-parasite IgGs than Mozambican women (P < 0.001). No difference was found in the proportion of submicroscopic infections nor in the adverse impact of P. falciparum infections in HIV-infected women from Kenya (P. falciparum prevalence by qPCR: 9%, 32/351) and Mozambique (4%, 15/417).
   Conclusions: The lowest levels of resistance and tolerance in pregnant women from areas of low malaria transmission were accompanied by the largest adverse impact of P. falciparum infections. Exposure-dependent mechanisms developed by pregnant women to resist the infection and minimise pathology can reduce malaria-related adverse outcomes. Distinguishing both types of defences is important to understand how reductions in transmission can affect malaria disease.

TI A dual colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for
   identifying the zoonotic malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi with a
   potential application for the specific diagnosis of knowlesi malaria in
   peripheral-level laboratories of Southeast Asia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Plasmodium knowlesi is primarily responsible for zoonotic malaria in several Southeast Asian countries. Precise identification of the parasite in the blood of patients presently relies on an expensive and elaborate PCR procedure because microscopic examination of blood and other available field identification techniques lack adequate specificity. Therefore, the use of a simple and inexpensive dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, analogous to FISH assays recently described for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, was investigated as a potential tool for identifying P. knowlesi.
   Results: A P. knowlesi 18S rDNA sequence-based DNA probe was used to test thin blood smears of P. knowlesi by FISH, and fluorescence viewed in a light microscope fitted with a light emitting diode light source and appropriate emission and barrier filters. The limit of detection in the P. knowlesi FISH assay was 84 parasites per ae l in infected monkey blood and 61 parasites per ae l for P. knowlesi cultured in human blood. The P. knowlesi-specific FISH probe detected only P. knowlesi and not P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, P. vivax or a panel of other human blood-borne pathogens. A previously described Plasmodium genus-specific probe used simultaneously in the P. knowlesi FISH assay reacted with all tested Plasmodium species.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first description of a FISH assay for P. knowlesi that is potentially useful for diagnosing infections in remote laboratories in endemic countries.

TI Non-falciparum malaria imported mainly from Africa: a review from a
   Portuguese hospital
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Non-falciparum malaria (NFM) has been reported to be responsible for around 25% of imported malaria cases in Europe but is often neglected due to its less severe clinical course when compared to Plasmodium falciparum. Differentiation between species is however crucial for a correct approach. The objective of this study is to report the cases of this often missed aetiology of malaria in a tertiary hospital in Portugal.
   Methods: Data were retrospectively analysed from patients admitted from January 2006 to August 2016 with a NFM diagnosis based on microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) (BinaxNow (R)) and/or PCR. Epidemiologic and clinical aspects were reviewed.
   Results: A total of 19 NFM cases were diagnosed, corresponding to 8.4% of the total 225 cases of malaria. Seventeen (89%) were male with a median age of 41 years. All but one case were imported from sub-Saharan Africa, with 12 (63%) of the cases returned from Angola. Microscopy was positive for all patients and correctly identified the species in 12 (63%) patients. BinaxNOW (R) was performed in all patients and it was positive in 11 cases, showing a sensitivity of 58%. PCR was performed in nine patients and was positive in eight of them, being responsible for the identification of the species in four cases. Plasmodium malariae accounted for 37% (n = 7) of the cases, Plasmodium ovale for 32% (n = 6) and Plasmodium vivax for 17% (n = 3). In three (16%) patients, morphology was suggestive of P. vivax or P. ovale, but precise species identification was not possible. Regarding presentation, fever was the most reported symptom, and the most frequent laboratory finding was thrombocytopaenia. Quinine-doxycycline was prescribed in eleven patients (58%), chloroquine in six cases (32%) and artemether-lumefantrine in two (11%). All of the patients showed clinical improvement.
   Conclusions: NFM remains an important cause of imported malaria in patients from sub-Saharan Africa, alone or as mixed infection with P. falciparum. Access to PCR techniques facilitates diagnosis, as low sensitivity from RDTs and microscopy are to be expected.

TI Multiplication rate variation in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
   falciparum
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is important to understand intrinsic variation in asexual blood stage multiplication rates of the most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Here, multiplication rates of long-term laboratory adapted parasite clones and new clinical isolates were measured, using a newly standardised assay of growth from low starting density in replicate parallel cultures with erythrocytes from multiple different donors, across multiple cycles. Multiplication rates of long-term established clones were between 7.6 and 10.5 fold per 48 hours, with clone Dd2 having a higher rate than others (clones 3D7, HB3 and D10). Parasite clone-specific growth was then analysed in co-culture assays with all possible heterologous pairwise combinations. This showed that co-culture of different parasites did not affect their replication rates, indicating that there were no suppressive interactions operating between parasites. Multiplication rates of eleven new clinical isolates were measured after a few weeks of culture, and showed a spectrum of replication rates between 2.3 and 6.0 fold per 48 hours, the entire range being lower than for the long-term laboratory adapted clones. Multiplication rate estimates remained stable over time for several isolates tested repeatedly up to three months after culture initiation, indicating considerable persistence of this important trait variation.

TI Malaria epidemiology in low-endemicity areas of the northern coast of
   Ecuador: high prevalence of asymptomatic infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The recent scale-up in malaria control measures in Latin America has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of reported cases in several countries including Ecuador, where it presented a low malaria incidence in recent years (558 reported cases in 2015) with occasional outbreaks of both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in the coastal and Amazonian regions. This success in malaria control in recent years has led Ecuador to transition its malaria policy from control to elimination.
   Results: This study evaluated the general knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) about malaria, as well as its prevalence in four communities of an endemic area in northwest Ecuador. A total of 258 interviews to assess KAP in the community indicated that most people in the study area have a basic knowledge about the disease but did not use to contribute to its control. Six hundred and forty-eight blood samples were collected and analysed by thick blood smear and real-time PCR. In addition, the distribution of the infections was mapped in the study communities. Although, no parasites were found by microscopy, by PCR the total malaria prevalence was 7.5% (6.9% P. vivax and 0.6% P. falciparum), much higher than expected and comparable to that reported in endemic areas of neighbouring countries with higher malaria transmission. Serology using ELISA and immunofluorescence indicated 27% respondents for P. vivax and 22% respondents for P. falciparum.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that despite a great malaria reduction in Ecuador, transition from control to elimination would demand further improvement in malaria diagnostics, including active case detection to identify and treat parasite asymptomatic carriers, as well as community participation in its elimination.

TI Return of chloroquine sensitivity to Africa? Surveillance of African
   Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance through malaria imported to
   China
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Chloroquine (CQ) was the cornerstone of anti-malarial treatment in Africa for almost 50 years, but has been widely withdrawn due to the emergence and spread of resistance. Recent reports have suggested that CQ-susceptibility may return following the cessation of CQ usage. Here, we monitor CQ sensitivity and determine the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in the CQ resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) of Plasmodium falciparum isolates recently imported from Africa to China.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from falciparum malaria patients returning to China from various countries in Africa. Isolates were tested for their sensitivity to CQ using the SYBR Green I test ex vivo, and for a subset of samples, in vitro following culture adaptation. Mutations at positions 72-76 and codon 220 of the pfcrt gene were analyzed by sequencing and confirmed by PCR-RFLP. Correlations between drug sensitivity and pfcrt polymorphisms were investigated.
   Results: Of 32 culture adapted isolates assayed, 17 (53.1%), 6 (18.8%) and 9 (28.1%) were classified as sensitive, moderately resistant, and highly resistant, respectively. In vitro CQ susceptibility was related to point mutations in the pfcrt gene, the results indicating a strong association between pfcrt genotype and drug sensitivity. A total of 292 isolates were typed at the pfcrt locus, and the prevalence of the wild type (CQ sensitive) haplotype CVMNK in isolates from East, South, North, West and Central Africa were 91.4%, 80.0%, 73.3%, 53.3% and 51.7%, respectively. The only mutant haplotype observed was CVIET, and this was almost always linked to an additional mutation at A220S.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that a reduction in drug pressure following withdrawal of CQ as a first-line drug may lead to a resurgence in CQ sensitive parasites. The prevalence of wild-type pfcrt CQ sensitive parasites from East, South and North Africa was higher than from the West and Central areas, but this varied greatly between countries. Further surveillance is required to assess whether the prevalence of CQ resistant parasites will continue to decrease in the absence of widespread CQ usage.

TI Asymptomatic plasmodial infection in Colombian pregnant women
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Information about asymptomatic plasmodial infection is scarce in the world, and the current antimalarial program goals (control, elimination, and eradication) demand this evidence to be well documented in different populations and malaria transmission settings. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of API in Colombian pregnant women at delivery. A retrospective prevalence survey was used. Women were recruited at hospital obstetric facility in each of the municipalities of Turbo, Necocli in Antioquia department, and Puerto Libertador in Cordoba department. Malaria infection was tested by thick blood smear (TBS) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ninety-six pregnant women at delivery were studied: 95% were asymptomatic (91/96), 45% had asymptomatic plasmodial infection (API) by qPCR (41/91), and only 8% (7/91) had API by microscopy. The prevalence of submicroscopic infections (TBS negative and qPCR positive) was very high, 37% (34/91) in asymptomatic women and 41% (39/96) in total women studied (91 asymptomatic and 5 symptomatic). The prevalence of API in Colombian pregnant women is much higher than which is expected for a country that does not have the level of malaria transmission as Sub-Saharan African countries.

TI Comparison of microscopy and PCR for the detection of human Plasmodium
   species and Plasmodium knowlesi in southern Myanmar
SO ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Objectives: To determine the distribution of Plasmodium (P) species including Plasmodium knowlesi and to compare the specificity and sensitivity of microscopy with nested PCR in malaria diagnosis.
   Methods: The study was conducted in Kawthaung, southern Myanmar. Ninety clinically suspected malaria patients were screened for malaria by Giemsa stained microscopy and confirmed by nested PCR.
   Results: Among the participants, 57 (63.3%) were positive and 33 (36.7%) were negative by microscopy. Of positive samples, 39 (68.4%) were Plasmodium falciparum, 17 (29.8%) Plasmodium vivax and 1 (1.8%) Plasmodium malariae, whereas 59-amplified by PCR were 40 (67.8%), 18 (30.5%) and 1 (1.7%) respectively. PCR amplified 2 microscopy negative samples. Two samples of P. falciparum detected by microscopy were amplified as P. vivax and vice versa. All samples were negative for Plasmodium ovale, P. knowlesi and mixed infections. Microscopy had a very good measure of agreement (kappa = 0.95) compared to nested PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of microscopy for diagnosis of P. falciparum were 92.5% (95% CI: 79.6-98.4) and 96.0% (95% CI: 86.3-99.5) respectively, whereas for P. vivax were 83.3% (95% CI: 58.6-96.4) and 97.2% (95% CI: 90.3-99.7).
   Conclusions: P. knowlesi was not detected by both microscopy and PCR. Giemsa stained microscopy can still be applied as primary method for malaria diagnosis and is considered as gold standard. As to the lower sensitivity of microscopy for vivax malaria, those with previous history of malaria and relapse cases should be diagnosed by RDT or PCR combined with microscopy. Inaccuracy of species diagnosis highlighted the requirement of training and refresher courses for microscopists.

TI Randomised controlled trial of two sequential artemisinin-based
   combination therapy regimens to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria
   in African children: a protocol to investigate safety, efficacy and
   adherence
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background Management of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria relies on artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). These highly effective regimens have contributed to reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality. However, artemisinin resistance in Asia and changing parasite susceptibility to ACT in Africa have now been well documented. Strategies that retain current ACT as efficacious treatments are urgently needed.
   Methods We present an open-label, randomised three-arm clinical trial protocol in three African settings representative of varying malaria epidemiology to investigate whether prolonged ACT-based regimens using currently available formulations can eliminate potentially resistant parasites. The protocol investigates whether a sequential course of two licensed ACT in 1080 children aged 6-120 months exhibits superior efficacy against acute P. falciparum malaria and non-inferior safety compared with standard single-course ACT given to 540 children. The primary endpoint is PCR-corrected clinical and parasitological response at day 42 or day 63 of follow-up. Persistence of PCR-detectable parasitaemia at day 3 is analysed as a key covariate. Secondary endpoints include gametocytaemia, occurrence of treatment-elated adverse events in the double-ACT versus single-ACT arms, carriage of molecular markers of drug resistance, drug kinetics and patient adherence to treatment.
   Discussion This protocol addresses efficacy and safety of sequential ACT regimens in P. falciparum malaria in Africa. The approach is designed to extend the useful life of this class of antimalarials with maximal impact and minimal delay, by deploying licensed medicines that could be swiftly implemented as sequential double ACT by National Malaria Control Programmes, before emerging drug resistance in Africa becomes a major threat to public health.

TI Identification and characterization of ARS-like sequences as putative
   origin(s) of replication in human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB DNA replication is a fundamental process in genome maintenance, and initiates from several genomic sites (origins) in eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, conserved sequences known as autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) provide a landing pad for the origin recognition complex (ORC), leading to replication initiation. Although origins from higher eukaryotes share some common sequence features, the definitive genomic organization of these sites remains elusive. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum undergoes multiple rounds of DNA replication; therefore, control of initiation events is crucial to ensure proper replication. However, the sites of DNA replication initiation and the mechanism by which replication is initiated are poorly understood. Here, we have identified and characterized putative origins in P. falciparum by bioinformatics analyses and experimental approaches. An autocorrelation measure method was initially used to search for regions with marked fluctuation (dips) in the chromosome, which we hypothesized might contain potential origins. Indeed, S. cerevisiae ARS consensus sequences were found in dip regions. Several of these P. falciparum sequences were validated with chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, nascent strand abundance and a plasmid stability assay. Subsequently, the same sequences were used in yeast to confirm their potential as origins in vivo. Our results identify the presence of functional ARSs in P. falciparum and provide meaningful insights into replication origins in these deadly parasites. These data could be useful in designing transgenic vectors with improved stability for transfection in P. falciparum.

TI Comparative evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test, an antibody ELISA,
   and a pLDH ELISA in detecting asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia in blood
   donors in Buea, Cameroon
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background: In malaria endemic areas, infected blood donors serve as a source of infection to blood recipients, which may adversely affect their prognosis. This necessitates the proper screening of blood to be used for transfusion in these areas. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia in blood donors in Buea, Cameroon, and to evaluate the performance of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), a malaria antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) ELISA in the detection of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia in the target population.
   Methods: In a prospective study conducted between September 2015 and June 2016, 1 240 potential blood donors were enrolled. The donors were screened for malaria parasites using Giemsa microscopy (GM) and a RDT. A sub-sample of 184 samples, comprising 88 positive and 96 negative samples, were selected for the evaluation of the pLDH ELISA and the antibody ELISA. The chi-square test and correlation analysis were performed as part of the statistical analyses. The statistical significance cut-off was set at P < 0.05.
   Results: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia in this study was found to be 8.1% (95% CI: 6.6 - 9.7). The prevalence was not observed to be dependent on the age or sex of the participants. The RDT had a sensitivity (88. 0%), specificity (99.1%), and negative predictive value (99.0%) higher than the ELISAs. The performance of the pLDH ELISA, which demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (91.6%), was generally comparable to the RDT. The sensitivity was lowest with the antibody ELISA (69.9%), which also demonstrated the highest false positive and false negative rates. The detection threshold for the pLDH (three parasites/mu l) was lower compared to the RDT (50 - 60 parasites/mu l). Non-significant positive correlations were observed between the parasite density and the pLDH titers and malaria antibody titers.
   Conclusions: Overall, the RDT and the pLDH ELISA demonstrated a perfectly correlated agreement with GM, meanwhile the antibody ELISA demonstrated a substantially correlated agreement with GM. The pLDH is therefore recommended for mass screening of blood (to detect malaria parasitaemia) for transfusions in the study area. However, where this is not feasible, an RDT will suffice.

TI Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus artesunate-amodiaquine for
   treatment of malaria infection in pregnancy in Ghana: an open-label,
   randomised, non-inferiority trial
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB OBJECTIVE To determine whether dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) is non-inferior to artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) for treating uncomplicated malaria infection in pregnancy.
   METHODS A total of 417 second/third trimester pregnant women with confirmed asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia were randomised to receive DHA-PPQ or ASAQ over 3 days. Women were followed up on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 after treatment start and at delivery for parasitological, haematological, birth outcomes and at 6-week post-partum to ascertain the health status of the babies. Parasitological efficacy (PE) by days 28 and 42 were co-primary outcomes. Analysis was per-protocol (PP) and modified intention-to-treat (ITT). Non-inferiority was declared if the two-sided 95% confidence interval for PE at the endpoints excluded 5% lower efficacy for DHA-PPQ. Secondary outcomes were assessed for superiority.
   RESULTS In PP analysis, PE was 91.6% for DHA-PPQ and 89.3% for ASAQ by day 28 and 89.0% and 86.5%, respectively, by day 42. DHA-PPQ was non-inferior to ASAQ with respect to uncorrected PE [adjusted difference by day 28 (DHA-PPQ-ASAQ); 3.5% (95% CI: -1.5, 8.5); and day 42: 3.9% (95% CI: -2.7, 10.4)]. ITT analysis gave similar results. PCR to distinguish recrudescence and reinfection was unsuccessful. DHA-PPQ recipients had fewer adverse events of vomiting, dizziness, and general weakness compared to ASAQ. Both drugs were well-tolerated, and there was no excess of adverse birth outcomes.
   CONCLUSION DHA-PPQ was non-inferior to ASAQ for treatment of malaria infection during pregnancy. No safety concerns were identified. Our findings contribute to growing evidence that DHA-PPQ is useful for control of malaria in pregnancy.

TI Submicroscopic malaria infections in pregnant women from six departments
   in Haiti
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB OBJECTIVES To describe the epidemiology of malaria in pregnancy in Haiti.
   METHODS Cross-sectional study among pregnant women in six departments of Haiti. After obtaining informed consent, whole blood samples and demographic surveys were collected to investigate malaria prevalence, anaemia and socio-behavioural risk factors for infection, respectively. A total of 311 pregnant women were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy and a novel, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method (qRT-PCR).
   RESULTS Overall, 1.2% (4/311) of pregnant women were tested positive for malaria infection by both microscopy and RDT. However, using the qRT-PCR, 16.4% (51/311) of pregnant women were positive. The prevalence of malaria infection varied with geographical locations ranging between 0% and 46.4%. Additionally, 53% of pregnant women had some form of anaemia; however, no significant association was found between anaemia and submicroscopic malaria infection. The socio-behavioural risk factors identified to be protective of malaria infection were marital status (P < 0.05) and travel within one month prior to screening (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION This study is the first to document the high prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infections among pregnant women in Haiti and identify social and behavioural risk factors for disease transmission.

TI Human IgG repertoire of malaria antigen-immunized human immune system
   (HIS) mice
SO IMMUNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Humanized mouse models present an important tool for preclinical evaluation of new vaccines and therapeutics. Here we show the human variable repertoire of antibody sequences cloned from a previously described human immune system (HIS) mouse model that possesses functional human CD4 + T cells and B cells, namely HIS-CD4/B mice. We sequenced variable IgG genes from single memory B-cell and plasma-cell sorted from splenocytes or whole blood lymphocytes of HIS-CD4/B mice that were vaccinated with a human plasmodial antigen, a recombinant Plasmodiun falciparun circumsporozoite protein (rPfCSP). We demonstrate that rPfCSP immunization triggers a diverse B-cell IgG repertoire composed of various human VH family genes and distinct V(D)J recombinations that constitute diverse CDR3 sequences similar to humans, although low hypermutated sequences were generated. These results demonstrate the substantial genetic diversity of responding human B cells of HIS-CD4/B mice and their capacity to mount human IgG class-switched antibody response upon vaccination.

SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Antenatal malaria screening with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and treatment only of women with positive RDT findings may potentially prevent low birth weight resulting from malaria. The consequences of subpatent antenatal infections below the detection limit of RDTs are incompletely understood. In Malawi, pregnant women of any gravidity status were tested at each antenatal visit for Plasmodium falciparum, using an RDT and polymerase chain reaction analysis, and were followed until delivery. Associations between antenatal infections and delivery outcomes were assessed with Poisson regression or analysis of variance. Compared with women with no detected antenatal P. falciparum infection, women with positive RDT findings delivered babies with a lower mean birth weight (2960 vs 2867 g; mean difference, -93 g [95% confidence interval {CI}, -27 to -159]; P=.006); this was not observed among women with only subpatent infections (mean birth weight, 3013 g; mean difference, 54 [95% CI, -33-140]; P=.2268). These differences were apparent early in pregnancy, during the second trimester: compared with uninfected women, women with positive RDT findings delivered babies with a lower mean birth weight (mean difference, -94 g [95% CI, -31 to -156]; P=.003), but women with subpatent infections did not (mean difference, 36 g [95% CI, -49-122]; P=.409). Subpatent antenatal P. falciparum infections were not associated with adverse delivery outcomes. The association of patent infections at enrollment with low birth weight suggests the importance of preventing P. falciparum infection early in pregnancy.

TI Host attraction and biting behaviour of Anopheles mosquitoes in South
   Halmahera, Indonesia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Indonesia is home to a variety of malaria vectors whose specific bionomic traits remain largely uncharacterized. Species-specific behaviours, such as host feeding preferences, impact the dynamics of malaria transmission and the effectiveness of vector control interventions.
   Methods: To examine species-specific host attraction and feeding behaviours, a Latin square design was used to compare Anopheles mosquitoes attracted to human, cow, and goat-baited tents. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected hourly from the inside walls of each baited tent. Species were morphologically and then molecularly identified using rDNA ITS2 sequences. The head and thorax of individual specimens were analysed for Plasmodium DNA using PCR. Bloodmeals were identified using a multiplex PCR.
   Results: A total of 1024, 137, and 74 Anopheles were collected over 12 nights in cow, goat, and human-baited tents, respectively. The species were identified as Anopheles kochi, Anopheles farauti s.s., Anopheles hackeri, Anopheles hinesorum, Anopheles indefinitus, Anopheles punctulatus, Anopheles tessellatus, Anopheles vagus, and Anopheles vanus, many of which are known to transmit human malaria. Molecular analysis of blood meals revealed a high level of feeding on multiple host species in a single night. Anopheles kochi, An. indefinitus, and An. vanus were infected with Plasmodium vivax at rates comparable to primary malaria vectors.
   Conclusions: The species distributions of Anopheles mosquitoes attracted to human, goat, and cow hosts were similar. Eight of nine sporozoite positive samples were captured with animal-baited traps, indicating that even predominantly zoophilic mosquitoes may be contributing to malaria transmission. Multiple host feeding and flexibility in blood feeding behaviour have important implications for malaria transmission, malaria control, and the effectiveness of intervention and monitoring methods, particularly those that target human-feeding vectors.

TI Substantial asymptomatic submicroscopic Plasmodium carriage during dry
   season in low transmission areas in Senegal: Implications for malaria
   control and elimination
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   In the progress towards malaria elimination, the accurate diagnosis of low-density asymptomatic infections is critical. Low-density asymptomatic submicroscopic malaria infections may act as silent reservoirs that maintain low-level residual malaria transmission in the community. Light microscopy, the gold standard in malaria diagnosis lacks the sensitivity to detect low-level parasitaemia. In this study, the presence and prevalence of submicroscopic Plasmodium carriage were investigated to estimate the parasites reservoir among asymptomatic individuals living in low transmission areas in Dielmo and Ndiop, Senegal during the dry season.
   Methods
   A total of 2,037 blood samples were collected during cross-sectional surveys prior the malaria transmission season in July 2013 (N = 612), June 2014 (N = 723) and June 2015 (N = 702) from asymptomatic individuals living in Dielmo and Ndiop, Senegal. Samples were used to determine the prevalence of submicroscopic Plasmodium carriage by real time PCR (qPCR) in comparison to microscopy considered as gold standard.
   Results
   The prevalence of submicroscopic Plasmodium carriage was 3.75% (23/612), 12.44% (90/723) and 6.41% (45/702) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. No Plasmodium carriage was detected by microscopy in 2013 while microscopy-based prevalence of Plasmodium carriage accounted for only 0.27% (2/723) and 0.14% (1/702) in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum accounted for the majority of submicroscopic infections and represented 86.95% (20/23), 81.11% (73/90) and 95.55 (43/45) of infections in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.
   Conclusion
   Low-density submicroscopic asymptomatic Plasmodium carriage is common in the study areas during the dry season indicating that traditional measures are insufficient to assess the scale of parasite reservoir when transmission reaches very low level. Control and elimination strategies may wish to consider using molecular methods to identify parasites carriers to guide Mass screening and Treatment strategies.

TI Comparison of anti-malarial drugs efficacy in the treatment of
   uncomplicated malaria in African children and adults using network
   meta-analysis
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and novel drug combinations are available and used in African countries to treat uncomplicated malaria. Network meta-analysis methods are rarely and poorly applied for the comparison of their efficacies. This method was applied on a set of randomized controlled trials to illustrate its usefulness.
   Methods: A literature review available in Pubmed was conducted in July 2016. Eligible studies, conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, published between 2002 and 2016, focused on randomized controlled trials of at least two artemisinin-based combinations to treat uncomplicated malaria in children and adults. Agglomerate data were: the number of PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28, used as the primary enDHAPoint in all interventions, the number of participants and the list of treatments. A Bayesian random effect meta-analysis using a binary outcome was the method to compare the efficacy. Ranking measure was used to obtain a hierarchy of the competing interventions.
   Results: In total, 76 articles were included; 13 treatment regimens were involved and tested in 36,001 patients. Using artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the common comparator for the entire network, 12 relative treatment effects were estimated and indirect comparisons were obtained. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) was shown to be more effective than AL (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; 95% CI 1.30-2.82; 19,163 patients), ASAQ (OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.10-2.64; 14,433 patients), and amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQSP): OR = 2.20; 95% CI 1.21-3.96; 8863 patients. Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) was comparable to AL (OR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.84-1.45; 21,235 patients). No significant difference was found between artesunate and mefloquine (ASMQ) and AL (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 0.52-2.8; 13,824 participants). According to treatment ranking, among the WHO-recommended ACT medicines, DHAP was shown to be the most efficacious.
   Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, this study demonstrated the superiority of DHAP among currently recommended artemisinin-based combinations. The application of the methods described here may be helpful to gain better understanding of treatment efficacy and improve future decisions. However, more data are needed to allow robust conclusions about the results in comparison with novel drugs. Further surveillance of the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs and clinical trials are needed to closely follow the evolution of the epidemiology of drug-resistant malaria in Africa.

TI Micro-heterogeneity of malaria transmission in the Peruvian Amazon: a
   baseline assessment underlying a population-based cohort study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Understanding the dynamics of malaria transmission in diverse endemic settings is key for designing and implementing locally adapted and sustainable control and elimination strategies. A parasitological and epidemiological survey was conducted in September-October 2012, as a baseline underlying a 3-year population-based longitudinal cohort study. The aim was to characterize malaria transmission patterns in two contrasting ecological rural sites in the Peruvian Amazon, Lupuna (LUP), a riverine environment, and Cahuide (CAH), associated with road-linked deforestation.
   Methods: After a full population census, 1941 individuals 3 years and older (829 in LUP, 1112 in CAH) were interviewed, clinically examined and had a blood sample taken for the detection of malaria parasites by microscopy and PCR. Species-specific parasite prevalence was estimated overall and by site. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed risk factors for parasite infection by PCR, while SaTScan detected spatial clusters of PCR-positive individuals within each site. In addition, data from routine malaria surveillance in the period 2009-2012 were obtained.
   Results: Parasite prevalence by PCR was higher in CAH than in LUP for Plasmodium vivax (6.2% vs. 3.9%) and for Plasmodium falciparum (2.6% vs. 1.2%). Among PCR-confirmed infections, asymptomatic (Asy) parasite carriers were always more common than symptomatic (Sy) infections for P. vivax (Asy/Sy ratio: 2/1 in LUP and 3.7/1 in CAH) and for P. falciparum (Asy/Sy ratio: 1.3/1 in LUP and 4/1 in CAH). Sub-patent (Spat) infections also predominated over patent (Pat) infections for both species: P. vivax (Spat/Pat ratio: 2.8/1 in LUP and 3.7/1 in CAH) and P. falciparum malaria (Spat/Pat ratio: 1.9/1 in LUP and 26/0 in CAH). For CAH, age, gender and living in a household without electricity were significantly associated with P. vivax infection, while only age and living in a household with electricity was associated with P. falciparum infection. For LUP, only household overcrowding was associated with P. falciparum infection. The spatial analysis only identified well-defined clusters of P. vivax and P. falciparum infected individuals in CAH. Reported malaria incidence indicated that malaria transmission has long occurred in LUP with primarily seasonal patterns, and confirmed a malaria outbreak in CAH since May 2012.
   Conclusions: This parasitological and epidemiological baseline assessment demonstrates that malaria transmission and parasite prevalence is heterogeneous in the Peruvian Amazon, and influenced by local socio-demographics and ecological contexts. Riverine and road construction/deforestation contexts must be taken into account in order to carry out effective anti-malaria control and elimination efforts.

TI Additional burden of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria infections
   during low transmission season in forested tribal villages in
   Chhattisgarh, India
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The burden of sub-patent malaria is difficult to recognize in low endemic areas due to limitation of diagnostic tools, and techniques. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular based technique, is one of the key methods for detection of low parasite density infections. The study objective was to assess the additional burden of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria infection among tribal populations inhabiting three endemic villages in Keshkal sub-district, Chhattisgarh, India. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in March-June 2016, during the low transmission season, to measure and compare prevalence of malaria infection using three diagnostics: rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and nested-PCR.
   Results: Out of 437 individuals enrolled in the study, 103 (23.6%) were malaria positive by PCR and/or microscopy of whom 89.3% were Plasmodium falciparum cases, 77.7% were afebrile and 35.9% had sub-patent infections.
   Conclusions: A substantial number of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria infections were identified in the survey. Hence, strategies for identifying and reducing the hidden burden of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections should focus on forest rural tribal areas using more sensitive molecular diagnostic methods to curtail malaria transmission.

TI Prevalence of polymorphisms in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sickle
   haemoglobin and nitric oxide synthase genes and their relationship with
   incidence of uncomplicated malaria in Iganga, Uganda
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Host genetics play an important role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria susceptibility. However, information on host genetic factors and their relationships with malaria in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda is limited. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of selected host genetic markers and their relationship to malaria incidence in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study, 423 children aged below 9 years were recruited and their malaria episodes were investigated. Host genetic polymorphisms were assessed by PCR-RFLP, haemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Using a multivariate negative binomial regression model, estimates of the impact of human genetic polymorphisms on malaria incidence were performed. In all statistical tests, a P value of < 0.05 was considered as significant.
   Results: The prevalences of sickle cell haemoglobin trait, G6PD c. 202 G > A (rs 1050828) and NOS2 -954 G > C (rs 1800482) variants were 26.6, 22.7 and 17.3%, respectively. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482) heterozygosity was associated with lower incidence of malaria in all age groups {Adjusted incident rates ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95% CI [0.386-0.887]; P = 0.012)}. About 4% of study subjects had co-existence of sickle cell Hb trait and G6PD deficiency. Sickle cell Hb heterozygotes (Hb AS) aged less than 1 year experienced significantly more malaria episodes annually than children with normal haemoglobin (Hb AA) {aIRR = 1.98; 95% CI [1.240-3.175]; P = 0.004}. There was no significant influence of the sickle cell trait on malaria incidence among older children of 1-9 years.
   Conclusions: Mutation (NOS2 -954 G > C; rs 1800482) of nitric oxide synthase 2 gene promoter was associated with a lower incidence of acute malaria. The normal haemoglobin (wild genotype; HbAA) was associated with reduced malaria incidence rates during the first year of life. More understanding of the interplay between host genetics and malaria susceptibility is required.

TI Polymorphisms of Plasmodium falciparum k13-propeller gene among migrant
   workers returning to Henan Province, China from Africa
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Henan Province has been in the malaria elimination stage, with all reports of the disease being imported since 2012 and over 90% coming from Africa. Surveillance and population studies are essential for the early detection and subsequent prevention of the spread of drug resistance. The K13-propeller gene was recently identified as a proposed molecular marker of artemisinin (ART) resistance. In this study, we detected mutations of the K13-propeller gene in samples taken from imported malaria cases in Henan Province from 2012 to 2015.
   Methods: There were 483 samples that were obtained from Plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria migrant workers who returned to Henan Province from Africa between 2012 and 2015. The single nucleotide polymorphisms in the K13-propeller gene were assessed by nested PCR with DNA sequencing. Frequency and geographic difference of K13-propeller gene mutant types were analyzed.
   Results: Of 483 patients, 476 were cured and 7 died. There were no K13-propeller mutations in the blood samples from the 7 patients who died, but there were 23 different genotypes of the K13-propeller that were observed in 24 (4.97%) of the samples. C580Y, which was the predominant one in the resistance of ART, was not detected in the samples, but R539T and P574L which have also been associated with ART resistance, were observed in two samples from Angola and Equatorial Guinea. No mutations were detected in 11 samples from North Africa. The frequency of the K13-propeller was 6.50% (8/123) in Central Africa, followed by East Africa (1/19, 5.26%), West Africa (9/198, 4.55%) and South Africa (6/132, 4.55%). There was no significant difference among these four areas (P = 0.795).
   Conclusion: R539T and P574L were found in migrant workers who traveled from Africa to Henan Province, although the frequency of the K13-propeller mutants was low. These data may enrich the molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance and will be helpful for developing and updating the antimalarial policy in Henan Province.

TI Identification of Plasmodium spp. in Neotropical primates of Maranhense
   Amazon in Northeast Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the Brazilian Amazon region, malaria caused by Plasmodium malariae is considered to be a zoonosis because of cross-transfer of the parasite between humans and Neotropical primates. To contribute information on this issue, we investigated occurrences of natural infection with Plasmodium sp. among Neotropical primates in the Maranhense Amazon (Amazon region of the state of Maranhao), in the northeastern region of Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 161 Neotropical primates of six species that were caught in an environmental reserve (Sitio Aguahy) and from captive primates (CETAS-Wildlife Screening Center, municipality of Sao Luis), in Maranhao. Plasmodium sp. was diagnosed based on light microscopy, PCR, qPCR and LAMP for amplification of the 18S rRNA gene. Serum samples were also assayed by means of indirect immunofluorescence for IgG antibodies against P. malariae/P. brasilianum, P. falciparum and P. berghei. Parasites were detected through light microscopy on five slides from captive primates (four Sapajus spp. and one Callithrix jacchus). In the molecular tests, 34.16% (55/161) and 29.81% (48/161) of the animals sampled were positive in the qPCR and PCR assays, respectively. In the PCR, 47/48 animals were positive for P. malariae/P. brasilianum; of these, eight were free-living primates and 39 from CETAS, Sao Luis. One sample showed a band in the genus-specific reaction, but not in the second PCR reaction. Anti-P. malariae/P. brasilianum IgG antibodies were detected in four serum samples from Sapajus spp. in captivity. In this study, circulation of P. malariae/P. brasilianum in Neotropical primates was confirmed, with low levels of parasitemia and low levels of antibodies. The importance of these animals as reservoirs of human malaria in the region studied is still unknown. This scenario has an impact on control and elimination of malaria in this region.

TI Knockdown of the Plasmodium falciparum SURFIN4.1 antigen leads to an
   increase of its cognate transcript
SO PLOS ONE
AB The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains the surf gene family which encodes large transmembrane proteins of unknown function. While some surf alleles appear to be expressed in sexual stages, others occur in asexual blood stage forms and may be associated to virulence-associated processes and undergo transcriptional switching. We accessed the transcription of surf genes along multiple invasions by real time PCR. Based on the observation of persistent expression of gene surf4.1, we created a parasite line which expresses a conditionally destabilized SURFIN4.1 protein. Upon destabilization of the protein, no interference of parasite growth or morphological changes were detected. However, we observed a strong increase in the transcript quantities of surf4.1 and sometimes of other surf genes in knocked-down parasites. While this effect was reversible when SURFIN4.1 was stabilized again after a few days of destabilization, longer destabilization periods resulted in a transcriptional switch away from surf4.1. When we tested if a longer transcript half-life was responsible for increased transcript detection in SURFIN4.1 knocked-down parasites, no alteration was found compared to control parasite lines. This suggests a specific feedback of the expressed SURFIN protein to its transcript pointing to a novel type of regulation, inedited in Plasmodium.

TI Life-span of in vitro differentiated Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The sexual stages (gametocytes) of Plasmodium falciparum do not directly contribute to the pathology of malaria but are essential for transmission of the parasite from the human host to the mosquito. Mature gametocytes circulate in infected human blood for several days and their circulation time has been modelled mathematically from data of previous in vivo studies. This is the first time that longevity of gametocytes is studied experimentally in vitro.
   Methods: The in vitro longevity of P. falciparum gametocytes of 1 clinical isolate and 2 laboratory strains was assessed by three different methods: microscopy, flow cytometry and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Additionally, the rate of gametocytogenesis of the used P. falciparum strains was compared.
   Results: The maximum in vitro lifespan of P. falciparum gametocytes reached almost 2 months (49 days by flow cytometry, 46 days by microscopy, and at least 52 days by RT-qPCR) from the starting day of gametocyte culture to death of last parasite in the tested strains with an average 50% survival rate of 6.5, 2.6 and 3.5 days, respectively. Peak gametocytaemia was observed on average 19 days after initiation of gametocyte culture followed by a steady decline due to natural decay of the parasites. The rate of gametocytogenesis was highest in the NF54 strain.
   Conclusions: Plasmodium falciparum mature gametocytes can survive up to 16-32 days (at least 14 days for mature male gametocytes) in vitro in absence of the influence of host factors. This confirms experimentally a previous modelling estimate that used molecular tools for gametocyte detection in treated patients. The survival time might reflect the time the parasite can be transmitted to the mosquito after clearance of asexual parasites. These results underline the importance of efficient transmission blocking agents in the fight against malaria.

TI A Molecular Assay to Quantify Male and Female Plasmodium falciparum
   Gametocytes: Results From 2 Randomized Controlled Trials Using
   Primaquine for Gametocyte Clearance
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Single low-dose primaquine (PQ) reduces Plasmodium falciparum infectivity before it impacts gametocyte density. Here, we examined the effect of PQ on gametocyte sex ratio as a possible explanation for this early sterilizing effect.
   Methods. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were developed to quantify female gametocytes (targeting Pfs25 messenger RNA [mRNA]) and male gametocytes (targeting Pf3D7_1469900 mRNA) in 2 randomized trials in Kenya and Mali, comparing dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) alone to DP with PQ. Gametocyte sex ratio was examined in relation to time since treatment and infectivity to mosquitoes.
   Results. In Kenya, the median proportion of male gametocytes was 0.33 at baseline. Seven days after treatment, gametocyte density was significantly reduced in the DP-PQ arm relative to the DP arm (females: 0.05% [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.0-0.7%] of baseline; males: 3.4% [IQR, 0.4%-32.9%] of baseline; P <.001). Twenty-four hours after treatment, gametocyte sex ratio became male-biased and was not significantly different between the DP and DP-PQ groups. In Mali, there was no significant difference in sex ratio between the DP and DP-PQ groups (> 0.125 mg/kg) 48 hours after treatment, and gametocyte sex ratio was not associated with mosquito infection rates.
   Conclusions. The early sterilizing effects of PQ may not be explained by the preferential clearance of male gametocytes and may be due to an effect on gametocyte fitness.

TI Molecular analysis demonstrates high prevalence of chloroquine
   resistance but no evidence of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium
   falciparum in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin resistance is present in the Greater Mekong region and poses a significant threat for current anti-malarial treatment guidelines in Bangladesh. The aim of this molecular study was to assess the current status of drug resistance in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh near the Myanmar border.
   Methods: Samples were obtained from patients enrolled into a Clinical Trial (NCT02389374) conducted in Alikadam, Bandarban between August 2014 and January 2015. Plasmodium falciparum infections were confirmed by PCR and all P. falciparum positive isolates genotyped for the pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y markers. The propeller region of the kelch 13 (k13) gene was sequenced from isolates from patients with delayed parasite clearance.
   Results: In total, 130 P. falciparum isolates were available for analysis. The pfcrt mutation K76T, associated with chloroquine resistance was found in 81.5% (106/130) of cases and the pfmdr1 mutation N86Y in 13.9% (18/130) cases. No single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the k13 propeller region.
   Conclusion: This study provides molecular evidence for the ongoing presence of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum in Bangladesh, but no evidence of mutations in the k13 propeller domain associated with artemisinin resistance. Monitoring for artemisinin susceptibility in Bangladesh is needed to ensure early detection and containment emerging anti-malarial resistance.

TI Cryptic Plasmodium ovale concurrent with mixed Plasmodium falciparum and
   Plasmodium malariae infection in two children from Central African
   Republic
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Since several malaria parasite species are usually present in a particular area, co-infections with more than one species of Plasmodium are more likely to occur in humans infected in these areas. In many mixed infections, parasite densities of the cryptic species may be low and often not recognized in clinical practice.
   Case presentation: Two children (3 and 6 years old) adopted recently from Central African Republic were admitted to hospital because of intermittent fever. Thin blood smears stained with Giemsa showed Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae co-infection for both children at admission. They were both treated with atovaquone-proguanil combination for 3 days. At day 7, both thin blood smears examination remained negative but at day 28, thin blood smear was positive for P. malariae trophozoites and for Plasmodium ovale for the girl and her brother, respectively. Samples collected at day 1 and day 28 were submitted to real-time PCR showing the presence of the three parasite species (P. falciparum, P malariae and P. ovale) in admission blood samples from the two children and only P. ovale at day 28.
   Conclusions: Twenty-eight days follow-up after treatment led to detection of a third parasite species in the blood of these two patients suggesting covert co-infection and a delayed appearance of one cryptic species following treatment. Concurrently infecting malaria species could be mutually suppressive, with P. falciparum tending to dominate other species. These observations provide more evidence that recommendations for treatment of imported malaria should take into account the risk of concurrent or cryptic infection with Plasmodium species. Clinicians and biologists should be aware of the underestimated frequency of mixed infections with cryptic species and of the importance of patient follow-up at day 28. Future guidelines should shed more light on the treatment of mixed infection and on the interest of using artemisinin-based combinations for falciparum and non-falciparum species.

TI A new method for sequencing the hypervariable Plasmodium falciparum gene
   var2csa from clinical samples
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: VAR2CSA, a member of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, mediates the binding of P.falciparum-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A, a surface-associated molecule expressed in placental cells, and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of placental malaria. VAR2CSA is a target of naturally acquired immunity and, as such, is a leading vaccine candidate against placental malaria. This protein is very polymorphic and technically challenging to sequence. Published var2csa sequences, mostly limited to specific domains, have been generated through the sequencing of cloned PCR amplicons using capillary electrophoresis, a method that is both time consuming and costly, and that performs poorly when applied to clinical samples that are commonly polyclonal. A next-generation sequencing platform, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), offers an alternative approach to overcome these issues.
   Methods: PCR primers were designed that target a 5 kb segment in the 5' end of var2csa and the resulting amplicons were sequenced using PacBio sequencing. The primers were optimized using two laboratory strains and were validated on DNA from 43 clinical samples, extracted from dried blood spots on filter paper or from cryopreserved P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Sequence reads were assembled using the SMRT-analysis ConsensusTools module.
   Results: Here, a PacBio sequencing-based approach for recovering a segment encoding the majority of VAR2CSA's extracellular region is described; this segment includes the totality of the first four domains in the 5' end of var2csa (similar to 5 kb), from clinical malaria samples. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated, showing a high success rate from cryopreserved samples and more limited success from dried blood spots stored at room temperature, and characterized the genetic variation of the var2csa locus.
   Conclusions: This method will facilitate a detailed analysis of var2csa genetic variation and can be adapted to sequence other hypervariable P. falciparum genes.

TI Computer Vision Malaria Diagnostic Systems-Progress and Prospects
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Accurate malaria diagnosis is critical to prevent malaria fatalities, curb overuse of antimalarial drugs, and promote appropriate management of other causes of fever. While several diagnostic tests exist, the need for a rapid and highly accurate malaria assay remains. Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are the main diagnostic modalities available, yet they can demonstrate poor performance and accuracy. Automated microscopy platforms have the potential to significantly improve and standardize malaria diagnosis. Based on image recognition and machine learning algorithms, these systems maintain the benefits of light microscopy and provide improvements such as quicker scanning time, greater scanning area, and increased consistency brought by automation. While these applications have been in development for over a decade, recently several commercial platforms have emerged. In this review, we discuss the most advanced computer vision malaria diagnostic technologies and investigate several of their features which are central to field use. Additionally, we discuss the technological and policy barriers to implementing these technologies in low-resource settings world-wide.

TI Naturally acquired antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum describes
   heterogeneity in transmission on islands in Lake Victoria
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As markers of exposure anti-malaria antibody responses can help characterise heterogeneity in malaria transmission. In the present study antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum AMA-1, MSP-1(19) and CSP were measured with the aim to describe transmission patterns in meso-endemic settings in Lake Victoria. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Lake Victoria in January and August 2012. The study area comprised of three settings: mainland (Ungoye), large island (Mfangano) and small islands (Takawiri, Kibuogi, Ngodhe). Individuals provided a finger-blood sample to assess malaria infection by microscopy and PCR. Antibody response to P. falciparum was determined in 4,112 individuals by ELISA using eluted dried blood from filter paper. The overall seroprevalence was 64.0% for AMA-1, 39.5% for MSP-1(19), and 12.9% for CSP. Between settings, seroprevalences for merozoite antigens were similar between Ungoye and Mfangano, but higher when compared to the small islands. For AMA-1, the seroconversion rates (SCRs) ranged from 0.121 (Ngodhe) to 0.202 (Ungoye), and were strongly correlated to parasite prevalence. We observed heterogeneity in serological indices across study sites in Lake Victoria. These data suggest that AMA-1 and MSP-1(19) sero-epidemiological analysis may provide further evidence in assessing variation in malaria exposure and evaluating malaria control efforts in high endemic area.

TI Natural antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum MSP3 and GLURP(R0)
   antigens are associated with low parasite densities in malaria patients
   living in the Central Region of Ghana
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection (MOI) are parasite features that have been suggested to influence the acquisition of protective immunity against malaria. This study sought to assess the relationship between MOI and parasite density (PD) in malaria patients living in the Central Region of Ghana and to determine whether naturally occurring antibody levels against P. falciparum GLURP (PF3D7_1035300) and MSP3 (PF3D7_1035400) antigens are associated with decreased parasite load.
   Methods: Dried filter paper blood blots were obtained from children and adults diagnosed with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Microscopy was used to estimate P. falciparum parasite density and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the polymorphic regions of msp1 (PF3D7_0930300) and msp2 (PF3D7_0206800) was used for parasite genotyping and MOI determination. ELISA was used to measure the serum IgG concentration of R0 fragment of GLURP (GLURP(R0)) and MSP3 antibodies.
   Results: All 115 samples were positive for P. falciparum by PCR using either the msp1 or msp2 genotyping primer sets. The most prevalent msp1 and msp2 alleles were KI and 3D7, respectively. The geometric mean (GM) for MOI determined by both msp1 and msp2 genotyping was 1.3 for the entire population and was generally higher in children than in adults. Seropositivity was estimated at 67 and 63% for GLURP(R0) and MSP3 antibodies, respectively, and antibody titers were negatively correlated with parasite density.
   Conclusions: The negative correlation between naturally occurring GLURP(R0) and MSP3 antibody levels and parasite density observed in this study suggest that augmenting the antibody response with the GMZ2 vaccine could enhance protection in the Central Region of Ghana.

TI Association of TLR variants with susceptibility to Plasmodium vivax
   malaria and parasitemia in the Amazon region of Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Plasmodium vivax malaria (Pv-malaria) is still considered a neglected disease despite an alarming number of individuals being infected annually. Malaria pathogenesis occurs with the onset of the vector-parasite-host interaction through the binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and receptors of innate immunity, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). The triggering of the signaling cascade produces an elevated inflammatory response. Genetic polymorphisms in TLRs are involved in susceptibility or resistance to infection, and the identification of genes involved with Pv-malaria response is important to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and may contribute to the formulation of control and elimination tools.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A retrospective case-control study was conducted in an intense transmission area of Pvmalaria in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) in different TLRs, TIRAP, and CD14 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 325 patients infected with P. vivax and 274 healthy individuals without malaria history in the prior 12 months from the same endemic area. Parasite load was determined by qPCR. Simple and multiple logistic/linear regressions were performed to investigate association between the polymorphisms and the occurrence of Pvmalaria and parasitemia. The C/T (TLR5 R392StopCodon) and T/T (TLR9 - 1486C/T) genotypes appear to be risk factors for infection by P. vivax (TLR5: C/C vs. C/T [ OR: 2.116, 95% CI: 1.054 - 4.452, p = 0.031]; TLR9: C/C vs. T/T [ OR: 1.919, 95% CI: 1.159 - 3.177, p = 0.010]; respectively). Fever (COEF = 7599.46, 95% CI = 3063.80 - 12135.12, p = 0.001) and the C/C genotype of TLR9 - 1237C/T (COEF = 17006.63, 95% CI = 3472.83 - 30540.44, p = 0.014) were independently associated with increased parasitemia in patients with Pv-malaria.
   Conclusions
   Variants of TLRs may predispose individuals to infection by P. vivax. The TLR5 R392StopCodon and TLR9 - 1486C/T variants are associated with susceptibility to Pv-malaria. Furthermore, the TLR9 variant - 1237C/C correlates with high parasitemia.

TI Polymorphisms in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes after five years of artemisinin
   combination therapy (ACT) implementation from urban Kolkata, India
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Background: In India, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is now in use as a partner drug of ACT (AS + SP) to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2010. Declined trend of AS + SP efficacy has been reported from northeastern states of the country. It is not possible to determine the efficacy of SP alone from any study with ACT. So, this work was designed to study the pattern of polymorphisms in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes to predict the SP resistance status among parasite population of urban Kolkata after five years of ACT implementation.
   Methods: A total of 125 P. falciparum positive patients were enrolled in the study during December 2014 to July 2016 and treated with AS + SP. Parasitic DNA was isolated and subjected to sequencing of pfdhfr and pfdhps genes directly from purified PCR products.
   Results: Genotyping of both the genes was successfully done in 113 isolates. In pfdhfr, 94.69% (107/113) isolates showed mutations at codon 59 and 108. A double mutant genotype ANRNI was mostly prevalent (107/113, 94.69%), while wild-type genotype ANCSI was found only in 5.3% (6/113) isolates. In pfdhps, mutations were recorded at codon 436 and 437 in 65.49% (74/113) and 23.01% (26/113) isolates, respectively. In combined pfdhfr-pfdhps genes, triple mutant ANRNI-FAKAA was most prevalent (45/113, 39.82%) followed by double mutant ANRNI-SAKAA (37/113, 32.74%) and quadruple mutant ANRNI-FGKAA (24/113, 21.24%).
   Conclusion: SP resistance hallmark mutations i.e., quadruple (AIRNI-SAEAA) or quintuple (AIRNI-SGEAA) genotype in pfdhfr and pfdhps was absent which indicates that SP components of used ACT is still effective in the study area. It is also evident by the clinical response of AS + SP. Monitoring the efficacy of this combination (both by therapeutic and molecular marker study) at a regular interval is highly suggested to record any development of SP resistance in near future.

AB Proteases are crucial enzymes with varying roles in living organisms. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the role of proteases has been deciphered mainly in the asexual blood stages and shown to represent promising drug targets. However, little is known about their functions in the sexual blood stages, which are important for transmission of the disease from the human to the mosquito vector. Determination of their stage-specific expression during the malaria life-cycle is crucial for the effective design of multi-stage anti-malaria drugs aimed at eradicating the disease. In this study, we screened the P. falciparum genome database for putative proteases and determined the transcript and protein expression profiles of selected proteases in the plasmodial blood stages using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Database mining identified a total of 148 putative proteases, out of which 18 were demonstrated to be expressed in the blood stages on the transcript level; for 12 of these proteins synthesis was confirmed. While three of these proteases exhibit gametocyte-specific expression, two are restricted to the asexual blood stages and seven are found in both stages, making them interesting multi-stage drug targets.

TI RANTES levels as a determinant of falciparum malaria severity or
   recovery
SO PARASITE IMMUNOLOGY
AB The study explored the role of differential RANTES concentrations, its receptor CCR5 expression and resulting immunomodulation in the pathogenesis and/or recovery from falciparum malaria. The study population included cases of uncomplicated malaria (UC-M, N=128, enrolled on follow-up basis), severe malaria (SM, N=25), and healthy controls (N=112). Serum RANTES and TNF- levels were evaluated by ELISA. Monocyte levels and activation profile were studied by flow cytometry. Differential mRNA expression profile was studied by real-time PCR. Blood parasite count was evaluated by registered pathologists. RANTES concentration was significantly downregulated in SM cases compared to UC-M (P=.046) and controls (P<.001). Expression of monocyte marker mCD14, activation markers CCR5 and CD40, and downstream effector cytokine TNF- was significantly higher in malaria cases compared to controls, in SM cases compared to UC-M. TNF- expression correlated positively with CD40 and CCR5 expressions. Follow-up-based analysis showed that RANTES concentrations increased on recovery compared to baseline in UC-M cases (P=.106) and inversely correlated with malaria parasite load, mCD14, CCR5 and CD40, and TNF- expressions. These findings suggest an important association of RANTES concentrations in Plasmodium falciparum malaria disease pathogenesis, as well as recovery, mediated through differential modulation and regulated activation of monocytes and cytokine TNF-.

TI Plasmodium falciparum GFP-E-NTPDase expression at the intraerythrocytic
   stages and its inhibition blocks the development of the human malaria
   parasite
SO PURINERGIC SIGNALLING
AB Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most dangerous form of malaria in humans. It has been reported that the P. falciparum genome encodes for a single ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase), an enzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular tri- and di-phosphate nucleotides. The E-NTPDases are known for participating in invasion and as a virulence factor in many pathogenic protozoa. Despite its presence in the parasite genome, currently, no information exists about the activity of this predicted protein. Here, we show for the first time that P. falciparum E-NTPDase is relevant for parasite lifecycle as inhibition of this enzyme impairs the development of P. falciparum within red blood cells (RBCs). ATPase activity could be detected in rings, trophozoites, and schizonts, as well as qRT-PCR, confirming that E-NTPDase is expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle. In addition, transfection of a construct which expresses approximately the first 500 bp of an E-NTPDase-GFP chimera shows that E-NTPDase co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the early stages and with the digestive vacuole (DV) in the late stages of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cycle.

TI Proviral Features of Human T Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 in Carriers with
   Indeterminate Western Blot Analysis Results
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Western blotting (WB) for human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is performed to confirm anti-HTLV-1 antibodies detected at the initial screening of blood donors and in pregnant women. However, the frequent occurrence of indeterminate results is a problem with this test. We therefore assessed the cause of indeterminate WB results by analyzing HTLV-1 provirus genomic sequences. A quantitative PCR assay measuring HTLV-1 provirus in WB-indeterminate samples revealed that the median proviral load was approximately 100-fold lower than that of WB-positive samples (0.01 versus 0.71 copy/100 cells). Phylogenic analysis of the complete HTLV-1 genomes of WB-indeterminate samples did not identify any specific phylogenetic groups. When we analyzed the nucleotide changes in 19 HTLV-1 isolates from WB-indeterminate samples, we identified 135 single nucleotide substitutions, composed of four types, G to A (29%), C to T (19%), T to C (19%), and A to G (16%). In the most frequent G-to-A substitution, 64% occurred at GG dinucleotides, indicating that APOBEC3G is responsible for mutagenesis in WB-indeterminate samples. Moreover, interestingly, five WB-indeterminate isolates had nonsense mutations in Pol and/or Tax, Env, p12, and p30. These findings suggest that WB-indeterminate carriers have low production of viral antigens because of a combination of a low proviral load and mutations in the provirus, which may interfere with host recognition of HTLV-1 antigens.

TI Analysis of polymorphisms and selective pressures on ama1 gene in
   Plasmodium knowlesi isolates from Sabah, Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF GENETICS
AB The apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) of Plasmodium spp. is a merozoite surface antigen that is essential for the recognition and invasion of erythrocytes. Polymorphisms occurring in this surface antigen will cause major obstacles in developing effective malaria vaccines based on AMA-1. The objective of this study was to characterize ama1 gene in Plasmodium knowlesi isolates from Sabah. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from Keningau, Kota Kinabalu and Kudat. The Pkama-1 gene was amplified using nested PCR and subjected to bidirectional sequencing. Analysis of DNA sequence revealed that most of the nucleotide polymorphisms were synonymous and concentrated in domain I of PkAMA-1. Forteen haplotypes were identified based on amino acid variations and haplotype K5 was the most common haplotype. d(N)/d(S) ratios implied that purifying selection was prevalent in Pkama1 gene. Fu and Li's D and F values further provided evidence of negative selection acting on domain II of Pkama1. Low nucleotide diversity was also detected for the Pkama1 sequences, which is similar to reports on Pkama1 from Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. The presence of purifying selection and low nucleotide diversity indicated that domain II of Pkama1 can be used as a target for vaccine development.

TI PCR-RFLP analysis of Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein2c
   gene in field isolates of Iran
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB A family of reticulocyte-binding proteins of Plasmodium vivax (PvRBP) is localised at the apical pole of the merozoites and appears to bind to reticulocytes specifically and has also been involved in identifying host cells. Protein component produced by the Pvrbp2c gene is highly antigenic. The aim of this study was to detect the genetic diversity in the Pvrbp2c gene of Iranian P. vivax field isolates using the polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. A total of 79 P. vivax malaria patients with fever participated in the study. Alu1 and Apo1 restriction enzymes were independently used to identify allelic variants of the Pvrbp2c gene. All of the samples exhibited a single band of about 2 Kb in nested PCR. Among 79 P. vivax field isolates in the RFLP with Apo1 and Alu1 restriction enzymes, 15 and nine patterns were observed, respectively. In total, 24 various patterns were detected from the combined findings of both Alu1 and Apo1 fragments in RFLP. This study revealed that Pvrbp2c has genetic diversity in southeast Iran. Genotyping of Pvrbp2c not only shows the heterogeneity of P. vivax but also provides important information that could be used to control vivax malaria.

TI The Prevalence of P-malariae in Odisha, India
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Odisha, an eastern Indian state, is known to be highly endemic for malaria. The current national malaria control programme uses rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of the cases followed by microscopy for the identification of species. But as per the available literatures and from our own experience it is known that microscopy suffers with underestimation of mixed Plasmodium species infection, especially P. malariae and P. ovale. Since PCR has proven to have more sensitivity and specificity and able to detect multiple infection of Plasmodium species, we have made an attempt to find out the prevalence of species of parasites by PCR and compare the results with light microscopy. During this study 1589 individuals presenting with fever from two malaria endemic blocks namely Badampahar and Ghatgaon were investigated. Amongst them 110 cases were found to be PCR positive while 99 were microscopically positive for malaria. Out of the total PCR positive cases 42 cases (38.2%) had P. falciparum, 35 (31.8%) had P. vivax and 10 (9.1%) had P. malariae mono infections, while 23 (20.9 %) cases had mixed infections. Of the total 23 mixed infections 11(10%) were having P. falciparum plus P. vivax and rest 12 (10.9%) cases were having P. malariae mixed with either P. falciparum and/or P. vivax. However microscopically only 1(1.4%) case was found to have P. malariae mono infection and none of the mixed infections harbor P. malariae. Multiple kind lottery model analysis of PCR positive samples demonstrated that P. malariae is not distributed randomly in population when compared by different age groups, gender and season. The study also has shown that PCR is highly effective in screening the severe and asymptomatic malaria cases than LM. The result of this study warrants newer surveillance strategies for case detection and management by the programme.

TI Asymptomatic plasmodial infection in pregnant women: A global scenario
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES
AB Though asymptomatic plasmodial infection (API) is well known phenomenon and play an important role in different populations and malaria transmission settings, it has received less attention in malaria intervention strategies. This review was aimed to estimate the prevalence of API in pregnant women across the world. The bibliography records relevant to the study were searched on PubMed and Lilacs, till August 15, 2016, without restriction of language. A total of 78 references were identified, of which 29 met the inclusion criteria. The study of the identified reports revealed that the mean prevalence of API in pregnant women was 10.8% (3382/31186), with wide variation among countries and transmission settings. The reports showed that APIs are very common even in low malaria transmission areas, and most of the APIs are due to submicroscopic plasmodial infection (SPI). More sensitive diagnostic tools are required to address API and SPI in such areas. Every malaria endemic region/country should carry out systematic studies for accurate estimation of frequency for both these events (API and SPI) in different populations for planning appropriate intervention measures.

TI Mutational Analysis of Plasmodium vivax dhfr Gene Among Cases in South
   East of Iran
SO JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum have been detected in south east of Iran. Plasmodium vivax has a higher prevalence in this area. Point mutation in P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) gene is the key mechanism of Sulfadoxine and Pyrimethamine (SP) resistance.
   Objectives: This study aimed at investigating pvdhfr mutations and haplotypes in Sistan and Baluchestan endemic province of Iran. Methods: Seventy-five blood samples from Sistan and Baluchistan province of Iran, infected with P. vivax, between years 2013 and 2015, were enrolled in this study. The samples were examined for probable point mutations in pvdhfr gene using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing methods.
   Results: Most of the isolates (59%) had wild type codons at 4 locations of pvdhfr gene. The F57S58T61N117 was the most common haplotype among the mutant cases (24.3%); in these cases, the haplotypes with triple and quadruple mutations in 57, 58, 61, and 117 codons were not identified. In addition, haplotypes with double mutations at location FRTN (7.7%) and FRTT (2.6%) were identified in studied cases.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the presence of mutant pvdhfr haplotypes, which are resistant to the SP is increasing, therefore, performing a molecular surveillance via the PCR method in endemic areas is very important.

TI Molecular characterization of Plasmodium falciparum in Arunachal Pradesh
   from Northeast India based on merozoite surface protein 1 &
   glutamate-rich protein
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB Background & objectives: Northeast (NE) India is one of the high endemic regions for malaria with a preponderance of Plasmodium falciparum, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The P. falciparum parasite of this region showed high polymorphism in drug-resistant molecular biomarkers. However, there is a paucity of information related to merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) and glutamate-rich protein (glurp) which have been extensively studied in various parts of the world. The present study was, therefore, aimed at investigating the genetic diversity of P. falciparum based on msp-1 and glurp in Arunachal Pradesh, a State in NE India.
   Methods: Two hundred and forty nine patients with fever were screened for malaria, of whom 75 were positive for P. falciparum. Blood samples were collected from each microscopically confirmed patient. The DNA was extracted; nested polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to study the genetic diversity of msp-1 (block 2) and glurp.
   Results: The block 2 of msp-1 gene was found to be highly polymorphic, and overall allelic distribution showed that RO33 was the dominant allele (63%), followed by MAD20 (29%) and K1 (8%) alleles. However, an extensive diversity (9 alleles and 4 genotypes) and 6-10 repeat regions exclusively of R2 type were observed in glurp.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The P. falciparum population of NE India was diverse which might be responsible for higher plasticity leading to the survival of the parasite and in turn to the higher endemicity of falciparum malaria of this region.

TI Analysis of Plasmodium vivax Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (PvAMA-1)
   Haplotypes among Iranian Isolates
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR MEDICINE
AB Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1(PvAMA-1) is a surface protein with polymorphic sites. This study was aimed to analyze the polymorphic amino acid residues at PvAMA-1 in different infected age groups. 92 blood samples were collected from the south and southeast of Iran. The DNA coding for the domain I (DI), DII, and partial DIII of this antigen was amplified by Nested-PCR, and sequenced. Nucleotide mutations were found in 49 sites and based on the amino acid sequence, 30 variable sites were detected. Age distribution of malaria cases showed that the majority of the patients were between 10 to 30 years old. The scattering plot haplotypes by age showed an increasing incidence rate with age during childhood, whereas, incidence was the lowest in patients under five years old. Comparison of the polymorphic sites of PvAMA-1 in Iranian isolates with those found in other geographic regions of the world indicated nine common variable positions. In addition, a significant dependence was found between some particular substitutions and age categories. Dependence between particular substitutions and age groups suggests that certain residues in AMA-1 are responsible for clinical attacks in different ages, likely as a result of host immune pressure. The crystal structure of the PvAMA-1 showed that the amino acid substitutions that changed the protein charge were exclusively located in loops and turns where, the interactions with antibodies could occur. These data provide the necessary information for an AMA-1 based malaria vaccine design to be effective across all ages.

TI Semi-high-throughput detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
   vivax oocysts in mosquitoes using bead-beating followed by
   circumsporozoite ELISA and quantitative PCR
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The malaria infection status of mosquitoes is commonly determined by microscopic detection of oocysts on the dissected mosquito midgut. This method is labour-intensive, does not allow processing of large numbers of mosquitoes and can be challenging in terms of objective classification of oocysts. Here, a semi-high-throughput bead-beating ELISA method is proposed for detection of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) followed by confirmation by quantitative PCR (qPCR).
   Methods: Cultured Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes were offered to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes and examined by microscopy. After bead-beating, mosquito homogenate was examined by CSP-ELISA and 18S qPCR. As negative controls, mosquitoes that were offered a heat-inactivated gametocyte blood meal were used. The CSP-ELISA/qPCR methodology was applied to high and low-intensity infections of cultured P. falciparum gametocytes. A similar methodology optimized for P. vivax was used on mosquitoes that were offered blood from Ethiopian donors who were naturally infected with P. vivax.
   Results: There was considerable variation in CSP-ELISA signal and qPCR values in mosquitoes with low oocyst intensities. There was a strong agreement mosquito positivity by CSP-ELISA and by qPCR in mosquitoes that fed on cultured P. falciparum material (agreement 96.9%; kappa = 0.97) and naturally infected P. vivax parasite carriers [agreement 92.4% (kappa = 0.83)].
   Conclusions: The proposed bead-beating CSP-ELISA/qPCR methodology considerably increases throughput for the detection of mosquito infection. qPCR remains necessary to confirm infections in mosquitoes with low CSP-ELISA signal. This methodology may prove particularly useful for studies where very low mosquito infection prevalence is expected and study sites where experience with oocyst detection is limited.

TI Composition of Anopheles mosquitoes, their blood-meal hosts, and
   Plasmodium falciparum infection rates in three islands with disparate
   bed net coverage in Lake Victoria, Kenya
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Small islands serve as potential malaria reservoirs through which new infections might come to the mainland and may be important targets in malaria elimination efforts. This study investigated malaria vector species diversity, blood-meal hosts, Plasmodium infection rates, and long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage on Mageta, Magare and Ngodhe Islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya, a region where extensive vector control is implemented on the mainland.
   Results: From trapping for six consecutive nights per month (November 2012 to March 2015) using CDC light traps, pyrethrum spray catches and backpack aspiration, 1868 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected. Based on their cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and intergenic spacer region PCR and sequencing, Anopheles gambiae s.l. (68.52%), Anopheles coustani (19.81%) and Anopheles funestus s.l. (11.67%) mosquitoes were differentiated. The mean abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes per building per trap was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in Mageta than in Magare and Ngodhe. Mageta was also the most populated island (n = 6487) with low LLIN coverage of 62.35% compared to Ngodhe (n = 484; 88.31%) and Magare (n = 250; 98.59%). Overall, 416 (22.27%) engorged Anopheles mosquitoes were analysed, of which 41 tested positive for Plasmodium falciparum infection by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of 18S rRNA and cytochrome b PCR products. Plasmodium falciparum infection rates were 10.00, 11.76, 0, and 18.75% among blood-fed An. gambiae s.s. (n = 320), Anopheles arabiensis (n = 51), An. funestus s. s. (n = 29), and An. coustani (n = 16), respectively. Based on HRM analysis of vertebrate cytochrome b, 16S rRNA and COI PCR products, humans (72.36%) were the prominent blood-meal hosts of malaria vectors, but 20.91% of blood-meals were from non-human vertebrate hosts.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate high Plasmodium infection rates among the primary malaria vectors An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis, as well as in An. coustani for the first time in the region, and that non-human bloodmeal sources play an important role in their ecology. Further, the higher Anopheles mosquito abundances on the only low LLIN coverage island of Mageta suggests that high LLIN coverage has been effective in reducing malaria vector populations on Magare and Ngodhe Islands.

TI Modest heterologous protection after Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite
   immunization: a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: A highly efficacious vaccine is needed for malaria control and eradication. Immunization with Plasmodium falciparum NF54 parasites under chemoprophylaxis (chemoprophylaxis and sporozoite (CPS)-immunization) induces the most efficient long-lasting protection against a homologous parasite. However, parasite genetic diversity is a major hurdle for protection against heterologous strains.
   Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 39 healthy participants of NF54-CPS immunization by bites of 45 NF54-infected (n = 24 volunteers) or uninfected mosquitoes (placebo; n = 15 volunteers) against a controlled human malaria infection with the homologous NF54 or the genetically distinct NF135. C10 and NF166. C8 clones. Cellular and humoral immune assays were performed as well as genetic characterization of the parasite clones.
   Results: NF54-CPS immunization induced complete protection in 5/5 volunteers against NF54 challenge infection at 14 weeks post-immunization, but sterilely protected only 2/10 and 1/9 volunteers against NF135. C10 and NF166. C8 challenge infection, respectively. Post-immunization plasma showed a significantly lower capacity to block heterologous parasite development in primary human hepatocytes compared to NF54. Whole genome sequencing showed that NF135. C10 and NF166. C8 have amino acid changes in multiple antigens targeted by CPS-induced antibodies. Volunteers protected against heterologous challenge were among the stronger immune responders to in vitro parasite stimulation.
   Conclusions: Although highly protective against homologous parasites, NF54-CPS-induced immunity is less effective against heterologous parasite clones both in vivo and in vitro. Our data indicate that whole sporozoite-based vaccine approaches require more potent immune responses for heterologous protection.

TI A novel diagnostic method for malaria using loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification (LAMP) and MinION (TM) nanopore sequencer
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: A simple and accurate molecular diagnostic method for malaria is urgently needed due to the limitations of conventional microscopic examination. In this study, we demonstrate a new diagnostic procedure for human malaria using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and the MinION (TM) nanopore sequencer.
   Methods: We generated specific LAMP primers targeting the 18S-rRNA gene of all five human Plasmodium species including two P. ovale subspecies (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale wallikeri, P. ovale curtisi, P. knowlesi and P. malariae) and examined human blood samples collected from 63 malaria patients in Indonesia. Additionally, we performed amplicon sequencing of our LAMP products using MinION (TM) nanopore sequencer to identify each Plasmodium species.
   Results: Our LAMP method allowed amplification of all targeted 18S-rRNA genes of the reference plasmids with detection limits of 10-100 copies per reaction. Among the 63 clinical samples, 54 and 55 samples were positive by nested PCR and our LAMP method, respectively. Identification of the Plasmodium species by LAMP amplicon sequencing analysis using the MinION (TM) was consistent with the reference plasmid sequences and the results of nested PCR.
   Conclusions: Our diagnostic method combined with LAMP and MinION (TM) could become a simple and accurate tool for the identification of human Plasmodium species, even in resource-limited situations.

TI High-Sensitivity Assays for Plasmodium falciparum Infection by
   Immuno-Polymerase Chain Reaction Detection of PfIDE(h) and PfLDH
   Antigens
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Rapid diagnostic tests based on Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein II (PfHRP-II) and P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) antigens are widely deployed for detection of P. falciparum infection; however, these tests often miss cases of low-level parasitemia, and PfHRP-II tests can give false-negative results when P. falciparum strains do not express this antigen.
   Methods. We screened proteomic data for highly expressed P. falciparum proteins and compared their features to those of PfHRP-II and PfLDH biomarkers. Search criteria included high levels of expression, conservation in all parasite strains, and good correlation of antigen levels with parasitemia and its clearance after drug treatment. Different assay methods were compared for sensitive detection of parasitemia in P. falciparum cultures.
   Results. Among potential new biomarkers, a P. falciparum homolog of insulin-degrading enzyme (PfIDE(h)) met our search criteria. Comparative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with monoclonal antibodies against PfLDH or PfIDE(h) showed detection limits of 100-200 parasites/mu L and 200-400 parasites/mu L, respectively. Detection was dramatically improved by use of real-time immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to parasitemia limits of 0.02 parasite/mu L and 0.78 parasite/mu L in PfLDH- and PfIDE(h)-based assays, respectively.
   Conclusions. The ability of PfLDH- or PfIDE(h)-based immuno-PCR assays to detect <1 parasite/mu L suggests that improvements of bound antibody sensor technology may greatly increase the sensitivity of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.

TI Humoral and cytokine response elicited during immunisation with
   recombinant Immune Mapped protein-1 (EtIMP-1) and oocysts of Eimeria
   tenella
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB Eimeria tenella, the causative agent of caecal coccidiosis, is a pathogenic gut dwelling protozoan which can cause severe morbidity and mortality in farmed chickens. Immune mapped protein-1 (IMP-1) has been identified as an anticoccidial vaccine candidate; in the present study allelic polymorphism was assessed across the IMP-1 coding sequence in E. tenella isolates from four countries and compared with the UK reference Houghton strain. Nucleotide diversity was low, limited to expansion/contraction of a CAG triplet repeat and five substitutions, three of which were non-synonymous. The EtIMP-1 coding sequence from a cloned Indian E. tenella isolate was expressed in E. colt and purified as a His-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein. An in-vivo vaccination and challenge trial was conducted to test the vaccine potential of recombinant EtIMP-1 (rEtIMP-1) and to compare post-vaccination immune responses of chickens to those stimulated by live oocyst infection. Following challenge, parasite replication measured using quantitative PCR was significantly reduced in chickens that had been vaccinated with rEtIMP-1 (rIC group; 67% reduction compared to UC or unimmunised controls; 79% reduction compared to rTC group or recombinant thioredoxin mock-immunised controls, p < 0.05), or the birds vaccinated by infection with oocysts (OC group, 90% compared to unimmunised controls). Chickens vaccinated with oocysts (OC) had significantly higher levels of interferon gamma in their serum post-challenge, compared to rEtIMP-1 vaccinated birds (rIC). Conversely rEtIMP-1 (rIC) vaccinated birds had significantly higher antigen specific serum IgY responses, correlating with higher serum IL-4 (both p < 0.05).

TI A novel method for extracting nucleic acids from dried blood spots for
   ultrasensitive detection of low-density Plasmodium falciparum and
   Plasmodium vivax infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Greater Mekong Subregion countries are committed to eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria by 2025. Current elimination interventions target infections at parasite densities that can be detected by standard microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). More sensitive detection methods have been developed to detect lower density "asymptomatic" infections that may represent an important transmission reservoir. These ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (usPCR) tests have been used to identify target populations for mass drug administration (MDA). To date, malaria usPCR tests have used either venous or capillary blood sampling, which entails complex sample collection, processing and shipping requirements. An ultrasensitive method performed on standard dried blood spots (DBS) would greatly facilitate the molecular surveillance studies needed for targeting elimination interventions.
   Methods: A highly sensitive method for detecting Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax 18S ribosomal RNA from DBS was developed by empirically optimizing nucleic acid extraction conditions. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using spiked DBS samples that were dried and stored under simulated field conditions. Further, to assess its utility for routine molecular surveillance, two cross-sectional surveys were performed in Myanmar during the wet and dry seasons.
   Results: The lower LoD of the DBS-based ultrasensitive assay was 20 parasites/mL for DBS collected on Whatman 3MM filter paper and 23 parasites/mL for Whatman 903 Protein Saver cards-equivalent to 1 parasite per 50 mu L DBS. This is about 5000-fold more sensitive than standard RDTs and similar to the LoD of <= 16-22 parasites/mL reported for other ultrasensitive methods based on whole blood. In two cross-sectional surveys in Myanmar, nearly identical prevalence estimates were obtained from contemporaneous DBS samples and capillary blood samples collected during the wet and dry season.
   Conclusions: The DBS-based ultrasensitive method described in this study shows equal sensitivity as previously described methods based on whole blood, both in its limit of detection and prevalence estimates in two field surveys. The reduced cost and complexity of this method will allow for the scale-up of surveillance studies to target MDA and other malaria elimination interventions, and help lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of low-density malaria infections.

TI Detection of Plasmodium Infection by the illumigene Malaria Assay
   Compared to Reference Microscopy and Real- Time PCR
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Malaria is one of the leading causes of infectious disease in travelers returning from the tropics. The diagnosis of malaria is typically performed by examining Giemsa-stained thick and thin peripheral blood smears, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and requires high levels of proficiency. Alternatively, loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a new molecular method, which is rapid, sensitive, and requires less capital equipment and technological training. We conducted a retrospective study comparing two formats of a commercial LAMP assay (Meridian illumigene malaria [M] and malaria Plus [MP]) versus reference microscopy on archived blood specimens (n = 140) obtained from unique returning travelers suspected of having malaria. Discrepant results were resolved by either repeat testing or a laboratory developed ultrasensitive real-time PCR method. On initial testing, the Meridian illumigene M and MP kits had sensitivities of 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.7 to 99.7%) and 100.0% (95.1 to 100.0%) and specificities of 93.8% (84.8 to 98.3%) and 91.5% (81.3 to 97.2%), respectively, versus reference microscopy. We project a significant cost reduction in low prevalence settings where malaria is not endemic with LAMP-based malaria screening given the excellent negative predictive value achieved with LAMP.

TI High-resolution melting PCR assay, applicable for diagnostics and
   screening studies, allowing detection and differentiation of several
   Babesia spp. infecting humans and animals
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB The goal of the study was to design a single tube PCR test for detection and differentiation of Babesia species in DNA samples obtained from diverse biological materials. A multiplex, single tube PCR test was designed for amplification of approximately 400 bp region of the Babesia 18S rRNA gene. Universal primers were designed to match DNA of multiple Babesia spp. and to have low levels of similarity to DNA sequences of other intracellular protozoa and Babesia hosts. The PCR products amplified from Babesia DNA isolated from human, dog, rodent, deer, and tick samples were subjected to high-resolution melting analysis for Babesia species identification. The designed test allowed detection and differentiation of four Babesia species, three zoonotic (B. microti, B. divergens, B. venatorum) and one that is generally not considered zoonotic-Babesia canis. Both detection and identification of all four species were possible based on the HRM curves of the PCR products in samples obtained from the following: humans, dogs, rodents, and ticks. No cross-reactivity with DNA of Babesia hosts or Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii was observed. The lack of cross-reactivity with P. falciparum DNA might allow using the assay in endemic malaria areas. The designed assay is the first PCR-based test for detection and differentiation of several Babesia spp. of medical and veterinary importance, in a single tube reaction. The results of the study show that the designed assay for Babesia detection and identification could be a practical and inexpensive tool for diagnostics and screening studies of diverse biological materials.

TI Genetic diversity in the C-terminus of merozoite surface protein 1 among
   Plasmodium knowlesi isolates from Selangor and Sabah Borneo, Malaysia
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of macaques, has emerged as an important parasite of humans. Despite the significance of P. knowlesi malaria in parts of Southeast Asia, very little is known about the genetic variation in this parasite. Our aim here was to explore sequence variation in a molecule called the 42 kDa merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), which is found on the surface of blood stages of Plasmodium spp. and plays a key role in erythrocyte invasion. Several studies of P. falciparum have reported that the C-terminus (a 42 kDa fragment) of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-142; consisting of MSP-119 and MSP-133) is a potential candidate for a malaria vaccine. However, to date, no study has yet investigated the sequence diversity of the gene encoding P. knowlesi MSP-142 (comprising Pk-msp-119 and Pk-msp-133) among isolates in Malaysia. The present study explored this aspect. Twelve P. knowlesi isolates were collected from patients from hospitals in Selangor and Sabah Borneo, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2014. The Pk-msp-1(42) gene was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (pi) were studied among the isolates. There was relatively high genetic variation among P. knowlesi isolates; overall Hd and pi were 1 +/- 0.034 and 0.01132 +/- 0.00124, respectively. A total of nine different haplotypes related to amino acid alterations at 13 positions, and the Pk-MSP-1(19) sequence was found to be more conserved than Pk-msp-1(33). We have found evidence for negative selection in Pk-msp-(42) as well as the 33 kDa and 19 kDa fragments by comparing the rate of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions. Future investigations should study large numbers of samples from disparate geographical locations to critically assess whether this molecule might be a potential vaccine target for P. knowlesi.

TI The Incidence of Current Infection with Different Human Malaria Species
   by Polymerase Chain Reaction for Diagnosis of Suspicious Malaria
   Patients on Elimination Region Sistan and Baluchistan Province,
   Southeast of Iran
SO JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB Background: Malaria, as a parasitic disease, is one of the most important public health problems in Iran. Malaria is mainly diagnosed by peripheral blood smear, stained by Giemsa; in Iran it is also diagnosed by blood smear that is highly depends on technician's skills and laboratory properties.
   Objectives: Correct diagnosis of malaria and identification of human malaria species in spite of the measures taken to eliminate the disease in Iran, have made the complete understanding of malaria epidemiology critical. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the epidemiology of 2 species of human Plasmodium in Sistan and Baluchistan province using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
   Methods: The present descriptive study was conducted on 100 patients suspected to malaria infection who referred to health centers of Chabahar, Iranshahr, Nikshahr, and Sarbaz districts. DNAs were extracted from blood samples using the specific kit, and nested-PCR reaction was performed to identify the Plasmodium species according to NP-2013 protocol.
   Results: Molecular analysis was performed on 100 samples suspected of malaria; 84 negative and 16 positive samples were detected including 8 Plasmodium vivax, 2 P. falciparum, and 6 mixed infections (P. vivax and P. falciparum). No P. ovale or P. malariae was observed.
   Conclusions: The results showed that malaria had a decreasing trend in Sistan and Baluchistan province. Therefore, the malaria elimination program is applicable and attainable in this region as a goal.

TI Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in a traveller returning from the
   Philippines to Italy, 2016
SO NEW MICROBIOLOGICA
AB Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian parasite responsible for most human cases of malaria in Malaysian Borneo. A timely recognition of infection is crucial because of the risk of severe disease due to the rapid increase in parasitemia. We report a case of P. knowlesi infection in a traveller who developed fever and thrombocytopenia after returning from the Philippines in 2016. Rapid antigen test was negative, microscopy examination showed parasites similar to Plasmodium malariae, with a parasite count of 10,000 parasites per ae L blood, while molecular testing identified P. knowlesi infection. Treatment with atovaquone-proguanil led to resolution of fever and restoration of platelet count in two days. P. knowlesi infection should be suspected in febrile travellers returning from South East Asia. Due to the low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests and the low specificity of microscopy, confirmation by molecular tests is recommended.

TI The Importance of the Contribution of Rapid Test, Serological and
   Molecular Methods in the Diagnosis of Two Imported Malaria Cases with
   Atypical Microscopy
SO MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB Malaria is a widespread and life-threatening disease in tropical and subtropical regions. In patients with typical clinical symptoms, malaria is considered as a preliminary diagnosis if there is a travel history to malaria-endemic areas. The basis of the laboratory diagnosis of malaria is the microscopic examination of Giemsa stained smears. On the other hand, the diagnosis and differentiation of Plasmodium species with microscopic examination may have some difficulties. In the first case, adifferent appearance from the classical Plasmodium vivax erythrocytic forms in infected erythrocytes were detected in 1% of all erythrocytes in thin smear blood preparations of a 26-year-old male with complaints of fever and chills and a story of travel to Nigeria. It was observed that parasitic nuclei were not prominent, and were located in the cytoplasm irregularly as chromatin or dye particles, nucleus fragments similar to Schuffner's granules in the form of scattered and granular spots were present in some erythrocytes, the cytoplasm of some Plasmodium erythrocytic forms were irregular and nuclei were not seen. There were no Schuffner's granules in any of the infected erythrocytes. P. vivax was detected by the rapid diagnostic test (OptiMAL, DiaMed GmbH, Switzerland), which searches for the antigens of Plasmodium species, in the peripheral blood sample of the patients. The P. vivax 18S rRNA gene was also detected by the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies against Plasmodium species were searched by using the Pan Malaria Antibody CELISA (CeLLabs Pty Ltd, Brookvale, Australia) kit in the patient's serum sample and the optical density (OD) value of the patient sample was measured five times the OD value of the positive control. In the second case, adifferent appearance from the classical P. falciparum erythrocytic forms in infected erythrocytes were detected in 12% of all erythrocytes in thin smear blood preparations of a 31-year-old male who has been suffering from persistent fever, severe headache, pain in the eyes and was known to be working in Nigeria. It was observed that some Plasmodium trophozoites have 1/3 of the size of erythrocytes such as P. vivax and have non-granular cytoplasm, some erythrocytic forms were round and the nucleus and cytoplasm were hardly distinguished, some of them were seen as crescent and close to the nucleus of the cytoplasm and some erythrocytic forms had characteristically a single nucleus and a scattered cytoplasm, similar to mature trophozoites of P. vivax. Although the Plasmodium young trophozoites were similar to P. vivax in means of magnitude, the forms in which the nuclei adhered to the erythrocyte wall were common. There were no P. falciparum gametocyte forms. P. falciparum like young trophozoite was observedonly in one of the four smears. P. falciparum was detected by the commercial rapid diagnostic test and P. falciparum 18S rRNA gene was also detected by the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antibody formation against Plasmodium species was not detected in the ELISA test. In these case reports, the importance of the support of rapid diagnostic tests, serological and molecular methods to microscopic diagnosis and species determination of two imported malaria cases were demonstrated.

TI Acute undifferentiated fever in India: a multicentre study of aetiology
   and diagnostic accuracy
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of malaria, bacteraemia, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya and dengue among hospitalized patients with acute undifferentiated fever in India, and to describe the performance of standard diagnostic methods.
   Methods: During April 2011-November 2012, 1564 patients aged >= 5 years with febrile illness for 2-14 days were consecutively included in an observational study at seven community hospitals in six states in India. Malaria microscopy, blood culture, Dengue rapid NS1 antigen and IgM Combo test, Leptospira IgM ELISA, Scrub typhus IgM ELISA and Chikungunya IgM ELISA were routinely performed at the hospitals. Second line testing, Dengue IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA), Scrub typhus immunofluorescence (IFA), Leptospira Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), malaria PCR and malaria immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Parahit Total (TM) were performed at the coordinating centre. Convalescence samples were not available. Case definitions were as follows: Leptospirosis: Positive ELISA and positive MAT. Scrub typhus: Positive ELISA and positive IFA. Dengue: Positive RDT and/or positive MAC-ELISA. Chikungunya: Positive ELISA. Bacteraemia: Growth in blood culture excluding those defined as contaminants. Malaria: Positive genus-specific PCR.
   Results: Malaria was diagnosed in 17% (268/1564) and among these 54% had P. falciparum. Dengue was diagnosed in 16% (244/1564). Bacteraemia was found in 8% (124/1564), and among these Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi constituted 35%. Scrub typhus was diagnosed in 10%, leptospirosis in 7% and chikungunya in 6%. Fulfilling more than one case definition was common, most frequent in chikungunya where 26% (25/98) also had positive dengue test.
   Conclusions: Malaria and dengue were the most common causes of fever in this study. A high overlap between case definitions probably reflects high prevalence of prior infections, cross reactivity and subclinical infections, rather than high prevalence of coinfections. Low accuracy of routine diagnostic tests should be taken into consideration when approaching the patient with acute undifferentiated fever in India.

TI Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification for asymptomatic malaria
   detection in challenging field settings: Technical performance and pilot
   implementation in the Peruvian Amazon
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) methodology offers an opportunity for point-of-care (POC) molecular detection of asymptomatic malaria infections. However, there is still little evidence on the feasibility of implementing this technique for population screenings in isolated field settings.
   Methods
   Overall, we recruited 1167 individuals from terrestrial ('road') and hydric ('riverine') communities of the Peruvian Amazon for a cross-sectional survey to detect asymptomatic malaria infections. The technical performance of LAMP was evaluated in a subgroup of 503 samples, using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) as reference standard. The operational feasibility of introducing LAMP testing in the mobile screening campaigns was assessed based on field-suitability parameters, along with a pilot POC-LAMP assay in a riverine community without laboratory infrastructure.
   Results
   LAMP had a sensitivity of 91.8% (87.7-94.9) and specificity of 91.9% (87.8-95.0), and the overall accuracy was significantly better among samples collected during road screenings than riverine communities (p <= 0.004). LAMP-based diagnostic strategy was successfully implemented within the field-team logistics and the POC-LAMP pilot in the riverine community allowed for a reduction in the turnaround time for case management, from 12-24 hours to less than 5 hours. Specimens with haemolytic appearance were regularly observed in riverine screenings and could help explaining the hindered performance/interpretation of the LAMP reaction in these communities.
   Conclusions
   LAMP-based molecular malaria diagnosis can be deployed outside of reference laboratories, providing similar performance as qPCR. However, scale-up in remote field settings such as riverine communities needs to consider a number of logistical challenges (e.g. environmental conditions, labour-intensiveness in large population screenings) that can influence its optimal implementation.

CA OZ-Piperaquine Study Grp
TI A randomised, double-blind clinical phase II trial of the efficacy,
   safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose combination
   treatment with artefenomel and piperaquine in adults and children with
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: The clinical development of a single encounter treatment for uncomplicated malaria has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of antimalarials. Exploratory data suggested that the combination of artefenomel and piperaquine phosphate (PQP) has the potential to achieve satisfactory cure rates as a single dose therapy. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether a single dose of artefenomel (800 mg) plus PQP in ascending doses is an efficacious treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the 'target' population of children <= 5 years of age in Africa as well as Asian patients of all ages.
   Methods: Patients in six African countries and in Vietnam were randomised to treatment with follow-up for 42-63 days. Efficacy, tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Additional key objectives were to characterise the exposure-response relationship for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28 post-dose (ACPR28) and to further investigate Kelch13 mutations. Patients in Africa (n = 355) and Vietnam (n = 82) were included, with 85% of the total population being children < 5 years of age.
   Results: ACPR28 in the per protocol population (95% confidence interval) was 70.8% (61.13-79.19), 68.4% (59.13-76.66) and 78.6% (70.09-85.67) for doses of 800 mg artefenomel with 640 mg, 960 mg and 1440 mg of PQP respectively. ACPR28 was lower in Vietnamese than in African patients (66.2%; 54.55-76.62 and 74.5%; 68.81-79.68) respectively. Within the African population, efficacy was lowest in the youngest age group of >= 0.5 to <= 2 years, 52.7% (38.80-66.35). Initial parasite clearance was twice as long in Vietnam than in Africa. Within Vietnam, the frequency of the Kelch13 mutation was 70.1% and was clearly associated with parasite clearance half-life (PCt1/2). The most significant tolerability finding was vomiting (28.8%).
   Conclusions: In this first clinical trial evaluating a single encounter antimalarial therapy, none of the treatment arms reached the target efficacy of > 95% PCR-adjusted ACPR at day 28. Achieving very high efficacy following single dose treatment is challenging, since > 95% of the population must have sufficient concentrations to achieve cure across a range of parasite sensitivities and baseline parasitaemia levels. While challenging, the development of tools suitable for deployment as single encounter curative treatments for adults and children in Africa and to support elimination strategies remains a key development goal.

TI Humoral protection against mosquito bite-transmitted Plasmodium
   falciparum infection in humanized mice
SO NPJ VACCINES
AB A malaria vaccine that prevents infection will be an important new tool in continued efforts of malaria elimination, and such vaccines are under intense development for the major human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Antibodies elicited by vaccines can block the initial phases of parasite infection when sporozoites are deposited into the skin by mosquito bite and then target the liver for further development. However, there are currently no standardized in vivo preclinical models that can measure the inhibitory activity of antibody specificities against Pf sporozoite infection via mosquito bite. Here, we use human liver-chimeric mice as a challenge model to assess prevention of natural Pf sporozoite infection by antibodies. We demonstrate that these mice are consistently infected with Pf by mosquito bite and that this challenge can be combined with passive transfer of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal human IgG from immune serum to measure antibody-mediated blocking of parasite infection using bioluminescent imaging. This methodology is useful to down-select functional antibodies and to investigate mechanisms or immune correlates of protection in clinical trials, thereby informing rational vaccine optimization.

TI Molecular epidemiology of mosquitoes for the transmission of forest
   malaria in south-central Vietnam
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Human infection caused by non-human primate malarial parasites, such as Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium cynomolgi, occurs naturally in Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam. Members of the Anopheles dirus species complex are known to be important vectors of human malarial parasites in the forested areas of southern and central Vietnam, including those in Khanh Phu commune and Khanh Hoa Province. Recent molecular epidemiological studies in Vietnam have reported cases of co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and P. knowlesi in An. dirus. The commonly found macaques in the forest in the forested areas are suspected to be bitten by the same An. dirus population that bites humans. A recent epidemiological study identified six species of malarial parasites in sporozoite-infected An. dirus using polymerase chain reaction, of which P. vivax was the most common, followed by P. knowlesi, Plasmodium inui, P. cynomolgi, Plasmodium coatneyi, and P. falciparum. Based on a gametocyte analysis, the same allelic gametocyte types were observed in both humans and mosquitoes at similar frequencies. These observations suggest that people who stay overnight in the forests are frequently infected with both human and non-human primate malarial parasites, leading to the emergence of novel zoonotic malaria. Moreover, it is suggested that mosquito vector populations should be controlled and monitored closely.

TI Plasmodium falciparum EPCR-binding PfEMP1 expression increases with
   malaria disease severity and is elevated in retinopathy negative
   cerebral malaria
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: Expression of group A and the A-like subset of group B Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is associated with severe malaria (SM). The diversity of var sequences combined with the challenges of distinct classification of patient pathologies has made studying the role of distinct PfEMP1 variants on malaria disease severity challenging. The application of retinopathy in the recent years has provided a further method to clinically evaluate children with cerebral malaria (CM). The question of whether children with clinical CM but no retinopathy represent a completely different disease process or a subgroup within the spectrum of CM remains an important question in malaria. In the current study, we use newly designed primer sets with the best coverage to date in a large cohort of children with SM to determine the role of var genes in malaria disease severity and especially CM as discriminated by retinopathy.
   Methods: We performed qRT-PCR targeting the different subsets of these var genes on samples from Ugandan children with CM (n = 98, of whom 50 had malarial retinopathy [RP] and 47 did not [RN]), severe malarial anemia (SMA, n = 47), and asymptomatic parasitemia (AP, n = 14). The primers used in this study were designed based on var sequences from 226 Illumina whole genome sequenced P. falciparum field isolates.
   Results: Increasing severity of illness was associated with increasing levels of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding PfEMP1. EPCR-binding PfEMP1 transcript levels were highest in children with combined CM and SMA and then decreased by level of disease severity: RP CM > RN CM > SMA > AP.
   Conclusions: The study findings indicate that PfEMP1 binding to EPCR is important in the pathogenesis of SM, including RN CM, and suggest that increased expression of EPCR-binding PfEMP1 is associated with progressively more severe disease. Agents that block EPCR-binding of PfEMP1 could provide novel interventions to prevent or decrease disease severity in malaria.

TI Impact of Intermittent Preventive Treatment During Pregnancy on
   Plasmodium falciparum Drug Resistance-Mediating Polymorphisms in Uganda
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. In a recent trial of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) in Uganda, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was superior to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in preventing maternal and placental malaria.
   Methods. We compared genotypes using sequencing, fluorescent microsphere, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays at loci associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolated from subjects receiving DP or SP.
   Results. Considering aminoquinoline resistance, DP was associated with increased prevalences of mutations at pfmdr1 N86Y, pfmdr1 Y184F, and pfcrt K76T compared to SP (64.6% vs 27.4%, P < .001; 93.9% vs 59.2%, P < .001; and 87.7% vs 75.4%, P = .03, respectively). Increasing plasma piperaquine concentration at the time of parasitemia was associated with increasing pfmdr1 86Y prevalence; no infections with the N86 genotype occurred with piperaquine >2.75 ng/mL. pfkelch13 propeller domain polymorphisms previously associated with artemisinin resistance were not identified. Recently identified markers of piperaquine resistance were uncommon and not associated with DP. Considering antifolate resistance, SP was associated with increased prevalence of a 5-mutation haplotype (pfdhfr 51I, 59R, and 108N; pfdhps 437G and 581G) compared to DP (90.8% vs 60.0%, P = .001).
   Conclusions. IPTp selected for genotypes associated with decreased sensitivity to treatment regimens, but genotypes associated with clinically relevant DP resistance in Asia have not emerged in Uganda.

TI High prevalence of very-low Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
   parasitaemia carriers in the Peruvian Amazon: insights into local and
   occupational mobility-related transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The incidence of malaria due both to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazon has risen in the past 5 years. This study tested the hypothesis that the maintenance and emergence of malaria in hypoendemic regions such as Amazonia is determined by submicroscopic and asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitaemia carriers. The present study aimed to precisely quantify the rate of very-low parasitaemia carriers in two sites of the Peruvian Amazon in relation to transmission patterns of P.vivax and P.falciparum in this area.
   Methods: This study was carried out within the Amazonian-ICEMR longitudinal cohort. Blood samples were collected for light microscopy diagnosis and packed red blood cell (PRBC) samples were analysed by qPCR. Plasma samples were tested for total IgG reactivity against recombinant PvMSP-10 and PfMSP-10 antigens by ELISA. Occupation and age 10 years and greater were considered surrogates of occupation-related mobility. Risk factors for P. falciparum and P. vivax infections detected by PRBC-qPCR were assessed by multilevel logistic regression models.
   Results: Among 450 subjects, the prevalence of P. vivax by PRBC-PCR (25.1%) was sixfold higher than that determined by microscopy (3.6%). The prevalence of P.falciparum infection was 4.9% by PRBC-PCR and 0.2% by microscopy. More than 40% of infections had parasitaemia under 5 parasites/mu L. Multivariate analysis for infections detected by PRBC-PCR showed that participants with recent settlement in the study area (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.03: 4.2), age >= 30 years (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6:6.9) and seropositivity to P. vivax (AOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0:3.2) had significantly higher likelihood of P. vivax infection, while the odds of P. falciparum infection was higher for participants between 10 and 29 years (AOR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3:91.1) and with a previous P. falciparum infection (AOR 10.4; 95% CI 1.5:71.1).
   Conclusions: This study confirms the contrasting transmission patterns of P. vivax and P.falciparum in the Peruvian Amazon, with stable local transmission for P.vivax and the source of P.falciparum to the study villages dominated by very low parasitaemia carriers, age 10 years and older, who had travelled away from home for work and brought P.falciparum infection with them.

TI Molecular surveillance of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in Plasmodium
   falciparum isolates from Mozambique
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria programmes use Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria diagnosis. The deletion of this target antigen could potentially lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and continuation of active transmission.
   Methods: Plasmodium falciparum isolates (n = 1162) collected in Southern Mozambique were assessed by RDTs, microscopy and/or 18SrRNA qPCR. pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions were investigated in isolates from individuals who were negative by RDT but positive by microscopy and/or qPCR (n = 69) using gene-specific PCRs, with kelch13 PCR as the parasite DNA control.
   Results: Lack of pfhrp2 PCR amplification was observed in one of the 69 isolates subjected to molecular analysis [ 1.45% (95% CI 0.3-7.8%)].
   Conclusions: The low prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions suggests that RDTs will detect the vast majority of the P.falciparum infections. Nevertheless, active surveillance for changing deletion frequencies is required.

TI Diagnostic performance of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification
   (LAMP) based illumigene (R) malaria assay in a non-endemic region
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Light microscopy and antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests are the primary diagnostic tools for detecting malaria, although being labour-intensive and frequently challenged by lack of personnel's experience and low levels of parasite density. The latter being especially important in non-endemic settings. Novel molecular techniques aim to overcome this drawback. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the illumigene malaria assay (R) (Meridian Bioscience) compared to microscopy, RDT and real-time PCR. This loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Plasmodium spp. DNA in human venous whole blood samples.
   Methods: The illumigene assay was assessed on a retrospective panel of stored blood samples (n = 103) from returned travellers and external quality control samples (n = 12). Additionally the assay was prospectively assessed on 30 fresh routine samples with a request for malaria diagnosis. The illumigene assay was compared to microscopy, RDT and Plasmodium species specific real-time PCR.
   Results: In the retrospective evaluation, the illumigene assay showed 100% agreement with the real-time PCR, RDT and microscopy yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.1-100% and 89.7-100%, respectively). Seven samples from patients recently treated for Plasmodium falciparum infection that were RDT positive and microscopy negative yielded positive test results. The performance of the illumigene assay equals that of microscopy combined with RDT in the prospective panel with three false negative RDT results and one false negative microscopy result. Excellent concordance with PCR was observed. The limit of detection of the assay approached 0.5 parasites/mu L for both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
   Conclusion: In non-endemic regions where the diagnostic process for malaria infections is questioned by lack of experience and low levels of parasite densities, the illumigene assay can be of value. Due to its high sensitivity, the LAMP assay may be considered as primary diagnostic test. The results of this study indicate that negative screen results do not need further confirmation. However, before implementation, this approach needs to be confirmed in larger, prospective studies. A shortcoming of this assay is that no species identification nor determination of parasite density are possible.

TI Absence of Plasmodium inui and Plasmodium cynomolgi, but detection of
   Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax infections in asymptomatic
   humans in the Betong division of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria parasite, has become the main cause of malaria in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Epidemiological data on malaria for Sarawak has been derived solely from hospitalized patients, and more accurate epidemiological data on malaria is necessary. Therefore, a longitudinal study of communities affected by knowlesi malaria was undertaken.
   Methods: A total of 3002 blood samples on filter paper were collected from 555 inhabitants of 8 longhouses with recently reported knowlesi malaria cases in the Betong Division of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Each longhouse was visited bimonthly for a total of 10 times during a 21-month study period (Jan 2014-Oct 2015). DNA extracted from blood spots were examined by a nested PCR assay for Plasmodium and positive samples were then examined by nested PCR assays for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium inui. Blood films of samples positive by PCR were also examined by microscopy.
   Results: Genus-specific PCR assay detected Plasmodium DNA in 9 out of 3002 samples. Species-specific PCR identified 7 P. knowlesi and one P. vivax. Malaria parasites were observed in 5 thick blood films of the PCR positive samples. No parasites were observed in blood films from one knowlesi-, one vivax- and the genus-positive samples. Only one of 7 P. knowlesi- infected individual was febrile and had sought medical treatment at Betong Hospital the day after sampling. The 6 knowlesi-, one vivax- and one Plasmodium-infected individuals were afebrile and did not seek any medical treatment.
   Conclusions: Asymptomatic human P. knowlesi and P. vivax malaria infections, but not P. cynomolgi and P. inui infections, are occurring within communities affected with malaria.

TI Frequency of G6PD Mediterranean in individuals with and without malaria
   in Southern Pakistan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Pakistan has an estimated annual burden of 1.5 million malaria cases. The current situation calls for an effective malaria control and eradication programme in this country. Currently, primaquine is an attractive option for eliminating reservoirs of Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites and killing gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum. However, this drug causes haemolysis in individuals who are glucose-6-phosphate (G6PD) deficient. It is important to map G6PD deficiency and malaria distribution in Pakistan to design an effective malaria eradication regimen. Frequency of G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) in malaria patients has not been reported from Pakistan in any meaningful way. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of G6PD c.563C>T (G6PD Mediterranean) in male individuals with and without falciparum malaria.
   Methods: Two hundred and ten archived DNA samples from males (110 from falciparum malaria patients and 100 from healthy individuals) were utilized in this study. Healthy blood donors were selected based on stringent pre-defined criteria. Patients were confirmed for malaria parasites on microscopy and or immune chromatographic assay detecting P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2. Parasitaemia was also computed. DNA samples were tested for G6PD c.563C>T mutation through PCR-RFLP according to the previously defined protocol and its allelic frequency was computed.
   Results: G6PD c.563C>T was observed in four of 110 patients with falciparum malaria and in two of 100 healthy donors. Mean (+/- SD) haemoglobin, median (IQR) platelet and median (IQR) parasite count in G6PD-deficient malaria-patients were 8.9 +/- 0.9 g/dL, 124 x 109/L (IQR 32, 171) and 57,920/mu L of blood (IQR 12,920, 540,000) respectively.
   Conclusions: Cumulative allelic frequency for G6PD 563c.C>T was 0.0285 detected in 6 of 210 X-chromosomes in Southern Pakistan. Frequency for this G6PD allele was 0.0364 in malaria-patients and 0.0200 in healthy individuals. Large studies including females are needed to elucidate the true burden of G6PDd in malaria-endemic areas. The information will enable local health policy makers to design effective strategies for eliminating malaria form this region.

TI Very high carriage of gametocytes in asymptomatic low-density Plasmodium
   falciparum and P. vivax infections in western Thailand
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Low-density asymptomatic infections of Plasmodium spp. are common in low endemicity areas worldwide, but outside Africa, their contribution to malaria transmission is poorly understood. Community-based studies with highly sensitive molecular diagnostics are needed to quantify the asymptomatic reservoir of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections in Thai communities.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 4309 participants was conducted in three endemic areas in Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi provinces of Thailand in 2012. The presence of P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites was determined using 18S rRNA qPCR. Gametocytes were also detected by pfs25 / pvs25 qRT-PCRs.
   Results: A total of 133 individuals were found infected with P. vivax (3.09%), 37 with P. falciparum (0.86%), and 11 with mixed P. vivax/ P. falciparum (0.26%). The clear majority of both P. vivax (91.7%) and P. falciparum (89.8%) infections were not accompanied by any febrile symptoms. Infections with either species were most common in adolescent and adult males. Recent travel to Myanmar was highly associated with P. falciparum (OR = 9.0, P = 0.001) but not P. vivax infections (P = 0.13). A large number of P. vivax (71.5%) and P. falciparum (72.0%) infections were gametocyte positive by pvs25/pfs25 qRT-PCR. Detection of gametocyte-specific pvs25 and pfs25 transcripts was strongly dependent on parasite density. pvs25 transcript numbers, a measure of gametocyte density, were also highly correlated with parasite density (r(2) = 0.82, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Asymptomatic infections with Plasmodium spp. were common in western Thai communities in 2012. The high prevalence of gametocytes indicates that these infections may contribute substantially to the maintenance of local malaria transmission.

AB Background: Transfusion-transmitted malaria is undoubtedly a potential health hazard for blood recipients. Egypt is still on the prevention of reintroduction phase of malaria control program. Fayoum Governorate is considered one of the high-risk foci in Egypt due to its geology. However, no studies have been reported to evaluate the current status of subclinical Plasmodium infection based on sensitive molecular techniques. Moreover, screening of malaria is not listed within screening protocols of blood-borne pathogens in Fayoum blood banks.
   Objective: To assess the current prevalence of subclinical Plasmodium infection among blood donors of Fayoum inhabitants for transfusion biosafety. To predict any possibility of the reemergence of malaria in the governorate and the effectiveness of malaria control measures.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 400 apparently healthy blood-donors in blood transfusion center of Fayoum University hospital from Jun 2012 to Jan 2013. Conventional PCR was used to detect the 18 S ssrRNA Plasmodium gene. Results: All Fayoum inhabitants' blood donors' samples were negative for Plasmodium infection.
   Conclusions: Current applied control, and preventive measures are valid in the context of blood transfusion biosafety in Fayoum blood banks and, therefore, the implementation of a routine malaria screening test in Fayoum blood banks is not merited at this time.

TI Entomological characterization of malaria in northern Colombia through
   vector and parasite species identification, and analyses of spatial
   distribution and infection rates
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria remains a worldwide public health concern and, in Colombia, despite the efforts to stop malaria transmission, the incidence of cases has increased over the last few years. In this context, it is necessary to evaluate vector diversity, infection rates, and spatial distribution, to better understand disease transmission dynamics. This information may contribute to the planning and development of vector control strategies.
   Results: A total of 778 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in fifteen localities of Cordoba from August 2015 to October 2016. Six species were identified and overall, Anopheles albimanus was the most widespread and abundant species (83%). Other species of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus were collected, including Anopheles triannulatus (13%), Anopheles nuneztovari (1%), Anopheles argyritarsis (< 1%) and two species belonging to the Anopheles subgenus: Anopheles pseudopunctipennis (3%) and Anopheles neomaculipalpus (< 1%). Four species were found naturally infected with two Plasmodium species: Anopheles nuneztovari was detected naturally infected with Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles pseudopunctipennis with Plasmodium vivax, whereas An. albimanus and An. triannulatus were found infected with both parasite species and confirmed by nested PCR.
   Conclusions: In general, the obtained results were contrasting with previous studies in terms of the most abundant and widespread collected species, and regarding infection rates, which were higher than those previously reported. A positive relationship between mosquito local abundance at the locality level and human infection at the municipality level was found. Mosquito local abundance and the number of houses with mosquitoes in each village are factors explaining malaria human cases in these villages. The obtained results suggest that other factors related to the apparent variation in malaria eco-epidemiology in northern Colombia, must be identified, to provide health authorities with better decision tools aiming to design control and prevention strategies.

TI Detection of Plasmodium falciparum DNA in saliva samples stored at room
   temperature: potential for a non-invasive saliva-based diagnostic test
   for malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Current malaria diagnostic methods require blood collection, that may be associated with pain and the risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens, and often create poor compliance when repeated sampling is needed. On the other hand, the collection of saliva is minimally invasive; but saliva has not been widely used for the diagnosis of malaria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of saliva collected and stored at room temperature using the OMNIgene((R)).ORAL kit for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
   Methods: Paired blood and saliva samples were collected from 222 febrile patients in Cameroon. Saliva samples were collected using the OMNIgene((R)).ORAL (OM-501) kit and stored at room temperature for up to 13 months. Thick blood film microscopy (TFM) was used to detect P. falciparum blood-stage parasites in blood. Detection of P. falciparum DNA in blood and saliva was based on amplification of the multi-copy 18 s rRNA gene using the nested-polymerase chain reaction (nPCR).
   Results: Prevalence of malaria detected by TFM, nPCR-saliva and nPCR-blood was 22, 29, and 35%, respectively. Using TFM as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nPCR-saliva and nPCR-blood in detecting P. falciparum was 95 and 100%, respectively; with corresponding specificities of 93 and 87%. When nPCR-blood was used as gold standard, the sensitivity of nPCR-saliva and microscopy was 82 and 68%, respectively; whereas, the specificity was 99 and 100%, respectively. Nested PCR-saliva had a very good agreement with both TFM (kappa value 0.8) and blood PCR (kappa value 0.8). At parasitaemia > 10,000 parasites/mu l of blood, the sensitivity of nPCR-saliva was 100%. Nested PCR-saliva detected 16 sub-microscopic malaria infections. One year after sample collection, P. falciparum DNA was detected in 80% of saliva samples stored at room temperature.
   Conclusions: Saliva can potentially be used as an alternative non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of malaria and the OMNIgene((R)).ORAL kit is effective at transporting and preserving malaria parasite DNA in saliva at room temperature. The technology described in this study for diagnosis of malaria in resource-limited countries adds on to the armamentarium needed for elimination of malaria.

TI Combination of PCR and dual nanoparticles for detection of Plasmodium
   falciparum
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB Highly reactive particle-based DNA amplification was developed for the detection of the Pfg377 gene from P. falciparum gametocytes using functional magnetic latex particles (MLPs) and quantum dots encapsulated polymer particles (QDs-PPs). Firstly, MLPs were prepared from the precipitation of iron oxide, polymerization using initiator, and adsorption of aminodextran (AMD) so as to provide amino-functionalized MLPs. Furthermore, amino-containing polymer particles (PPs) were prepared by emulsifier-free polymerization and encapsulated with fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) for use as a signaling support. Subsequently, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-methyl vinyl ether) (PMAMVE) copolymer was effectively used for rapid and simple grafting of amino-modified DNA primers onto the surface of amino-functionalized particles thereby providing a promising method for particle immobilization. Herein, primer-grafted particles were applied in the amplification of the Pfg377 gene using the PCR approach. After amplification, PCR products containing PMAMVE-grafted MLPs and QDs-PPs were separated using a magnet and examined via a fluorescence microscope. PMAMVE-grafted particles were not found to inhibit the PCR reaction while facilitating efficient fluorescent detection of the PCR product. Results showed high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of amplified Pfg377 gene within only a few steps. This procedure represents a novel improvement to the post-amplification analysis.

TI A multi-level spatial analysis of clinical malaria and subclinical
   Plasmodium infections in Pailin Province, Cambodia
SO HELIYON
AB Background: The malaria burden is decreasing throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion, however transmission persists in some areas. Human movement, subclinical infections and complicated transmission patterns contribute to the persistence of malaria. This research describes the micro-geographical epidemiology of both clinical malaria and subclinical Plasmodium infections in three villages in Western Cambodia.
   Methods: Three villages in Western Cambodia were selected for the study based on high reported Plasmodium falciparum incidence. A census was conducted at the beginning of the study, including demographic information and travel history. The total population was 1766. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted every three months from June 2013 to June 2014. Plasmodium infections were detected using an ultra-sensitive, high-volume, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (uPCR) technique. Clinical episodes were recorded by village health workers. The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) were collected for all houses and all participants were linked to their respective houses using a demographic surveillance system. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
   Results: Most clinical episodes and subclinical infections occurred within a single study village. Clinical Plasmodium vivax episodes clustered spatially in each village but only lasted for a month. In one study village subclinical infections clustered in geographic proximity to clusters of clinical episodes. The largest risk factor for clinical P. falciparum episodes was living in a house where another clinical P. falciparum episode occurred (model adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 6.9; CI: 2.3-19. 8). Subclinical infections of both P. vivax and P. falciparum were associated with clinical episodes of the same species (AOR: 5.8; CI: 1.5-19.7 for P. falciparum and AOR: 14.6; CI: 8.6-25.2 for P. vivax) and self-reported overnight visits to forested areas (AOR = 3.8; CI: 1.8-7. 7 for P. falciparum and AOR = 2.9; CI: 1.7-4.8 for P. vivax).
   Discussion: Spatial clustering within the villages was transient, making the prediction of spatial clusters difficult. Interventions that are dependent on predicting spatial clusters (such as reactive case detection) would only have detected a small proportion of cases unless the entire village was screened within a limited time frame and with a highly sensitive diagnostic test. Subclinical infections may be acquired outside of the village (particularly in forested areas) and may play an important role in transmission.

TI Quantification of the association between malaria in pregnancy and
   stillbirth: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background 2.6 million stillbirths occur annually worldwide. The association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth has yet to be comprehensively quantified. We aimed to quantify the association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth, and to assess the influence of malaria endemicity on the association.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the association between confirmed malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth. We included population-based cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies (in which cases were stillbirths or perinatal deaths), and randomised controlled trials of malaria in pregnancy interventions, identified before Feb 28, 2017. We excluded studies in which malaria in pregnancy was not confirmed by PCR, light microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, or histology. The primary outcome was stillbirth. We pooled estimates of the association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth using meta-analysis. We used meta-regression to assess the influence of endemicity. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, protocol number CRD42016038742.
   Findings We included 59 studies of 995 records identified, consisting of 141 415 women and 3387 stillbirths. Plasmodium falciparum malaria detected at delivery in peripheral samples increased the odds of stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1.81 [95% CI 1.42-2.30]; I-2= 26.1%; 34 estimates), as did P falciparum detected in placental samples (OR 1.95 [1.48-2.57]; I-2= 33.6%; 31 estimates). P falciparum malaria detected and treated during pregnancy was also associated with stillbirth, but to a lesser extent (OR 1.47 [95% CI 1.13-1.92]; 19 estimates). Plasmodium vivax malaria increased the odds of stillbirth when detected at delivery (2.81 [0.77-10.22]; three estimates), but not when detected and treated during pregnancy (1.09 [0.76-1.57]; four estimates). The association between P falciparum malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth was two times greater in areas of low-to-intermediate endemicity than in areas of high endemicity (ratio of ORs 1.96 [95% CI 1.34-2.89]). Assuming all women with malaria are still parasitaemic at delivery, an estimated 20% of the 1059 700 stillbirths in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa are attributed to P falciparum malaria in pregnancy; the population attributable fraction decreases to 12%, assuming all women with malaria are treated during pregnancy.
   Interpretation P falciparum and P vivax malaria in pregnancy both increase stillbirth risk. The risk of malaria associated stillbirth is likely to increase as endemicity declines. There is a pressing need for context-appropriate, evidence-based interventions for malaria in pregnancy in low-endemicity settings. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Detecting Malaria Hotspots: A Comparison of Rapid Diagnostic Test,
   Microscopy, and Polymerase Chain Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Malaria control strategies need to respond to geographical hotspots of transmission. Detection of hotspots depends on the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used.
   Methods. We conducted cross-sectional surveys in 3 sites within Kilifi County, Kenya, that had variable transmission intensities. Rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect asymptomatic parasitemia, and hotspots were detected using the spatial scan statistic.
   Results. Eight thousand five hundred eighty-one study participants were surveyed in 3 sites. There were statistically significant malaria hotspots by RDT, microscopy, and PCR for all sites except by microscopy in 1 low transmission site. Pooled data analysis of hotspots by PCR overlapped with hotspots by microscopy at a moderate setting but not at 2 lower transmission settings. However, variations in degree of overlap were noted when data were analyzed by year. Hotspots by RDT were predictive of PCR/microscopy at the moderate setting, but not at the 2 low transmission settings. We observed long-term stability of hotspots by PCR and microscopy but not RDT.
   Conclusion. Malaria control programs may consider PCR testing to guide asymptomatic malaria hotspot detection once the prevalence of infection falls.

TI Detection of Malaria Parasites After Treatment in Travelers: A 12-months
   Longitudinal Study and Statistical Modelling Analysis
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB The rapid clearance of malaria parasite DNA from circulation has widely been accepted as a fact without being systemically investigated. We assessed the persistence of parasite DNA in travelers treated for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a malaria-free area. Venous blood was collected at the time of admission and prospectively up to one year. DNA and RNA were extracted and analyzed using species-specific and gametocyte-specific real-time PCR as well as merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2)-PCR.
   In 31 successfully treated individuals, asexual parasites were seen by microscopy until two days after treatment, whereas parasite DNA was detected by msp2- and species-specific PCR up to days 31 and 42, respectively. Statistical modelling predicted 26% (+/- 0.05 SE) species-specific PCR positivity until day 40 and estimated 48 days for all samples to become PCR negative. Gametocytes were detected by microscopy and PCR latest two days after treatment. C-T values correlated well with microscopy-defined parasite densities before but not after treatment started.
   These results reveal that PCR positivity can persist several weeks after treatment without evidence of viable sexual or asexual parasites, indicating that PCR may overestimate parasite prevalence after treatment.

TI Population Dynamics and Plasmodium falciparum (Haemosporida:
   Plasmodiidae) Infectivity Rates for the Malaria Vector Anopheles
   arabiensis (Diptera: Culicidae) at Mamfene, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB Anopheles arabiensis (Patton; Diptera: Culicidae) is a major malaria vector in the southern African region. In South Africa, effective control of this species using indoor-based interventions is reduced owing to its tendency to rest outdoors. As South Africa moves towards malaria elimination there is a need for complementary vector control strategies. One of the methods under consideration is the use of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Key to the successful implementation of an SIT programme is prior knowledge of the size and spatial distribution of the target population. Understanding mosquito population dynamics for both males and females is critical for efficient programme implementation. It is thus necessary to use outdoor-based population monitoring tools capable of sampling both sexes of the target population. In this project mosquito surveillance and evaluation of tools capable of collecting both genders were carried out at Mamfene in northern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, during the period January 2014 to December 2015. Outdoor- and indoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled in three sections of Mamfene over the 2-yr sampling period using modified plastic buckets, clay pots and window exit traps. Morphological and molecular techniques were used for species identifications of all samples. Wild-caught adult females were tested for Plasmodium falciparum (Welch; Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae) infectivity. Out of 1,705 mosquitoes collected, 1,259 (73.8%) and 255 (15%) were identified as members of either the Anopheles gambiae complex or Anopheles funestus group respectively. An. arabiensis was the most abundant species contributing 78.8% of identified specimens. Mosquito density was highest in summer and lowest during winter. Clay pots yielded 16.3 mosquitoes per trap compared to 10.5 for modified plastic buckets over the 2-yr sampling period. P. falciparum infection rates for An. arabiensis were 0.7% and 0.5% for 2014 and 2015, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed an association between An. arabiensis catches with Section and season of collection but not with sex and collection methods. These data confirmed the presence of a perennial An. arabiensis population at Mamfene and constitute the first records of P. falciparum infective An. arabiensis from South Africa, confirming this species as a major vector in the malaria endemic provinces of the country.

TI DIVERSITY, SEASONAL ABUNDANCE AND BITING ACTIVITY OF ANOPHELES SPECIES
   IN RELATION TO CLIMATIC FACTORS IN NORTHEASTERN THAILAND
SO SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB An outbreak of malaria recently occurred in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeastern Thailand where a high prevalence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has been reported. In this study, we investigated diversity, seasonal abundance and degree of outdoor biting activity of Anopheles species collected in buffalo-baited traps from January 2014 to December 2015. Of 11,765 Anopheles females belonging to 14 species collected, the four most prevalent taxa were species of the An. hyrcanus group (58.89%), the An. barbirostris complex (29.83%), An. nivipes (5.41%) and An. philippinensis (4.30%). The identities of nine species, namely, An. dirus, An. dissidens, An. minimus, An. nigerrimus, An. nitidus, An. nivipes, An. peditaeniatus, An. philippinensis, and An. rampae, were confirmed molecularly using an allele-specific (AS)-PCR assay based on sequences of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. The density of An. barbirostris s.l. showed a major peak during the rainy and cool-dry seasons, whereas members of the An. hyrcanus group were most abundant in the rainy season. A significant difference in the time of biting activity, based on mean numbers of captured females, was observed between members of the An. hyrcanus group, An. barbirostris s.l. and An. nivipes. In addition, an increase in rainfall and relative humidity influenced densities of species of the An. hyrcanus group and the An. barbirostris complex. These data lend support to the need for further studies on vectorial status of the Anopheles taxa in malaria endemic areas.

TI Residual malaria transmission dynamics varies across The Gambia despite
   high coverage of control interventions
SO PLOS ONE
AB Over the last decades, malaria has declined substantially in The Gambia but its transmission has not been interrupted. In order to better target control interventions, it is essential to understand the dynamics of residual transmission. This prospective cohort study was conducted between June 2013 and April 2014 in six pairs of villages across The Gambia. Blood samples were collected monthly during the transmission season (June-December) from all residents aged >6 months (4,194 individuals) and then in April (dry season). Entomological data were collected monthly throughout the malaria transmission season. Ownership of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets was 71.5% (2766/3869). Incidence of malaria infection and clinical disease varied significantly across the country, with the highest values in eastern (1.7/PYAR) than in central (0.2/PYAR) and western (0.1/PYAR) Gambia. Malaria infection at the beginning of the transmission season was significantly higher in individuals who slept outdoors (HR = 1.51, 95% Cl: 1.02-2.23, p = 0.04) and in those who had travelled outside the village (HR = 2.47, 95% Cl: 1.83-3.34, p<0.01). Sub-patent infections were more common in older children (HR = 1.35, 95% Cl: 1.04-1.6, p<0.01) and adults (HR = 1.53, 95% Cl: 1.23-1.89, p<0.01) than in younger children. The risk of clinical malaria was significantly higher in households with at least one infected individual at the beginning of the transmission season (HR = 1.76, p<0.01). Vector parity was significantly higher in the eastern part of the country, both in the south (90.7%, 117/129, p<0.01) and the north bank (81.1%, 227/280, p<0.01), than in the western region (41.2%, 341/826), indicating higher vector survival. There is still significant residual malaria transmission across The Gambia, particularly in the eastern region. Additional interventions able to target vectors escaping Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets and indoor residual spraying are needed to achieve malaria elimination.

TI Indoor and outdoor malaria vector surveillance in western Kenya:
   implications for better understanding of residual transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The widespread use of indoor-based malaria vector control interventions has been shown to alter the behaviour of vectors in Africa. There is an increasing concern that such changes could sustain residual transmission. This study was conducted to assess vector species composition, feeding behaviour and their contribution to indoor and outdoor malaria transmission in western Kenya.
   Methods: Anopheles mosquito collections were carried out from September 2015 to April 2016 in Ahero and Iguhu sites, western Kenya using CDC light traps (indoor and outdoor), pyrethrum spray catches (PSCs) (indoor) and pit shelters (outdoor). Species within Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus s.l. were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine mosquito blood meal sources and sporozoite infections.
   Results: A total of 10,864 female Anopheles mosquitoes comprising An. gambiae s.l. (71.4%), An. funestus s.l. (12.3%), Anopheles coustani (9.2%) and Anopheles pharoensis (7.1%) were collected. The majority (61.8%) of the anopheline mosquitoes were collected outdoors. PCR result (n = 581) revealed that 98.9% An. arabiensis and 1.1% An. gambiae s.s. constituted An. gambiae s.l. in Ahero while this was 87% An. gambiae s.s. and 13% An. arabiensis in Iguhu. Of the 108 An. funestus s.l. analysed by PCR, 98.1% belonged to An. funestus s.s. and 1.9% to Anopheles leesoni. The human blood index (HBI) and bovine blood index (BBI) of An. arabiensis was 2.5 and 73.1%, respectively. Anopheles gambiae s.s. had HBI and BBI of 50 and 28%, respectively. The HBI and BBI of An. funestus was 60 and 22.3%, respectively. Forage ratio estimate revealed that An. arabiensis preferred to feed on cattle, An. gambiae s.s. showed preference for both human and cattle, while An. funestus preferred human over other hosts. In Ahero, the sporozoite rates for An. arabiensis and An. funestus were 0.16 and 1.8%, respectively, whereas in Iguhu, the sporozoite rates for An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus were 2.3 and 2.4%, respectively. In Ahero, the estimated indoor and outdoor entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was 108.6 infective bites/person/year (79.0 from An. funestus and 29.6 from An. arabiensis) and 43.5 infective bites/person/year (27.9 from An. arabiensis and 15.6 from An. funestus), respectively. In Iguhu, the estimated indoor and outdoor EIR was 24.5 infective bites/person/year (18.8 from An. gambiae s.s. and 5.7 from An. funestus) and 5.5 infective bites/person/year (all from An. gambiae s.s.), respectively.
   Conclusion: Anopheles gambiae s.s. showed an increasing tendency to feed on cattle. Anopheles arabiensis was highly zoophagic, whereas An. funestus showed anthropophagic behaviour. While the majority of malaria transmission occurred indoor, the magnitude of outdoor transmission was considerably high. Additional control tools that complement the existing interventions are required to control residual transmission.

TI Plasmodium falciparum parasites with histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2)
   and pfhrp3 gene deletions in two endemic regions of Kenya
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deletions of the Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 and hrp3 genes can affect the performance of HRP2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Such deletions have been reported from South America, India and Eritrea. Whether these parasites are widespread in East Africa is unknown. A total of 274 samples from asymptomatic children in Mbita, western Kenya, and 61 genomic data from Kilifi, eastern Kenya, were available for analysis. PCR-confirmed samples were investigated for the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes. In samples with evidence of deletion, parasite presence was confirmed by amplifying three independent genes. We failed to amplify pfhrp2 from 25 of 131 (19.1%) PCR-confirmed samples. Of these, only 8 (10%) samples were microscopic positive and were classified as pfhrp2-deleted. Eight microscopically-confirmed pfhrp2-deleted samples with intact pfhrp3 locus were positive by HRP2-based RDT. In addition, one PCR-confirmed infection showed a deletion at the pfhrp3 locus. One genomic sample lacked pfhrp2 and one lacked pfhrp3. No sample harbored parasites lacking both genes. Parasites lacking pfhrp2 are present in Kenya, but may be detectable by HRP-based RDT at higher parasitaemia, possibly due to the presence of intact pfhrp3. These findings warrant further systematic study to establish prevalence and diagnostic significance.

TI Reassessment of asymptomatic carriers of Plasmodium spp. in an endemic
   area with a very low incidence of malaria in extra-Amazonian Brazil
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Regions with residual transmission are potential obstacles to the elimination of malaria. It is, therefore, essential to understand the factors associated with the maintenance of endemic malaria in these areas. The objective was to investigate whether the status of asymptomatic carriers of Plasmodium spp. DNA is maintained in the long term in an extra-Amazonian region of Brazil with low incidence, residual malaria transmission.
   Methods: Asymptomatic carriers of Plasmodium DNA detected in a survey carried out between 2001 and 2004 were reassessed between 2010 and 2011 using questionnaires, PCR and thick and thin blood smear tests three times at 3-month intervals.
   Results: Of the 48 carriers detected between 2001 and 2004, 37 were located. Of these, only two had positive PCR results and, as in the first survey, Plasmodium malariae DNA was detected.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that untreated dwellers from this extra-Amazonian region, who initially harbour malaria parasites, may become negative without ever developing apparent symptoms of the disease. Although the possibility of re-infection cannot be ruled out, the finding of two individuals harbouring P. malariae, both in the first and in the second survey, may be compatible with a long-term carrier state for this parasite. Since most clinical cases of malaria in the region are a consequence of infection by Plasmodium vivax, the epidemiological impact of such long-term carriage would be limited.

TI Individual and household characteristics of persons with Plasmodium
   falciparum malaria in sites with varying endemicities in Kinshasa
   Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) bears a large share of global malaria burden despite efforts to control and eliminate the disease. More detailed understanding of individual and household level characteristics associated with malaria are needed, as is an understanding of how these characteristics vary spatiotemporally and across different community-level malaria endemicities. An ongoing study in Kinshasa Province is designed to address gaps in prior malaria surveillance in the DRC by monitoring malaria across seasons, age groups and in high and low malaria sites. Across seven sites, 242 households and 1591 individuals are participating in the study. Results of the enrollment questionnaire, rapid diagnostic tests and PCR testing of dried blood spots are presented.
   Results: Overall malaria prevalence in the study cohort is high, 27% by rapid diagnostic test and 31% by polymerase chain reaction, and malaria prevalence is highly varied across very small geographic distances. Malaria prevalence is highest in children aged 6-15. While the majority of households own bed nets, bed net usage is less than 50%.
   Conclusions: The study cohort will provide an understanding of how malaria persists in populations that have varying environmental exposures, varying community-level malaria, and varying access to malaria control efforts.

   Dispersible Tablets in Pediatric Patients With Acute Uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum Malaria: A Phase 3, Randomized, Multicenter Trial
   in India and Africa
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Administration of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to infant and young children can be challenging. A formulation with accurate dose and ease of administration will improve adherence and compliance in children. The fixed-dose combination dispersible tablet of arterolane maleate (AM) 37.5 mg and piperaquine phosphate (PQP) 187.5 mg can make dosing convenient in children.
   Methods. This multicenter (India and Africa), comparative, parallel-group trial enrolled 859 patients aged 6 months to 12 years with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 2: 1 to AM-PQP (571 patients) once daily and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) (288 patients) twice daily for 3 days and followed for 42 days.
   Results. The cure rate (ie, polymerase chain reaction-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response) in the per-protocol population at day 28 was 100.0% and 98.5% (difference, 1.48% [95% confidence interval {CI},.04%-2.91%]) in the AM-PQP and AL arms, respectively, and 96.0% and 95.8% (difference, 0.14% [95% CI, -2.68% to 2.95%]) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The cure rate was comparable at day 42 in the ITT population (AM-PQP, 94.4% vs AL, 93.1%). The median parasite clearance time was 24 hours in both the arms. The median fever clearance time was 6 hours in AM-PQP and 12 hours in the AL arm. Both the treatments were found to be safe and well tolerated. Overall, safety profile of both the treatments was similar.
   Conclusions. The efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination of AM and PQP was comparable to AL for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in pediatric patients.

TI Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Ethiopia: a systematic
   review and meta-analysis
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background: As Ethiopia is one of the sub-Saharan countries with a great burden of malaria the effectiveness of first line anti-malarial drugs is the major concern. The aim of this study was to synthesize the available evidence on the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Ethiopia. This was done by performing a meta-analysis of recent studies conducted in the country on this topic.
   Methods: Studies published between January 2010 and January 2017 that reported on the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of P. falciparum malaria in Ethiopian patients were searched for using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Ten prospective single-arm cohort studies that followed patients for 28-42 days were included in this analysis. All of the included studies were deemed to be of high quality.
   Results: Ten studies involving 1179 patients that were eligible for meta-analysis were identified. At recruitment, the average parasite count per patient was 1 2981/mu l of blood. On the third day of treatment, 96.7% and 98.5% of the study subjects become fever-free and parasite-free, respectively. Based on the per protocol analysis, the cure rate after use of artemether-lumefantrine was 98.2% (polymerase chain reaction corrected) and 97.01% (polymerase chain reaction uncorrected) after 28 days of follow-up. The reinfection rate within 28 days was 1.1% and the recrudescence rate was 1.9%.
   Conclusions: This review found that the cure rate for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria using artemether-lumefantrine in Ethiopia is still high enough to recommend the drug as a first-line agent. There should be careful periodic monitoring of the efficacy of this drug, as treatment failure may occur due to resistance, sub-therapeutic levels that may occur due to non-adherence, or inadequate absorption.

TI A Novel Gametocyte Biomarker for Superior Molecular Detection of the
   Plasmodium falciparum Infectious Reservoirs
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Complete malaria eradication and optimal use of transmission-reducing interventions require knowledge of submicroscopic infectious reservoirs among asymptomatic individuals. Even submicroscopic levels of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes can infect mosquitoes and promote onward transmission. Most efforts to identify gametocyte carriers use polymerase chain reaction amplification of the gametocyte-specific transcript Pfs25.
   Methods. To expand the repertoire of biomarkers available for superior gametocyte detection, we compared the gene expression profiles of gametocytes and asynchronous blood-stage P. falciparum parasites by microarray technology. This allowed the identification of 56 molecules abundantly expressed in the gametocyte stage of the parasite. The analytical sensitivity for gametocyte detection was evaluated for 25 genes with the highest expression levels.
   Results. One candidate, Pfg17, exhibited superior analytical sensitivity against a panel of gametocyte-spiked whole blood, detecting 10 gametocytes/mL; in comparison, Pfs25 detected only 25.3 gametocytes/mL. Pfg17 also exhibited superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 19.1% more samples from blood-film microscopy-negative Ghanaian children and 40% more samples from asymptomatic adults as gametocyte positive.
   Conclusions. Cumulatively, our results suggest Pfg17 is an excellent biomarker for detecting asymptomatic infectious reservoirs otherwise missed by the most sensitive molecular method available. Our study has also improved the repertoire of transmission-stage antigens available for evaluation as candidate vaccines.

TI Detection of Plasmodium falciparum male and female gametocytes and
   determination of parasite sex ratio in human endemic populations by
   novel, cheap and robust RTqPCR assays
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The presence of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in peripheral blood is essential for human to mosquito parasite transmission. The detection of submicroscopic infections with gametocytes and the estimation of the gametocyte sex ratio are crucial to assess the human host potential ability to infect mosquitoes and transmit malaria parasites.
   Aim and objectives: The aim of this work was to develop sensitive and cheap Real Time qPCR assays for large-scale epidemiological surveys, based on detection and amplification of gametocyte sex specific transcripts selected from the literature: the female-specific pfs25 and pf glycerol kinase (pfGK) and the male-specific pfs230p and pf13 transcripts.
   Methods: RTqPCR assays were used to test the gametocyte-and sex-specific expression of the target genes using asexual stages of the gametocyteless parasite clone F12 and FACS purified male and female gametocytes of the PfDynGFP/P47mCherry line. Assays were performed on 50 blood samples collected during an epidemiological survey in the Soumousso village, Burkina Faso, West-Africa, and amplification of the human housekeeping gene 18S rRNA was employed to normalize RNA sample variability.
   Results: SYBR Green assays were developed that showed higher sensitivity compared to Taqman assays at a reduced cost. RTqPCR results confirmed that expression of pfs25 and pfs230p are female and male-specific, respectively, and introduced two novel markers, the female-specific pfGK and the male-specific pf13. A formula was derived to calculate the ratio of male to female gametocytes based on the ratio of male to female transcript copy number. Use of these assays in the field samples showed, as expected, a higher sensitivity of RTqPCR compared to microscopy. Importantly, similar values of gametocyte sex-ratio were obtained in the field samples based on the four different target combinations.
   Conclusion: Novel, sensitive, cheap and robust molecular assays were developed for the detection and quantification of female and male P. falciparum gametocytes. In particular, the RTqPCR assays based on the female-specific pfs25 and the newly described male gametocyte-specific pf13 transcripts, including normalization by the human 18S, reliably assess presence and abundance of female and male gametocytes and enable to determine their sex-ratio in human subjects in endemic areas.

TI Host age and Plasmodium falciparum multiclonality are associated with
   gametocyte prevalence: a 1-year prospective cohort study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Since Plasmodium falciparum transmission relies exclusively on sexual-stage parasites, several malaria control strategies aim to disrupt this step of the life cycle. Thus, a better understanding of which individuals constitute the primary gametocyte reservoir within an endemic population, and the temporal dynamics of gametocyte carriage, especially in seasonal transmission settings, will not only support the effective implementation of current transmission control programmes, but also inform the design of more targeted strategies.
   Methods: A 1-year prospective cohort study was initiated in June 2013 with the goal of assessing the longitudinal dynamics of P. falciparum gametocyte carriage in a village in Mali with intense seasonal malaria transmission. A cohort of 500 individuals aged 1-65 years was recruited for this study. Gametocyte prevalence was measured monthly using Pfs25-specific RT-PCR, and analysed for the effects of host age and gender, seasonality, and multiclonality of P. falciparum infection over 1 year.
   Results: Most P. falciparum infections (51-89%) in this population were accompanied by gametocytaemia throughout the 1-year period. Gametocyte prevalence among P. falciparum-positive individuals (proportion of gametocyte positive infections) was associated with age (p = 0.003) but not with seasonality (wet vs. dry) or gender. The proportion of gametocyte positive infections were similarly high in children aged 1-17 years (74-82% on median among 5 age groups), while older individuals had relatively lower proportion, and those aged > 35 years (median of 43%) had significantly lower than those aged 1-17 years (p < 0.05). Plasmodium falciparum-positive individuals with gametocytaemia were found to have significantly higher P. falciparum multiclonality than those without gametocytaemia (p < 0.033 in two different analyses).
   Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that a substantial proportion of Pf-positive individuals carries gametocytes throughout the year, and that age is a significant determinant of gametocyte prevalence among these P. falciparum-positive individuals. Furthermore, the presence of multiple P. falciparum genotypes in an infection, a common feature of P. falciparum infections in high transmission areas, is associated with gametocyte prevalence.

TI Determination of multiple-clone infection at allelic dimorphism site of
   Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-1 in the Republic of Korea by
   pyrosequencing assay
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Allelic diversity leading to multiple gene polymorphisms of vivax malaria parasites has been shown to greatly contribute to antigenic variation and drug resistance, increasing the potential for multiple-clone infections within the host. Therefore, to identify multiple-clone infections and the predominant haplotype of Plasmodium vivax in a South Korean population, P. vivax merozoite surface protein-1 (PvMSP-1) was analyzed by pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing of 156 vivax malaria-infected samples yielded 97 (62.18%) output pyrograms showing two main types of peak patterns of the dimorphic allele for threonine and alanine (T1476A). Most of the samples evaluated (88.66%) carried multiple-clone infections (wild- and mutant-types), whereas 11.34% of the same population carried only the mutant-type (1476A). In addition, each allele showed a high frequency of guanine (G) base substitution at both the first and third positions (86.07% and 81.13%, respectively) of the nucleotide combinations. Pyrosequencing of the PvMSP-1 42-kDa fragment revealed a heterogeneous parasite population, with the mutant-type dominant compared to the wild-type. Understanding the genetic diversity and multiple-clone infection rates may lead to improvements in vivax malaria prevention and strategic control plans. Further studies are needed to improve the efficacy of the pyrosequencing assay with large sample sizes and additional nucleotide positions.

TI Malaria in Children: Diagnostic Tools in Resource-Limited Settings
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Malaria contributes to a major reason for the cause of fatality and serious health problems among children mainly in various parts of tropical Africa and Asia. The extraction of DNA plays a vital role in the diagnosis of this life-threatening parasite Plasmodium. Difficulties with existing extraction methods of DNA are increasing with time including detection limits, time duration, sensitivity, availability of chemicals, and cost. Consequently, there is now renewed interest in finding of novel methods for DNA extraction of Plasmodium. However, the extraction of DNA by using microwave irradiation is found to be most convenient and suitable due to its low-cost and usage of common chemical reagents especially for the children in poor resource settings. In addition, the low cost, noninvasive malaria diagnostics tests are needed to carry out particularly for children to avoid accidental infections which may happen due to drawing blood.

TI Abundance and distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in a malaria endemic
   area along the Thai-Lao border
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB Malaria is an important public health problem in Thailand, especially along international borders. In this study, we conducted a longitudinal entomological survey in six villages and rubber plantation sites to address the spatio-temporal abundance and behavior of malaria vectors in Ubon Ratchathani Province along the Thailand-Laos border. Adult female mosquitoes were collected by human landing collections (indoor and outdoor) and by cattle bait collections twice per year, during rainy and dry seasons. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified and sibling species were determined by allele-specific PCR. Of the 10,024 Anopheles, 9,328 (93.1%) and 696 (6.9%) were collected during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. A total of 9,769 (97.5%) and 255 (2.5%) was collected on cattle and human baits, respectively. Very few primary and secondary malaria vectors were collected, consisting of 12 specimens of An. dirus, eight An. minimus, and seven An. aconitus. Of the 152 specimens of the Maculatus Group, only three were identified to An sawadwongporni by molecular methods. The others were 112 An. rampae, a non-vector, that were not amplified or were misidentified as other non-vectors. The very low density of primary malaria vectors found in the study villages suggests that entomological risk and malaria transmission is higher in neighboring forest areas. Further studies on malaria vector distribution, as well as human behaviors, are needed to understand malaria transmission dynamics in the province and to develop suitable vector control methods.

TI Preliminary efficacy investigations of oral fipronil against Anopheles
   arabiensis when administered to Zebu cattle (Bos indicus) under field
   conditions
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Globally, malaria remains one of the most important vector-borne diseases despite the extensive use of vector control, including indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). These control methods target endophagic vectors, whereas some malaria vectors, such as Anopheles arabiensis, preferentially feed outdoors on cattle, making it a complicated vector to control using conventional strategies. Our study evaluated whether treating cattle with a capsule containing the active ingredient (AI) fipronil could reduce vector density and sporozoite rates, and alter blood feeding behavior, when applied in a small-scale field study. A pilot field study was carried out in the Samia District, Western Kenya, from May to July 2015. Four plots, each comprised of 50 huts used for sleeping, were randomly designated to serve as control or treatment. A week before cattle treatment, baseline mosquito collections were performed inside the houses using mechanical aspirators. Animals in the treatment (and buffer) were administered a single oral application of fipronil at similar to 0.5 mg/kg of body weight. Indoor mosquito collections were performed once a week for four weeks following treatment. Female mosquitoes were first identified morphologically to species complex, followed by PCR-based methods to obtain species identity, sporozoite presence, and the host source of the blood meal. All three species of anophelines found in the study area (An. gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis, An. funestus s.s.) were actively transmitting Plasmodium falciparum during the study period. The indoor resting density of An. arabiensis was significantly reduced in treatment plot one at three weeks post-treatment (T1) (efficacy = 89%; T1 density = 0.08, 95% credibility intervals [0.05, 0.10]; control plot density = 0.78 [0.22, 0.29]) and at four weeks post-treatment (efficacy = 64%; T1 density = 0.16 [0.08, 0.14]; control plot density = 0.48 [0.17, 0.22]). The reduction of An. arabiensis mosquitoes captured in the treatment plot two was higher: zero females were collected after treatment. The indoor resting density of An. gambiae s.s. was not significantly different between the treatment (T1, T2) and their corresponding control plots (C1, C2). An. funestus s.s. showed an increase in density over time. The results of this preliminary study suggest that treating cattle orally with fipronil, to target exophagic and zoophagic malaria vectors, could be a valuable control strategy to supplement existing vector control interventions which target endophilic anthropophilic species.

TI The detection of cryptic Plasmodium infection among villagers in Attapeu
   province, Lao PDR
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Although the malaria burden in the Lao PDR has gradually decreased, the elimination of malaria by 2030 presents many challenges. Microscopy and malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used to diagnose malaria in the Lao PDR; however, some studies have reported the prevalence of sub-microscopic Plasmodium infections or asymptomatic Plasmodium carriers in endemic areas. Thus, highly sensitive detection methods are needed to understand the precise malaria situation in these areas.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A cross-sectional malaria field survey was conducted in 3 highly endemic malaria districts (Xaysetha, Sanamxay, Phouvong) in Attapeu province, Lao PDR in 2015, to investigate the precise malaria endemicity in the area; 719 volunteers from these villages participated in the survey. Microscopy, RDTs and a real-time nested PCR were used to detect Plasmodium infections and their results were compared. A questionnaire survey of all participants was also conducted to estimate risk factors of Plasmodium infection. Numbers of infections detected by the three methods were microscopy: P. falciparum (n = 1), P. vivax (n = 2); RDTs: P. falciparum (n = 2), P. vivax (n = 3); PCR: Plasmodium (n = 47; P. falciparum [n = 4], P. vivax [n = 41], mixed infection [n = 2]; 6.5%, 47/719). Using PCR as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 33.3% and 100.0%, respectively, for detecting P. falciparum infection, and 7.0% and 100.0%, for detecting P. vivax infection. Among the 47 participants with parasitemia, only one had a fever (>= 37.5 E C) and 31 (66.0%) were adult males. Risk factors of Plasmodium infection were males and soldiers, whereas a risk factor of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection was a history of >= 3 malaria episodes.
   Conclusions/Significance
   There were many asymptomatic Plasmodium carriers in the study areas of Attapeu province in 2015. Adult males, probably soldiers, were at high risk for malaria infection. P. vivax, the dominant species, accounted for 87.2% of the Plasmodium infections among the participants. To achieve malaria elimination in the Lao PDR, highly sensitive diagnostic tests, including PCR-based diagnostic methods should be used, and plans targeting high-risk populations and elimination of P. vivax should be designed and implemented.

TI Antifolate drug resistance: Novel mutations and haplotype distribution
   in dhps and dhfr from Northeast India
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES
AB Malaria is a major public health concern in Northeast India with a preponderance of drug-resistant strains. Until recently the partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) was sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP). Antifolate drug resistance has been associated with the mutations at dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and dihydrofolatereductase (dhfr) genes. This study investigated antifolate drug resistance at the molecular level. A total of 249 fever cases from Arunachal Pradesh, NE India, were screened for malaria, and of these, 75 were found to be positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Samples were sequenced and analysed with the help of BioEdit and ClustalW. Three novel point mutations were found in the dhps gene with 10 haplotypes along with the already reported mutations. A single haplotype having quadruple mutation was found in the dhfr gene. The study reports higher degree of antifolate drug resistance as evidenced by the presence of multiple point mutations in dhps and dhfr genes. The findings of this study strongly discourage the use SP as a partner drug in ACT.

TI Natural Plasmodium vivax infections in Anopheles mosquitoes in a malaria
   endemic area of northeastern Thailand
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB There was recently an outbreak of malaria in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeastern Thailand. In the absence of information on malaria vector transmission dynamics, this study aimed to identify the anopheline vectors and their role in malaria transmission. Adult female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected monthly by human-landing catch in Na Chaluai District of Ubon Ratchathani Province during January 2014-December 2015. Field-captured mosquitoes were identified to species using morphology-based keys and molecular assays (allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, AS-PCR), and analysed for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circumsporozoite proteins (CSP). A total of 1,229 Anopheles females belonging to 13 species were collected. Four anopheline taxa were most abundant: Members of the Anopheles barbirostris complex, comprising 38% of the specimens, species of the Anopheles hyrcanus group (18%), Anopheles nivipes (17%) and Anopheles philippinensis (12%). The other nine species comprised 15% of the collections. Plasmodium infections were detected in two of 668 pooled samples of heads/thoraces, Anopheles dirus (1/29) and An. philippinensis (1/97). The An. dirus pool had a mixed infection of P. vivax-210 and P. vivax-247, whereas the An. philippinensis pool was positive only for the latter protein variant. Both positive ELISA samples were confirmed by nested PCR. This study is the first to incriminate An. dirus and An. philippinensis as natural malaria vectors in the area where the outbreak occurred. This information can assist in designing and implementing a more effective malaria control programme in the province.

TI Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1
   (block 2), glutamate-rich protein and sexual stage antigen Pfs25 from
   Chandigarh, North India
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB OBJECTIVE To elucidate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in residual transmission foci of northern India.
   METHODS Clinically suspected patients with malaria were screened for malaria infection by microscopy. 48 P. falciparum-infected patients were enrolled from tertiary care hospital in Chandigarh, India. Blood samples were collected from enrolled patients, genomic DNA extraction and nested PCR was performed for further species confirmation. Sanger sequencing was carried out using block 2 region of msp1, R2 region of glurp and pfs25-specific primers.
   RESULTS Extensive diversity was found in msp1 alleles with predominantly RO33 alleles. Overall allelic prevalence was 55.8% for RO33, 39.5% for MAD20 and 4.7% for K1. Six variants were observed in MAD20, whereas no variant was found in RO33 and K1 alleles. A phylogenetic analysis of RO33 alleles indicated more similarity to South African isolates, whereas MAD20 alleles showed similarity with South-East Asian isolates. In glurp, extensive variation was observed with eleven different alleles based on the AAU repeats. However, pfs25 showed less diversity and was the most stable among the targeted genes.
   CONCLUSION Our findings document the genetic diversity among circulating strains of P. falciparum in an area of India with low malaria transmission and could have implications for control strategies to reach the national goal of malaria elimination.

TI Sustained Malaria Control Over an 8-Year Period in Papua New Guinea: The
   Challenge of Low-Density Asymptomatic Plasmodium Infections
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The scale-up of effective malaria control in the last decade has resulted in a substantial decline in the incidence of clinical malaria in many countries. The effects on the proportions of asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections and on transmission potential are yet poorly understood.
   Methods. In Papua New Guinea, vector control has been intensified since 2008, and improved diagnosis and treatment was introduced in 2012. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Madang Province in 2006 (with 1280 survey participants), 2010 (with 2117 participants), and 2014 (with 2516 participants). Infections were quantified by highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and gametocytes were quantified by reverse-transcription qPCR analysis.
   Results. Plasmodium falciparum prevalence determined by qPCR decreased from 42% in 2006 to 9% in 2014. The P. vivax prevalence decreased from 42% in 2006 to 13% in 2010 but then increased to 20% in 2014. Parasite densities decreased 5-fold from 2006 to 2010; 72% of P. falciparum and 87% of P. vivax infections were submicroscopic in 2014. Gametocyte density and positivity correlated closely with parasitemia, and population gametocyte prevalence decreased 3-fold for P. falciparum and 29% for P. vivax from 2010 to 2014.
   Conclusions. Sustained control has resulted in reduced malaria transmission potential, but an increasing proportion of gametocyte carriers are asymptomatic and submicroscopic and represent a challenge to malaria control.

TI Improving vector-borne pathogen surveillance: A laboratory-based study
   exploring the potential to detect dengue virus and malaria parasites in
   mosquito saliva
SO JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES
AB Background & objectives: Vector-borne pathogen surveillance programmes typically rely on the collection of large numbers of potential vectors followed by screening protocols focused on detecting pathogens in the arthropods. These processes are laborious, time consuming, expensive, and require screening of large numbers of samples. To streamline the surveillance process, increase sample throughput, and improve cost-effectiveness, a method to detect dengue virus and malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) by leveraging the sugar-feeding behaviour of mosquitoes and their habit of expectorating infectious agents in their saliva during feeding was investigated in this study.
   Methods: Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and P. falciparum infected female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to feed on honey coated Flinders Technical Associates-FTA (R) cards dyed with blue food colouring. The feeding resulted in deposition of saliva containing either DENV-2 particles or P. falciparum sporozoites onto the FTA card. Nucleic acid was extracted from each card and the appropriate real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was run to detect the pathogen of interest.
   Results: As little as one plaque forming unit (PFU) of DENV-2 and as few as 60 P. falciparum parasites deposited on FTA cards from infected mosquitoes were detected via qPCR. Hence, their use to collect mosquito saliva for pathogen detection is a relevant technique for vector surveillance.
   Interpretation & conclusion: This study provides laboratory confirmation that FTA cards can be used to capture and stabilize expectorated DENV-2 particles and P. falciparum sporozoites from infectious, sugar-feeding mosquitoes in very low numbers. Thus, the FTA card-based mosquito saliva capture method offers promise to overcome current limitations and revolutionize traditional mosquito-based pathogen surveillance programmes. Field testing and further method development are required to optimize this strategy.

TI Malaria-causing MSP-1 Plasmodium falciparum Ligation and Transformation
   in Jayapura City
SO MAJALAH KEDOKTERAN BANDUNG-MKB-BANDUNG MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB MSP1 is the most antigenic and expressed protein on merozoite surface when it infects the erythrocytes of malaria patients which leads to its use for vaccine therapy design development. The ligation and transformation process of the MSP1 gene is a gene duplication attempt for producing the same product during expression. This study aimed to clone P. falciparum MSP-1 gene from tropical malaria patients in Jayapura using pJET1.2/blunt vectors and E. coli DH5a competent cells, to get the recombinant plasmid propagation of MSP1 gene. Blood that was positive for P. falciparum was molecularly processed, starting with genomic DNA isolation and then followed by PCR amplification, ligation into pJET1.2/blunt vector, and transformation into E. coli DH5a using the heat shock transformation method. The process was ended with PCR confirmation to confirm MSP1 gene insertion. The results showed that the presence of the MSP1 gene in pJET1.2/blunt was successfully confirmed through PCR. From a total of 10 positive colonies grown in liquid culture, plasmid was isolated. Electropherogram result presented bands of about 1049bp, indicating the presence of the MSP1 gene in plasmid. Hence, MSP1 gene cloning using pJET1.2/ blunt cloning vector and competent cell E. coli DH5a has been successfully performed.

TI Tagging to endogenous genes of Plasmodium falciparum using CRISPR/Cas9
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite. Currently, there are seldom commercial antibodies against P. falciparum proteins, which greatly limits the study on Plasmodium. CRISPR/Cas9 is an efficient genome editing method, which has been employed in various organisms. However, the use of this technique in P. falciparum is still limited to gene knockout, site-specific mutation and generation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter line with disruption of inserted sites.
   Results: We have adapted the CRISPR/Cas9 system to add commercial tag sequences to endogenous genes of P. falciparum. To add HA or HA-TY1 tags to ck2 beta 1, ck2a and stk, pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2 beta 1/ck2a/stk was constructed, which contained sequences of tags, specific homologous arms, and sgRNA. The P. falciparum 3D7 strain was subsequently transfected with pUF1-BSD-Cas9 and pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2 beta 1/ck2a/stk plasmids via electroporation. After that, BSD and WR99210 drugs were added to the culture to screen parasites containing both plasmids. Twenty days after electroporation, live parasites appeared and were collected to check the tagging by PCR, DNA sequencing, Western blotting and immuno-fluorescence assays. The results showed that the tags were successfully integrated into the C-terminus of these three proteins.
   Conclusions: We have improved the method to integrate tags to Plasmodium falciparum genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which lays the foundation for further study of Plasmodium falciparum at the molecular level.

TI Prevalence of malaria in two highly endemic Community Health Centers in
   the Bastar district, Chhattisgarh showing mixed infections with
   Plasmodium species
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria is a major public health problem in India and in the Chhattisgarh state. The diagnosis of malaria presents a major challenge in remote areas The prevalence of malaria in Darbha and Kilepal Community Health Centers (CHCs) of the Jagdalpur district, Chhattisgarh affected by conflict was determined using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the year 2015, 29.4% and 21.5% cases were found to be positive for malaria at the Darbha and Kilepal CHCs, respectively, by microscopy, and 7.4% and 1.6% of cases had mixed infections, respectively. Among the suspected cases of mixed infections and doubtful diagnoses, 21% had mixed infections with two or more species at the Darbha CHC, and 17% from the Kilepal CHC, as determined by PCR. Both the P. vivax subspecies Pv210 (56%) and Pv247 (44%) and the P. ovale curtisi subspecies were found in this area. The high proportion of mixed malaria parasitic infections detected in this study indicate the need to adequately train health staff involved in diagnosing malaria. This study showed that there is a need for site-specific data to understand the epidemiological picture and to develop appropriate intervention strategies and management guidelines for controlling and eliminating malaria in India.

TI Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of
   artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments for uncomplicated
   falciparum malaria in pregnancy: methodological challenges
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: There is no agreed standard method to assess the efficacy of anti-malarials for uncomplicated falciparum in pregnancy despite an increased risk of adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus. The aim of this review is to present the currently available evidence from both observational and interventional cohort studies on antimalarial efficacy in pregnancy and summarize the variability of assessment and reporting found in the review process.
   Methods: Efficacy methodology and assessment of artemisinin-based treatments (ABT) and quinine-based treatments (QBT) were reviewed systematically using seven databases and two clinical trial registries (protocol registration-PROSPERO: CRD42017054808). Pregnant women in all trimesters with parasitologically confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria were included irrespective of symptoms. This review attempted to re-calculate proportions of treatment success applying the same definition as the standard WHO methodology for non-pregnant populations. Aggregated data meta-analyses using data from randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments were performed by random effects model.
   Results: A total of 48 eligible efficacy studies were identified including 7279 treated Plasmodium falciparum episodes. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in 24 studies for differentiating recurrence, the assessment and reporting of treatment efficacy was heterogeneous. When the same definition could be applied, PCR-corrected treatment failure of >= 10% at any time points was observed in 3/30 ABT and 3/7 QBT arms. Ten RCTs compared different combinations of ABT but there was a maximum of two published RCTs with PCR-corrected outcomes for each comparison. Five RCTs compared ABT and QBT. Overall, the risk of treatment failure was significantly lower in ABT than in QBT (risk ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.63), although the actual drug combinations and outcome endpoints were different. First trimester women were included in 12 studies none of which were RCTs of ABT.
   Conclusions: Efficacy studies in pregnancy are not only limited in number but use varied methodological assessments. In five RCTs with comparable methodology, ABT resulted in higher efficacy than QBT in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Individual patient data meta-analysis can include data from observational cohort studies and could overcome some of the limitations of the current assessment given the paucity of data in this vulnerable group.

TI Interleukin-10 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II are
   potential biomarkers of Plasmodium falciparum infections in pregnant
   women: a case-control study from Nanoro, Burkina Faso
SO BIOMARKER RESEARCH
AB Background: Diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy is problematic due to the low sensitivity of conventional diagnostic tests (rapid diagnostic test and microscopy), which is exacerbated due to low peripheral parasite densities, and lack of clinical symptoms. In this study, six potential biomarkers to support malaria diagnosis in pregnancy were evaluated.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from pregnant women at antenatal clinic visits and at delivery. Microscopy and real-time PCR were performed for malaria diagnosis and biomarker analyses were performed by ELISA (interleukin 10, IL-10; tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha; soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II, sTNF-RII; soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, sFlt-1; leptin and apolipoprotein B, Apo-B). A placental biopsy was collected at delivery to determine placental malaria.
   Results: IL-10 and sTNF-RII were significantly higher at all time-points in malaria-infected women (p < 0.001). Both markers were also positively associated with parasite density (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003 for IL-10 and sTNF-RII respectively). IL-10 levels at delivery, but not during pregnancy, were negatively associated with birth weight. A prediction model was created using IL-10 and sTNF-RII cut-off points. For primigravidae the model had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI 45.7-98.7%) and specificity of 83.3% (95% CI 57.1-94.9%) for diagnosing malaria during pregnancy. For secundi- and multigravidae the sensitivity (81.8% and 56.5% respectively) was lower, while specificity (100.0% and 94.3% respectively) was relatively high. Sub-microscopic infections were detected in 2 out of 3 secundi- and 5 out of 12 multigravidae.
   Conclusions: The combination of biomarkers IL-10 and sTNF-RII have the potential to support malaria diagnosis in pregnancy. Additional markers may be needed to increase sensitivity and specificity, this is of particular importance in populations with sub-microscopic infections or in whom other inflammatory diseases are prevalent.

TI A deep sequencing approach to estimate Plasmodium falciparum complexity
   of infection (COI) and explore apical membrane antigen 1 diversity
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Humans living in regions with high falciparum malaria transmission intensity harbour multi-strain infections comprised of several genetically distinct malaria haplotypes. The number of distinct malaria parasite haplotypes identified from an infected human host at a given time is referred to as the complexity of infection (COI). In this study, an amplicon-based deep sequencing method targeting the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was utilized to (1) investigate the relationship between P. falciparum prevalence and COI, (2) to explore the population genetic structure of P. falciparum parasites from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating in the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and (3) to explore selection pressures on geospatially divergent parasite populations by comparing AMA1 amino acid frequencies in the DRC and Mali.
   Results: A total of 900 P. falciparum infections across 11 DRC provinces were examined. Deep sequencing of both individuals, for COI analysis, and pools of individuals, to examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1 haplotypes. The majority of individual infections (64.5%) contained polyclonal (COI > 1) malaria infections based on the presence of genetically distinct pfama1 haplotypes. A minimal correlation between COI and malaria prevalence as determined by sensitive real-time PCR was identified. Population genetic analyses revealed extensive haplotype diversity, the vast majority of which was shared across the sites. AMA1 amino acid frequencies were similar between parasite populations in the DRC and Mali.
   Conclusions: Amplicon-based deep sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of multi-strain infections that can aid in the understanding of antigen heterogeneity of potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of malaria parasites, and factors that influence complex, polyclonal malaria infections. While AMA1 and other diverse markers under balancing selection may perform well for understanding COI, they may offer little geographic or temporal discrimination between parasite populations.

TI Diagnostic accuracy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for
   screening patients with imported malaria in a non-endemic setting
SO PARASITE
AB Background: Sensitive and easy-to-perform methods for the diagnosis of malaria are not yet available. Improving the limit of detection and following the requirements for certification are issues to be addressed in both endemic and non-endemic settings. The aim of this study was to test whether loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) may be an alternative to microscopy or real-time PCR for the screening of imported malaria cases in non-endemic area. Results: 310 blood samples associated with 829 suspected cases of imported malaria were tested during a one year period. Microscopy (thin and thick stained blood slides, reference standard) was used for the diagnosis. Real-time PCR was used as a standard of truth, and LAMP (Meridian Malaria Plus) was used as an index test in a prospective study conducted following the Standards for Reporting Diagnosis Accuracy Studies. In the 83 positive samples, species identification was P. falciparum (n=66), P. ovale (n=9), P. vivax (n=3) P. malariae (n=3) and 2 co-infections with P. falciparum+P. malariae. Using LAMPmethods, 93 samples gave positive results, including 4 false-positives. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for LAMP tests were 100%, 98.13%, 95.51%, and 100% compared to PCR. Conclusion: High negative predictive value, and limit of detection suggest that LAMP can be used for screening of imported malaria cases in non-endemic countries when expert microscopists are not immediately available. However, the rare occurrence of non-valid results and the need for species identification and quantification of positive samples preclude the use of LAMP as a single reference method.

TI The frontline of controlled human malaria infections: A report from the
   controlled human infection models Workshop in Leiden University Medical
   Centre 5 May 2016
SO VACCINE
AB Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) is the most practiced controlled human infection model nowadays and there is an exponential increase in implementation of the model worldwide. During the Controlled Human Infection Models Workshop in Leiden, one day was dedicated to the discussion of the advances made and gaps in Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) trials. Factors contributing to this impressive expansion in the number of CHMI trials have been related to the ability to perform CHMI using injectable cryopreserved sporozoites (a product from Sanaria Inc. - PfSPZ Challenge), the development of a transmission blocking CHMI model and the need to test more vaccine candidates particularly in the field of whole-sporozoite vaccine development. However, with an increasing number of CHMI trials being undertaken, in an ever-growing number of trial sites, heterogeneity in trial design may compromise universal interpretation of results and require an ongoing dialogue on the need and feasibility of standardization. At the workshop, CHMI investigators convened to share their experiences in CHMI trials and discuss the possibilities for future trials.

TI Interaction between environment, nutrient-derived metabolites and
   immunity: A possible role in malaria susceptibility/resistance in Fulani
   and Dogon of Mali
SO PLOS ONE
AB The role of some nutrient-derived metabolites on the innate and adaptive immune responses is now established. Global research approach investigating the interplay between environment, lifestyle and the host's immune responses is crucial in the understanding of malaria susceptibility. Advanced Glycation end products (AGE), which are food-derived metabolites result from the link between reducing sugar and amino group of proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. The level of exposure to AGEs varies depending on the type of diet. The dysfunction of the immune system induced by AGE and the cellular receptors for AGEs (RAGE) in susceptibility to bacterial infection has been described. But no study has yet explored their role in susceptibility to malaria. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate systemic AGE and RAGE gene polymorphism in two sympatric populations with previously described difference of susceptibility to malaria. We measured by ELISA the plasma levels of AGEs, and their soluble receptors (sRAGE) from 170 volunteers (68 Fulani and 102 Dogon). We also determined by real-time quantitative PCR the expression of RAGE, and the -374 T/A, -429 T/C polymorphisms and 63 bp deletion by fragment length restriction polymorphism. The prevalence rate of Plasmodium in Fulani and Dogon were respectively 42.64% and 51.30% for P. falciparum, 5.88% and 6.5% for P. malariae, 0% and 2.6% for P. ovale. The average AGE was 12.65 mu g/ml, and 496.48 pg/ml for sRAGE. Highest levels of sRAGE were observed in Fulani (563,07 pg/ml, 95% CI [547.81 +/- 580.13] vs 465.68 pg/ml, 95% CI [331.19 +/- 467.51]) for Dogon, p = 0.00001. Fulani had the lowest mean of AGE (10.21 mu g/ml, 95% CI [8.02 +/- 10.92]) compared to Dogon (16.88 mu g/ml, 95% CI [13.92 +/- 17.96]; p = 0.00001. RAGE was more expressed in Dogon than Fulani (0.08 vs 0.04), P = 0.08. The -374A polymorphism vas more frequent in Fulani (32%) compared to Dogon (20%). The chronic exposure to dietary AGE could lead to immune responses impairment and polymorphism with implications in malaria susceptibility. More studies are necessary to better investigate this hypothesis.

TI Unexpected high circulation of Plasmodium vivax in asymptomatic children
   from Kedougou, southeastern Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria in Senegal is due essentially to infections by Plasmodium falciparum and, to a lesser extent to Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. By the use of molecular methods, detection of Plasmodium vivax has been recently reported in the region of Kedougou, raising the question of appraisal of its potential prevalence in this setting.
   Methods: A retrospective serological study was carried out using 188 samples taken from 2010 to 2011 in a longitudinal school survey during which 48 asymptomatic children (9-11 years) were recruited. Four collections of samples collected during two successive dry and rainy seasons were analysed for antibody responses to P. vivax and P. falciparum. Recombinant P. falciparum and P. vivax MSP1 antigens and total P. falciparum schizont lysate from African 07/03 strain (adapted to culture) were used for ELISA. Nested PCR amplification was used for molecular detection of P. vivax.
   Results: A surprising high prevalence of IgG responses against P. vivax MSP1 was evidenced with 53% of positive samples and 58% of the individuals that were found positive to this antigen. There was 77% of responders to P. falciparum outlined by 63% of positive samples. Prevalence of responders did not differ as function of seasons. Levels of antibodies to P. falciparum fluctuated with significant increasing between dry and rainy season (P < 0.05), contrary to responses to P. vivax. There was a significant reciprocal relationship (P < 10(-3)) between antibody responses to the different antigens, but with weak coefficient of correlation (Rho around 0.3) underlining a variable profile at the individual level. Clear molecular signature was found in positive IgG to P. vivax msp1 samples by PCR.
   Conclusion: This cross-sectional longitudinal study highlights the unexpected high circulation of P. vivax in this endemic area. Sero-immunology and molecular methods are powerful additive tools to identify endemic sites where relevant control measures have to be settled and monitored.

TI Therapeutic efficacy of artesunate - amiodaquine for treating
   uncomplicated falciparum malaria at Ghindae Zonal Referral Hospital,
   Eritrea
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) which is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Eritrea.
   Materials and methods: The study was conducted from December 2014 to March 2015 in Ghindae Zonal Referral Hospital in Northern Red Sea Zone. Out of 481 patients screened, 103 were enrolled in the study. The therapeutic efficacy test was done as per the WHO protocol for a period of 28 days of follow-up.
   Results: The PCR-uncorrected treatment outcome was classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in 95 patients, which meant the cure rate was 96.0 (95% CI: 89.7%-98.5%) after survival analysis.
   Conclusions: Therapeutic efficacy of AS + AQ still meets the WHO efficacy criteria for its continued use in the study area as the first-line drug against uncomplicated falciparum malaria. However, further studies are needed using correction with molecular markers to monitor therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs in this area.

TI Controlled Human Malaria Infection: Applications, Advances, and
   Challenges
SO INFECTION AND IMMUNITY
AB Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) entails deliberate infection with malaria parasites either by mosquito bite or by direct injection of sporozoites or parasitized erythrocytes. When required, the resulting blood-stage infection is curtailed by the administration of antimalarial drugs. Inducing a malaria infection via inoculation with infected blood was first used as a treatment (malariotherapy) for neurosyphilis in Europe and the United States in the early 1900s. More recently, CHMI has been applied to the fields of malaria vaccine and drug development, where it is used to evaluate products in well-controlled earlyphase proof-of-concept clinical studies, thus facilitating progression of only the most promising candidates for further evaluation in areas where malaria is endemic. Controlled infections have also been used to immunize against malaria infection. Historically, CHMI studies have been restricted by the need for access to insectaries housing infected mosquitoes or suitable malaria-infected individuals. Evaluation of vaccine and drug candidates has been constrained in these studies by the availability of a limited number of Plasmodium falciparum isolates. Recent advances have included cryopreservation of sporozoites, the manufacture of well-characterized and genetically distinct cultured malaria cell banks for blood-stage infection, and the availability of Plasmodium vivax-specific reagents. These advances will help to accelerate malaria vaccine and drug development by making the reagents for CHMI more widely accessible and also enabling a more rigorous evaluation with multiple parasite strains and species. Here we discuss the different applications of CHMI, recent advances in the use of CHMI, and ongoing challenges for consideration.

TI Detection of Plasmodium Species by High-Resolution Melt Analysis of DNA
   from Blood Smears Acquired in Southwestern Uganda
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Microscopic diagnosis of malaria using Giemsa-stained blood smears is the standard of care in resource-limited settings. These smears represent a potential source of DNA for PCR testing to confirm Plasmodium infections or for epidemiological studies of archived samples. Therefore, we assessed the use of DNA extracts from stained blood smears for the detection of Plasmodium species using real-time PCR. We extracted DNA from archived blood smears and corresponding red blood cell pellets collected from asymptomatic children in southwestern Uganda in 2010. We then performed real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting (HRM) to identify Plasmodium species, and we compared our results to those of microscopy. We analyzed a total of 367 blood smears and corresponding red blood cell pellets, including 185 smears (50.4%) that were positive by microscopy. Compared to microscopy, PCR-HRM analysis of smear DNA had a sensitivity of 93.0% (95% confidence interval [ CI], 88.2 to 96.2%) and a specificity of 96.7% (95% CI, 93.0 to 98.8%), and PCR-HRM analysis of pellet DNA had a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI, 98.0 to 100.0%) and a specificity of 94.0% (95% CI, 89.4 to 96.9%). Identification of positive PCR-HRM results to the species level revealed Plasmodium falciparum (92.0%), Plasmodium ovale (5.6%), and Plasmodium malariae (2.4%). PCR-HRM analysis of DNA extracts from Giemsa-stained thick blood smears or corresponding blood pellets had high sensitivity and specificity for malaria diagnosis, compared to microscopy. Therefore, blood smears can provide an adequate source of DNA for confirmation of Plasmodium species infections and can be used for retrospective genetic studies.

TI Plasmodium Detection and Differentiation by Direct-on-Blood PCR Nucleic
   Acid Lateral Flow Immunoassay Development, Validation, and Evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Decreasing malaria transmission warrants the search for highly sensitive point-of-care diagnostics, especially in resource-limited settings. The direct-on-blood PCR nucleic add lateral flow immunoassay (db-PCR-NALFIA) is a simplified PCR-based technique with a lateral flow readout that does not require sample preparation. Two duplex db-PCR-NALFIAs were developed: a pan-Plasmodium/Plasmodium falciparum (pan/P. falciparum) and a pan-Plasmodium/Plasmodium vivax (pan/P. vivax) assay. Confirmed positive samples (n = 61) and negative controls (n = 40) were used for laboratory validations. A prospective field evaluation of the pan/P. falciparum assay was performed in Kenya (n = 300). In the laboratory validation, sensitivity and specificity of the pan/P. falciparum assay were 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 91.2%-100%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the pan/P. vivax assay were 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100%) and 97.5% (95% CI, 86.8%-99.9%), respectively. In Kenya, sensitivity of the pan/P. falciparum db-PCR-NALFIA was 97.2% (95% CI, 93.0%-99.2%) and specificity was 74.2% (95% CI 67.0%-81.0%) compared with reference standard microscopy. When using real-time quantitative PCR as a reference standard, sensitivity was 84.5% (95% CI 78.7%-89.3%) and specificity was 85.4% (95% CI, 77.1%-91.6%). Db-PCR-NALFIA is a sensitive, specific, and easy method for the detection and species differentiation of Plasmodium. This test is especially of interest for malaria control or elimination programs in low-transmission settings that require accurate detection of low parasite densities.

TI Expanding the malaria molecular diagnostic options: opportunities and
   challenges for loop-mediated isothermal amplification tests for malaria
   control and elimination
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Introduction: The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique holds substantial promise as an alternative easy-to-use molecular test for malaria parasite detection. Several modifications to the initial malaria LAMP assay have been made in an effort to make the LAMP platform more field-friendly.Areas covered: A PubMed literature search was performed using the following search terms: malaria,' loop mediated isothermal amplification', LAMP', molecular tests' and diagnostics'. The authors review the currently reported malaria LAMP assays and discuss what requirements would be needed to make malaria LAMP assays field-usable, especially in the context of malaria elimination.Expert commentary: Expanding the malaria LAMP tests as options for use in malaria control programs will require addressing some important challenges such as the need for simplified sample preparation steps; ready to use kits that require no cold chain; the use of a non-subjective results readout and preferably cost-effectiveness. Two malaria LAMP kits are now CE-marked and commercially available: the Loopamp MALARIA kit and the Illumigene malaria LAMP. Malaria LAMP tests, like other molecular tests, will likely be utilized in very specific studies such as: to evaluate detect and treat' strategies; in controlled malaria infection trials or drug efficacy trials and as confirmatory test in reference laboratories.

TI Asymptomatic infections in blood donors harbouring Plasmodium: an
   invisible risk detected by molecular and serological tools
SO BLOOD TRANSFUSION
AB Background. Transfusion-transmitted malaria due to asymptomatic Plasmodium infections is a challenge for blood banks. There is a lack of data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infected blood donors and the incidence of transfusion-transmitted malaria in low endemicity areas worldwide. We estimated the frequency of blood donors harbouring Plasmodium in an area in which asymptomatic infections have been reported.
   Material and methods. To estimate the frequency of blood donors harbouring Plasmodium we used microscopy and molecular tools. Serological tests were applied to measure the exposure of candidates to Plasmodium antigens. Venous blood was collected from 91 candidates attending the "Pro-Sangue" Blood Centre Foundation in Sao Paulo, who lived in the municipality of Juquitiba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where sporadic autochthonous cases of malaria have been described. Blood samples were used for parasitological, molecular and serological studies.
   Results. Among the 91 samples examined, rare Plasmodium forms were observed in two donors. Genus real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated Plasmodium amplification in three candidates and species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction identified P. malariae in two. ELISA-IgG was reactive in 42.9% of samples for P. vivax (Pv-MSP1 19) and in 6.6% for P. falciparum (Pf-Zw). ELISA-IgM was reactive in 2.2% of samples for P. vivax and in 4.4% for P. falciparum. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was reactive for P. malariae in 15.4% of cases.
   Discussion. Reservoirs of Plasmodium represent a challenge for blood banks, since studies have shown that high levels of submicroscopic infections can occur in low transmission areas. The risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria presented here points to the need to conduct molecular investigations of candidate donors with any positive malarial antibody test.

TI Malaria Vaccine Development: The Need for Novel Approaches: A Review
   Article
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: Although rigorous efforts have substantially decreased the malaria burden through decades, it still threatens the lives of millions of children. Development of an effective vaccine can provide important approach in malaria control strategies. Unfortunately, development of an effective vaccine for falciparum malaria has been hindered by the extreme complexity of malaria parasite biology, complex and diverse parasite genomes, and immune evasion by the parasites as well as the intricate nature of the parasites infection cycle. The aim of this review was to discuss the different approaches to malaria vaccine development until now.
   Methods: Scientific databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed) and SCOPUS were searched up to 30 Jan 2017 and the articles regarding malaria vaccine development were taken into examination.
   Results: Several strategies for malaria vaccine development including pre-erythrocytic vaccines, antibody-based subunit vaccines, vectored vaccines, whole sporozoite vaccines, genetically Attenuated parasites and sporozoite subunit vaccine, erythrocytic vaccines, sexual stage vaccine, transmission-blocking vaccine as well as synthetic peptides and conjugate vaccine has been introduced. However, the success has been limited thus far.
   Conclusion: Although development of malaria vaccine over the past 70 year has been continued, the discovery, development, and licensing of a malaria vaccine formulation, which meets safety, affordability, accessibility, applicability, and efficacy has not yet been achieved.

TI Investigation of pregnancy-associated malaria by microscopy, rapid
   diagnostic test and PCR in Bandundu, the Democratic Republic of Congo
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The study was conducted to investigate malaria prevalence among a group of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who received intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP).
   A total of 250 women from Bandundu city who received two doses of IPTp-SP were enrolled in the survey. Blood samples were collected at the time of delivery and malaria prevalence was determined using microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Malaria infection was detected in 81 (32.4%), 93 (37.2%), and 92 (36.8%) samples by microscopy, RDT, and PCR, respectively. Among 92 samples, P. falciparum mono-infection (n=87; 94.5%), P. falciparum+P. vivax (n=2; 2.2%) and P. falciparum+P. malariae (n=1; 1.1%) mixed infections, and P. vivax mono-infection (n=2; 2.2%) were detected. Prevalence of malaria was not affected by age and number of pregnancies (p > 0.05). Microscopy and RDT, either alone (kappa=0.29; p < 0.001) or in combination (kappa=0.33; p < 0.001) showed a fair agreement with PCR.
   Our findings indicate that two doses of IPTp-SP did not protect the women against malaria in the DRC, and support the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that ensure a minimum of three doses of SP in pregnancy.

TI Impact of Sickle Cell Trait and Naturally Acquired Immunity on
   Uncomplicated Malaria after Controlled Human Malaria Infection in Adults
   in Gabon
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by direct venous inoculation (DVI) with 3,200 cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) consistently leads to parasitemia and malaria symptoms in malaria-naive adults. We used CHMI by DVI to investigate infection rates, parasite kinetics, and malaria symptoms in lifelong malaria-exposed (semi-immune) Gabonese adults with and without sickle cell trait. Eleven semi-immune Gabonese with normal hemoglobin (IA), nine with sickle cell trait (IS), and five nonimmune European controls with normal hemoglobin (NI) received 3,200 PfSPZ by DVI and were followed 28 days for parasitemia by thick blood smear (TBS) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for malaria symptoms. End points were time to parasitemia and parasitemia plus symptoms. PfSPZ Challenge was well tolerated and safe. Five of the five (100%) NI, 7/11 (64%) IA, and 5/9 (56%) IS volunteers developed parasitemia by TBS, and 5/5 (100%) NI, 9/11 (82%) IA, and 7/9 (78%) IS by qPCR, respectively. The time to parasitemia by TBS was longer in IA (geometric mean 16.9 days) and IS (19.1 days) than in NA (12.6 days) volunteers (P = 0.016, 0.021, respectively). Five of the five, 6/9, and 1/7 volunteers with parasitemia developed symptoms (P = 0.003, NI versus IS). Naturally adaptive immunity (NAI) to malaria significantly prolonged the time to parasitemia. Sickle cell trait seemed to prolong it further. NAI plus sickle cell trait, but not NAI alone, significantly reduced symptom rate. Twenty percent (4/20) semi-immunes demonstrated sterile protective immunity. Standardized CHMI with PfSPZ Challenge is a powerful tool for dissecting the impact of innate and naturally acquired adaptive immunity on malaria.

TI Prevalence of Asymptomatic Parasitemia and Gametocytemia in HIV-Infected
   Children on Differing Antiretroviral Therapy
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Laboratory data and prior pediatric reports indicate that HIV protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ARV) kills gametocytes and reduces rates of gametocytemia, but not asymptomatic parasitemia, in a high malaria-transmission area. To determine whether ARV regimen impacts these rates in areas with less-intense malaria transmission, we compared asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia rates in HIV-infected children by ARV regimen in Lilongwe, Malawi, an area of low-to-moderate transmission intensity. HIV PI lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV-rtv) ARV-or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine ARV-treated children did not differ in the rates of polymerase chain reaction-detected asymptomatic parasitemia (relative risk [RR] 0.43 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16, 1.18], P value 0.10) or microscopically detected gametocytemia with LPV-rtv ARV during symptomatic malaria (RR 0.4895% CI [0.22,1.04] P value 0.06). LPV-rtv ARV was not associated with reduced rates of asymptomatic parasitemia, or gametocytemia on days of symptomatic malaria episodes, in HIV-infected children. Larger studies should evaluate whether ARV impacts transmission.

TI Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Genetic Variants in Malaria
   Patients in Southwestern Ethiopia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked erythrocyte enzyme disorder with relevance to malaria treatment policy. Treatment with the antimalarial primaquine can result in hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient patients. With increased interest in primaquine use, it is important to identify G6PD variants in Ethiopia to inform malaria treatment policy. In the present study, mutations in the G6PD gene are identified in a sample of patients with malaria in Jimma town in southwest Ethiopia. Plasmodium species of infection were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed to observe a portion of the G6PD gene where the common G6PD mutations (A376G, G202A, and C563T) are found. Molecular analysis revealed that most of the samples were single Plasmodium vivax infections (83.7%). For G6PD genotyping, A376G was detected in 23.26% of individuals, whereas G202A and C563T were absent. Three other uncommon mutations were identified: rs782669677 (535G -> A), rs370658483, (485 + 37 G -> T), and a new mutation at chrX: 154535443(C -> T). Bioinformatic analysis of these mutations' potential functional impact suggests minimal effect on protein function. The discovery of both common and uncommon G6PD mutations contributes to the discussion on G6PD deficiency and appropriate primaquine treatment in Ethiopia.

AB In recent years there has been a global decrease in the prevalence of malaria due to scaling up of control measures, hence global control efforts now target elimination and eradication of the disease. However, a major problem associated with elimination is asymptomatic reservoir of infection especially in endemic areas. This study aims to determine the efficiency of histidine rich protein II (HRP-2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for monitoring transmission intensities in an endemic community in Nigeria during the pre-elimination stage. Plasmodium falciparum asymptomatic malaria infection in healthy individuals and symptomatic cases were detected using HRP-2. RDT negative tests were re-checked by microscopy and by primer specific PCR amplification of merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2) for asexual parasites and Pfs25 gene for gametocytes in selected samples to detect low level parasitemia undetectable by microscopy. The mean age of the study population (n=280) was 6.12 years [95% CI 5.16 - 7.08, range 0.5 - 55], parasite prevalence was 44.6% and 36.3% by microscopy and RDT respectively (p = 0.056). The parasite prevalence of 61.5% in children aged >2 - 10 years was significantly higher than 3.7% rate in adults > 18years (p < 0.0001, chi(2) = 60.45). RDT detected additional 29.6% asymptomatic cases but a lower specificity of 68.8% in symptomatic carriers. In 15 selected RDT positive samples, only 6 were positive by PCR and no gametocyte was detected. The results indicate that HRP-2 RDTs are a vital tool for understanding transmission dynamics and detecting immune-suppressed, recent and asymptomatic infections, thus crucial to tackle low level transmission and eliminating malaria in endemic areas.

TI Molecular surveillance of chloroquine drug resistance markers (pfcrt and
   Pfmdr1) among imported plasmodium falciparum malaria in Qatar
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Imported malaria has been a great challenge for public health in Qatar due to influx of large number of migrant workers. Antimalarial drug resistance has emerged as one of the greatest challenges facing malaria control today. Monitoring parasite haplotypes that predict susceptibility to major antimalarial can guide treatment policies. This study aimed to determine molecular drug resistance pattern in imported malaria cases in Qatar. Blood samples from the uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria patients were collected at Hamad General Hospital, HMC, Doha, Qatar. The samples were further confirmed by nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for P.falciparum. Molecular markers of chloroquine (Pfcrt and Pfmdrl) were analyzed by using nested PCR- RFLP method to determine the key point mutations associated with chloroquine (CQ) drug resistance. A total 118 blood samples were positive for P. falciparum. Overall, by RFLP, 72% harboured wild type allele (N86) of Pfmdr1 gene. The prevalence of Pfcrt mutant (T76), WT (K76) and mixed alleles (K76T) was 63.6% (n = 75), 22.9% (n = 27) and 13.5% (n = 16), respectively Mean parasitaemia level was higher among the wild type alleles of Pfcrt gene as compared to the mixed/mutant alleles whereas mixed alleles of Pfmdr1 gene having high parasitaemia. Molecular surveillance strategy based on imported malaria cases can be used to detect and track CQ drug-resistant malaria. The data presented here might be helpful for enrichment of molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance and will be useful for developing and updating antimalarial guidance for non-immune imported cases in Qatar.

TI Development of Visually Improved Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification
   for the Diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax Malaria in a Tertiary Hospital in
   Chandigarh, North India
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB More than 80% of the global burden of the Plasmodium vivax is contributed by mainly three countries (India, Indonesia, and Pakistan). Reports from last decades have highlighted the occurrence of severe P. vivax malaria which was earlier considered to be benign. The recent trends of increasing P. vivax-associated morbidity and mortality emphasizes the need for early and accurate diagnosis of P. vivax malaria for the timely management of patients. Microscopy is considered a gold standard but needs experienced laboratory technologists. Over the last few years, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is being used as a highly sensitive and specific test but it requires expensive equipment which limits its use in the field. Therefore, in the present study, utility of visually improved loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of P. vivax was evaluated targeting 18SrRNA gene in 145 microscopically confirmed P. vivax and 20 P. vivax negative patients. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP was assessed with respect to microscopy and multiplex nested PCR(nPCR). Results of theLAMPassay was also correlated with rapid diagnostic test, multiplex nPCR and real-timePCR results. Overall, sensitivity and specificity of P. vivax-specific LAMP compared with microscopy were found to be 100% and 85%, respectively. Furthermore, detection limit for LAMP was found to be 0.8 copies/mu L and it was also able to detect three complicated cases of P. vivax which were missed by microscopy. This study showed aLAMPassay to be a rapid and very sensitive method for the early diagnosis of both complicated and uncomplicated P. vivax malaria.

TI Efficiency of a Malaria Reactive Test-and-Treat Program in Southern
   Zambia: A Prospective, Observational Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB To improve malaria surveillance and achieve elimination, the Zambian National Malaria Elimination Program implemented a reactive test-and-treat program in Southern Province in 2013 in which individuals with rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed malaria are followed-up at their home within 1 week of diagnosis. Individuals present at the index case household and those residing within 140 m of the index case are tested with an RDT and treated with artemether-lumefantrine if positive. This study evaluated the efficiency of this reactive test-and-treat strategy by characterizing infected individuals missed by the RDT and the current screening radius. The radius was expanded to 250 m, and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test was performed on dried blood spot specimens. From January 2015 through March 2016, 145 index cases were identified at health centers and health posts. A total of 3,333 individuals residing in 525 households were screened. Excluding index cases, the parasite prevalence was 1.1% byRDT(33 positives of 3,016 participants) and 2.4% by qPCR (73 positives of 3,016 participants). Of the qPCR-positive cases, 62% of 73 individuals tested negative by RDT. Approximately half of the infected individuals resided within the index case household (58% of RDT-positive individuals and 48% of qPCR-positive individuals). The low sensitivity of the RDT and the high proportion of secondary cases within the index case household decreased the efficiency of this reactive test-and-treat strategy. Reactive focal drug administration in index case households would be a more efficient approach to treating infected individuals associated with a symptomatic case.

TI Characterization of Plasmodium Lactate Dehydrogenase and Histidine-Rich
   Protein 2 Clearance Patterns via Rapid On-Bead Detection from a Single
   Dried Blood Spot
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB A rapid, on-bead enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) was adapted for use with dried blood spot (DBS) samples. This assay detected both biomarkers from a single DBS sample with only 45 minutes of total incubation time and detection limits of 600 +/- 500 pM (pLDH) and 69 +/- 30 pM (HRP2), corresponding to 150 and 24 parasites/mu L, respectively. This sensitive and reproducible on-bead detection method was used to quantify pLDH and HRP2 in patientDBS samples from rural Zambia collected at multiple time points after treatment. Biomarker clearance patterns relative to parasite clearance were determined; pLDHclearance followed closely with parasite clearance, whereas most patients maintained detectable levels of HRP2 for 35-52 days after treatment. Furthermore, weak-to-moderate correlations between biomarker concentration and parasite densities were found for both biomarkers. This work demonstrates the utility of the developed assay for epidemiological study and surveillance of malaria.

TI Insights into the Performance of SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan Rapid
   Diagnostic Test and Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 Gene
   Variation in Madagascar
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) forms the basis of many current malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). However, the parasites lacking part or all of the pfhrp2 gene do not express the PfHRP2 protein and are, therefore, not identifiable by PfHRP2-detecting RDTs. We evaluated the performance of the SDB ioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan RDT together with pfhrp2 variation in Madagascar. Genomic DNA isolated from 260 patient blood samples were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified for the parasite 18S rRNA and pfhrp2 genes. Post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA) was performed for the identification of parasite species. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 amplicons were sequenced. Polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of patient samples showed that 29% (75/260) were infected and P. falciparum was present in 95% (71/75) of these PCR-positive samples. Comparing RDT and P. falciparum detection by LDR-FMA, eight samples were RDT negative but P. falciparum positive (false negatives), all of which were pfhrp2 positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT were 87% and 90%, respectively. Seventy-three samples were amplified for pfhrp2, from which nine randomly selected amplicons were sequenced, yielding 13 sequences. Amplification of pfhrp2, combined with RDT analysis and P. falciparum detection by LDR-FMA, showed that there was no indication of pfhrp2 deletion. Sequence analysis of pfhrp2 showed that the correlation between pfhrp2 sequence structure and RDT detection rates was unclear. Although the observed absence of pfhrp2 deletion from the samples screened here is encouraging, continued monitoring of the efficacy of the SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan RDT for malaria diagnosis in Madagascar is warranted.

TI Gametocyte Development and Carriage in Ghanaian Individuals with
   Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes develop over 9-12 days while sequestered in deep tissues. On emergence into the bloodstream, they circulate for varied amounts of time during which certain host factors might influence their further development. We aimed to evaluate the potential association of patient clinical parameters with gametocyte development and carriage via in vivo methods. Seventy-two patients were enrolled from three hospitals in the Volta region of Ghana in 2016. Clinical parameters were documented for all patients, and gametocyte prevalence by microscopy was estimated at 12.5%. By measuring RNA transcripts representing two distinct gametocyte developmental stages using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we obtained a more precise estimate of gametocyte carriage while also inferring gametocyte maturation. Fifty-three percent of the study participants harbored parasites expressing transcripts of the immature gametocyte-specific gene (PF3D7_1477700), whereas 36% harbored PF3D7_1438800 RNA-positive parasites, which is enriched in mid and mature gametocytes, suggesting the presence of more immature stages. Linear logistic regression showed that patients older than 5 years but less than 16 years were more likely to carry gametocytes expressing both PF3D7_1477700 and PF3D7_1438800 compared with younger participants, and gametocytemia was more likely in mildly anemic individuals compared with those with severe/moderate anemia. These data provide further evidence that a greater number of malaria patients harbor gametocytes than typically estimated by microscopy and suggest a possible association between age, fever, anemia, and gametocytemia.

TI Low Frequency of Asymptomatic and Submicroscopic Plasmodial Infections
   in Uraba Region in Colombia
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Background. A screening for malaria parasites was conducted with asymptomatic residents in Colombia. Methods. A descriptive study was carried out in December 2012 in four municipalities of Urab a region in Colombia. A convenience sample of 400 subjects was selected. Participants responded to a survey regarding epidemiological data and blood samples were taken from capillary blood obtained by finger prick for thick smear, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. 399 subjects aged 0.2-98 years were studied (median 22; 221 female (55%)). Episodes of malaria in the last year confirmed by thick film were reported by 47 participants (12%). In 399 samples tested by RDT 4 (1%) were positive (1 with P. falciparum, 3 with P. vivax), and 3 were confirmed by PCR. In 399 thick blood smears examined 5 (1.3%) were positive (2 with P. falciparum, 3 with P. vivax), and 3 were confirmed by PCR. In 227 samples, PCR showed 6 (2.6%) positive samples. The parasitaemia was below 1,440 parasites/mu L. The best agreement between diagnoses was found between the RDT and thick blood smears (Kappa = 0.75). Conclusion. Plasmodial afebrile infection was found in 2% of the studied population, by three diagnostic methods, in residents from a low endemic malaria region in Colombia.

TI Using Reference Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction to Assess the
   Clinical Performance of the Paracheck-Pf (R) Rapid Diagnostic Test in a
   Field Setting in Uganda
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used in clinical and surveillance settings. However, the performance of most RDTs has not been characterized at parasite densities below detection by microscopy. We present findings from Uganda, where RDT results from 491 participants with suspected malaria were correlated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-defined parasitemia. Compared with qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT for Plasmodium falciparum mono-infections were 76% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68-83%) and 95% (95% CI: 92-97%), respectively. The sensitivity of the RDT at parasite densities between 0.2 and 200 parasites/mu L was surprisingly high (87%, 95% CI: 74-94%). The high sensitivity of the RDT is likely because of histidine-rich protein 2 from submicroscopic infections, gametocytes, or sequestered parasites. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating different RDTsin field studies against qPCR reference testing to better define the sensitivity and specificity, particularly at low parasite densities.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Although falciparum malaria is an important risk among travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, many travelers remain unaware of this risk. In October 2015, we found a cluster of imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases among Thai gem mine workers in Nigeria; none had received malaria chemoprophylaxis or information regarding malaria risk. The index case developed fever and visited our hospital on arrival day in Thailand after his 3-week stay in Nigeria. Plasmodium falciparum was found in his blood. He recovered completely 3 days post-admission. After we requested he contact his colleagues in Nigeria regarding malaria risk, we found that three of his five colleagues currently had fever, were diagnosed with malaria, and were being treated in a local hospital. Two were successfully treated in Nigeria. Although their blood films were negative for malaria, we could confirm that they recently had malaria because the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was still positive for P. falciparum. Tragically, the last febrile case died in Nigeria 6 days post-admission, after developing jaundice and alteration of consciousness. The two colleagues without fever symptoms were also tested by PCR, which was negative for malaria. In conclusion, we found that four of six workers had malaria in this cluster, which was equal to 66.7% attack rate. There is an urgent need to raise awareness of malaria among workers in highly endemic areas. Clinical practice for travelers who are ill on their return should not only focus on individual cases but also consider potential disease clusters.

TI Status of Artemisinin Resistance in Malaria Parasite Plasmodium
   falciparum from Molecular Analyses of the Kelch13 Gene in Southwestern
   Nigeria
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Evolution and spread of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum capable of evading antimalarials are the prime concern tomalaria control. The currently effective drug, artemisinin (ART), is under threat due to detection of ART-resistant P. falciparum parasites in the Southeast Asian countries. It has been shown that amino acid (AA) mutations at the P. falciparum Kelch13 (Pfk13) gene provide resistance to ART. Nigeria, a part of the Sub-Saharan Africa, is highly endemic to malaria, contributing quite significantly to malaria, and resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination drugs has already been reported. Since artemisinin combined therapy (ACT) is the first-line drug for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Nigeria and five amino acid mutations have been validated in the Pfk13 gene alongside with candidate mutations for ART resistance, we performed molecular surveillance for mutations (following PCR and DNA sequence analyses) in this gene from two southwestern states of Nigeria. Statistical analyses of DNA sequences were also performed following different evolutionary models. None of the different validated and candidate AA mutations of Pfk13 gene conferring resistance to ART could be detected in P. falciparum sampled in the two southwestern states of Nigeria. In addition, DNA sequencing and sequence analyses indicated neither evolutionary selection pressure on the Pfk13 gene nor association of mutations in Pfk13 gene with mutations of other three genes conferring resistance to CQ and SP. Therefore, based on the monomorphism at the Pfk13 gene and nonassociation of mutations of this gene with mutations in three other drug-resistant genes in malaria parasite P. falciparum, it can be proposed that malaria public health is not under immediate threat in southwestern Nigeria concerning ART resistance.

AB Malaria is a major health problem in tropical countries including Indonesia. The most deadly agent is Plasmodium falciparum. In P. falciparum infection, PfEMP1 is supposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria. PfEMP1 is encoded by var gene family, it is a polymorphic protein where the extra-cellular portion contains of three distinct binding domains: Duffy binding-like (DBL), Cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDR) and C2. PfEMP1 varies in domain composition and binding specificity. The study explored the characteristic of Indonesian DBL2 beta-var genes and investigated its role to the malaria outcome. Twenty blood samples from clinically mild to severe malaria patients in Jember, East Java were collected for DNA extraction. Diagnosis was confirmed by Giemsa-stained thick blood smear. PCR was conducted using specific primer targeting on the full-length of DBL2 beta and resulted approximately single band of 1,7 kb in a sample. This band was observed only from severe malaria sample. Sequence analysis directly from PCR product showed 74-99% similarities with previous sequences in Gene Bank. In conclusion, the DBL2 beta domain of vargene of Indonesian isolates was 1603 nucleotides in length and there was a possible association of the existence of DBL2 beta domain with the severity of malaria outcome.

TI Malaria parasite clearance from patients following artemisinin-based
   combination therapy in Cote d'Ivoire
SO INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB Introduction: Parasite clearance is useful to detect artemisinin resistance. The aim o f this study was to investigate parasite clearance in patients treated with artesunate + amodiaquine (AS + AQ) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL): the two artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) recommended in the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Cote d'Ivoire.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Bouake, Cote d'Ivoire, from April to June 2016. Patients aged at least 6 months with uncomplicated malaria and treated with AS + AQ or AL were hospitalized for 3 days, and follow-up assessments were performed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Blood smears were collected at the time of screening, pre-dose, and 6-hour intervals following the first dose of administration until two consecutive negative smears were recorded, thereafter at day 3 and follow-up visits. Parasite clearance was determined using the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network's parasite clearance estimator. The primary end points were parasite clearance rate and time.
   Results: A total of 120 patients (57 in the AS + AQ group and 63 in the AL group) were randomized among 298 patients screened. The median parasite clearance time was 30 hours (IQR, 24-36 hours), for each ACT The median parasite clearance rate had a slope half-life of 2.36 hours (IQR, 1.85-2.88 hours) and 2.23 hours (IQR, 1.74-2.63 hours) for AS + AQ and A L, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response was 100% and 98.07% at day 42 for AS + AQ and AL, respectively.
   Conclusion: Patients treated with AS + AQ and AL had cleared parasites rapidly. ACTs are still efficacious in Bouake, Cote d'Ivoire, but continued efficacy monitoring of ACTs is needed.

TI Genetic Diversity of the Plasmodium falciparum Glutamate-Rich Protein R2
   Region Before and Twelve Years after Introduction of Artemisinin
   Combination Therapies among Febrile Children in Nigeria
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The genetic diversity of glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) R2 region in Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected before and 12 years after the introduction of artemisinin combination treatment of malaria in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria, was compared in this study. Blood samples were collected on filter paper in 2004 and 2015 from febrile children from ages 1-12 years. The R2 region of the GLURP gene was genotyped using nested polymerase chain reaction and by nucleotide sequencing. In all, 12 GLURP alleles were observed in a total of 199 samples collected in the two study years. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) marginally increased over the two study years; however, the differences were statistically insignificant (2004 samples MOI = 1.23 versus 2015 samples MOI = 1.47). Some alleles were stable in their prevalence, whereas two GLURP alleles, VIII and XI, showed considerable variability between both years. This variability was replicated when GLURP sequences from other regions were compared with ours. The expected heterozygosity (He) values (He = 0.87) were identical for the two groups. High variability in the rearrangement of the amino acid repeat units in the R2 region were observed, with the amino acid repeat sequence DKNEKGQHEIVEVEEILPE more prevalent in both years, compared with the two other repeat sequences observed in the study. The parasite population characterized in this study displayed extensive genetic diversity. The detailed genetic profile of the GLURP R2 region has the potential to help guide further epidemiological studies aimed toward the rational design of novel chemotherapies that are antagonistic toward malaria.

TI Therapeutic Response to Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for P. falciparum
   and P. vivax Nine Years after Its Introduction in Southern Papua,
   Indonesia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) has been the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections in Papua, Indonesia, since March 2006. The efficacy of DHP was reassessed to determine whether there had been any decline following almost a decade of its extensive use. An open-label drug efficacy study of DHP for uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria was carried out between March 2015 and April 2016 in Timika, Papua, Indonesia. Patients with uncomplicated malaria were administered supervised DHP tablets once daily for 3 days. Clinical and laboratory data were collected daily until parasite clearance and then weekly for 6 weeks. Molecular analysis was undertaken for all patients with recurrent parasitemia. A total of 129 study patients were enrolled in the study. At day 42, the polymerase chain reaction-adjusted efficacy was 97.7% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 87.4-99.9) in the 61 patients with P. falciparum malaria, and 98.2% [95% CI: 90.3-100] in the 56 patients with P. vivax malaria. By day 2,98%(56/57) of patients with P. falciparum and 96.9% (63/65) of those with P. vivax had cleared their peripheral parasitemia; none of the patients were still parasitaemic on day 3. Molecular analysis of P. falciparum parasites showed that none (0/61) had K13 mutations associated previously with artemisinin resistance or increased copy number of plasmepsin 2-3 (0/61). In the absence of artemisinin resistance, DHP has retained high efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria despite extensive drug pressure over a 9-year period.

TI Efficacy of Artemisinin-Based Combination Treatments of Uncomplicated
   Falciparum Malaria in Under-Five-Year-Old Nigerian Children Ten Years
   Following Adoption as First-Line Antimalarials
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The efficacies of 3-day regimens of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (AA), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) were evaluated in 910 children < 5 years old with uncomplicated malaria from six geographical areas of Nigeria. Parasite positivity 1 day and Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of persistent parasitemia 3 days after therapy initiation were both significantly higher, and geometric mean parasite reduction ratio 1 day after treatment initiation (PRRD1) was significantly lower in AL-treated children than in AA-and DHP-treated children. No history of fever, temperature > 38 degrees C, enrollment parasitemia > 75,000 mu L-1, and PRRD1 < 5,000 independently predicted persistent parasitemia 1 day after treatment initiation. Parasite clearance was significantly faster and risk of reappearance of asexual parasitemia after initial clearance was significantly lower in DHP-treated children. Overall, day 42 polymerase chain reaction-corrected efficacy was 98.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.1-100) and was similar for all treatments. In a non-compartment model, declines of parasitemias were monoexponential with mean terminal elimination half-life of 1.3 hours and unimodal frequency distribution of half-lives. All treatments were well tolerated. In summary, all three treatments evaluated remain efficacious treatments of uncomplicated malaria in young Nigerian children, but DHP appears more efficacious than AL or AA.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Controlled human malaria infections (CHMIs) with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) parasites are well established. Exposure to five Pf (NF54)-infected Anopheles mosquitoes results in 100% infection rates in malaria-naive volunteers. Recently Pf clones NF135.C10 and NF166.C8 were generated for application in CHMIs. Here, we tested the clinical infection rates of these clones, using graded numbers of Pf-infected mosquitoes. In a double-blind randomized trial, we exposed 24 malaria-naive volunteers to bites from one, two, or five mosquitoes infected with NF135.C10 or NF166.C8. The primary endpoint was parasitemia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. For both strains, bites by five infected mosquitoes resulted in parasitemia in 4/4 volunteers; 3/4 volunteers developed parasitemia after exposure to one or two infected mosquitoes infected with either clone. The prepatent period was 7.25 +/- 4.0 days (median +/- range). There were no serious adverse events and comparable clinical symptoms between all groups. These data confirm the eligibility of NF135.C10 and NF166.C8 for use in CHMI studies.

TI Case Report: Plasmodium knowlesi Infection with Rhabdomyolysis in a
   Japanese Traveler to Palawan, the Philippines
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Skeletal muscle is known to be damaged by falciparum malaria via sequestration of infected erythrocytes. We present a case of rhabdomyolysis caused by Plasmodium knowlesi infection. The patient had fever, myalgia, and muscle weakness 5 days after returning to Japan from Palawan, the Philippines. Blood test revealed thrombocytopenia and an elevated creatine kinase level. Although rhabdomyolysis resolved with fluid therapy, fever of 24-hour cycle continued and thrombocytopenia intensified. On day 7 of illness, Giemsa-stained thin blood smear revealed malaria parasites, with a parasite count of 2,380/mu L, which were morphologically indistinguishable between P. knowlesi and Plasmodium malariae. Rapid diagnostic test showed a negative result. The pathogen was later confirmed to be P. knowlesi by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was successfully treated with artemether/lumefantrine. This case suggests that knowlesi malaria might be able to cause skeletal muscle damage.

TI Molecular Detection of Residual Parasitemia after
   Pyronaridine-Artesunate or Artemether-Lumefantrine Treatment of
   Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in Kenyan Children
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Artemisinin resistance is rapidly rising in Southeast Asia and may spread to African countries, where efficacy estimates are currently still excellent. Extensive monitoring of parasite clearance dynamics after treatment is needed to determine whether responsiveness to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) is changing in Africa. In this study, Kenyan children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to pyronaridine-artesunate (PA) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment. Parasite clearance was evaluated over 7 days following the start of treatment by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and direct-on-blood PCR nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (db-PCR-NALFIA), a simplified molecular malaria diagnostic. Residual parasitemia at day 7 was detected by qPCR in 37.1% (26/70) of AL-treated children and in 46.1% (35/76) of PA-treated participants (P = 0.275). Direct-on-blood PCR nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay detected residual parasites at day 7 in 33.3% (23/69) and 30.3% (23/76) of AL and PA-treated participants, respectively (P = 0.692). qPCR-determined parasitemia at day 7 was associated with increased prevalence and density of gametocytes at baseline (P = 0.014 and P = 0.003, for prevalence and density, respectively) and during follow-up (P = 0.007 and P = 0.011, respectively, at day 7). A positive db-PCR-NALFIA outcome at day 7 was associated with treatment failure (odds ratio [OR]: 3.410, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.513-7.689, P = 0.003), but this association was not found for qPCR (OR: 0.701, 95% CI: 0.312-1.578, P = 0.391). Both qPCR and db-PCR-NALFIA detected substantial residual submicroscopic parasitemia after microscopically successful PA and AL treatment and can be useful tools to monitor parasite clearance. To predict treatment outcome, db-PCR-NALFIA may be more suitable than qPCR.

AB Although Plasmodium vivax has been assumed to be absent from sub-Saharan Africa because of the protective mutation conferring the Duffy-negative phenotype, recent evidence has suggested that P. vivax cases are prevalent in these regions. We selected 292 dried blood spots from children who participated in the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to assess for P. vivax infection. Four P. vivax infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction, each in a geographically different survey cluster. Using these as index cases, we tested the remaining 73 samples from the four clusters. With this approach, 10 confirmed cases, three probable cases, and one possible case of P. vivax were identified. Among the 14 P. vivax cases, nine were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum. All 14 individuals were confirmed to be Duffy-negative by sequencing for the single point mutation in the GATA motif that represses the expression of the Duffy antigen. This finding is consistent with a growing body of literature that suggests that P. vivax can infect Duffy-negative individuals in Africa. Future molecular and sequencing work is needed to understand the relationship of these isolates with other P. vivax samples from Asia and South America and discover variants linked to P. vivax virulence and erythrocyte invasion.

TI Case Report: Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance is
   Associated with Loa loa Infection
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB A 63-year-old woman who migrated from Nigeria to the United States was found to have an elevated total serum protein, anemia, and eosinophilia. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis (SPIFE) demonstrated monoclonal immunoglobulin G(IgG). restricted bands (IgG 3,820 mg/dL;./. ratio 4.47), indicative of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria was positive for Plasmodium falciparum (BinaxNOW (R); Alere Scarborough Inc., Scarborough, ME). Giemsa-stained blood smears were negative for malarial parasites, however, Loa loa microfilariae were identified. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for P. falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium vivax yielded a negative result. She was treated for loiasis with diethylcarbamazine and received no malaria medication. Treatment resulted in a resolution of the microfilaremia and eosinophilia, a negative RDT for malaria, and marked reduction in the monoclonal gammopathy. This is the first reported human case of MGUS associated with loiasis and its resolution after antiparasitic treatment.

TI Molecular Surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum Drug Resistance Markers
   in Clinical Samples from Botswana
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major threat to global malaria control and elimination efforts. In Botswana, a southern African country approaching malaria elimination, P. falciparum molecular data are not available. Parasites were assessed through pollymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmation of positive rapid diagnostic tests, multiplicity of infection (MOI), and drug resistance markers among isolates from clinical uncomplicated malaria cases collected at health facilities. Of 211 dried blood spot samples selected for the study, 186 (88.2%) were PCR positive for P. falciparum. The mean MOI based on MSP1 genotyping was 2.3 and was not associated with age. A high prevalence of wild-type parasites for pfcrt and pfmdr1 was found, with a haplotype frequency (K76/N86) of 88.8% and 17.7% of the isolates having two copies of the pfmdr1 gene. For pfATPase6, all the parasites carried the wild-type S769 allele. Sequencing showed no evidence of non-synonymous mutations associated with reduced artemisinin derivative sensitivity in the P. falciparum k13 gene. In conclusion, we found that P. falciparum parasites in Botswana were mostly wild type for the drug resistance markers evaluated. Yet, there was a high rate of a molecular marker associated to reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine. Our results indicate the need for systematic drug efficacy surveillance to complement malaria elimination efforts.

TI Absence of Plasmodium falciparum K13 Propeller Domain Polymorphisms
   among Field Isolates Collected from the Brazilian Amazon Basin between
   1984 and 2011
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Artemisinin resistance, presently confined to Southeast Asia and associated with mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum K13 (PfK13) propeller domain, represents a serious threat to global malaria control. This study aimed to provide baseline information for future artemisinin resistance surveillance, by analyzing the PfK13 propeller domain in P. falciparum field isolates collected from the Brazilian Amazon Basin between 1984 and 2011. A total of 152 P. falciparum mono-infections were assessed, of which 118 (78%) were collected before and 34 (22%) after the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2006. An 849-base pair fragment encoding the PfK13 propeller was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in both directions. The sequences were compared with the reference sequence of P. falciparum 3D7. All samples showed wild-type sequences, thus, no mutations were observed. The results are in agreement with other recent reports and do not provide evidence for presence of PfK13 propeller domain polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance among P. falciparum field isolates in the Brazilian Amazon Basin neither before nor after the implementation of ACT.

TI Detection of SNPs of T2DM susceptibility genes by a ligase detection
   reaction fluorescent nanosphere technique
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Objective: To establish a high throughput, low cost, and simple nanotechnology-based method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Methods: Multiplex ligase detection reaction (LDR) amplification was performed using fluorescently labeled magnetic nanosphere-bound upstream LDR probes and downstream probes labeled with a unique fluorescent group for each SNP locus. The amplified LDR products were separated by magnetic nanospheres and then scanned by fluorescence spectroscopy. Four SNP loci associated with T2DM were detected, including the rs13866634 locus in SLC30A8, rs10811661in CDKN2A/2B, rs1111875 in the HHEX gene, and rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene. The SNP genotype was also determined by DNA sequencing as a control.
   Results: The SNP genotypes of the four gene loci determined by the nanosphere-based multiplex LDR method were consistent with the DNA sequencing results. The accuracy rate was 100%.
   Conclusion: A method based on multiplex PCR and LDR was established for simultaneous detection of four SNP loci of T2DM susceptibility genes.

   Open-Label, Multicenter Study of a New Water-Dispersible Pediatric
   Formulation of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for the Treatment of
   Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in African Infants
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Artemisinin combination therapies are considered the mainstay of malaria treatment, but pediatric-friendly formulations for the treatment of infants are scarce. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new dispersible-tablet formulation of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine phosphate (DHA/PQP) in comparison to the marketed tablet (Eurartesim) in the treatment of infants with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Reported here are the results of a large phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial conducted in African infants (6 to 12 months of age) from Mozambique, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. Primary efficacy endpoint was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28. Analysis was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. A total of 201 patients received the dispersible-tablet formulation, and 99 received the conventional one administered as crushed tablets. At day 28, the PCR-corrected ACPRs were 86.9% (ITT) and 98.3% (PP) in the dispersible-tablet group and 84.9% (ITT) and 100% (PP) in the crushed-tablet group. At day 42, these values were 85.9% (ITT) and 96.5% (PP) in the dispersible-tablet group and 82.8% (ITT) and 96.4% (PP) in the crushed-tablet group. The comparison between survival curves for time to new infections showed no statistically significant differences (P = 0.409). The safety and tolerability profile for the two groups was similar in terms of type and frequency of adverse events and was consistent with that expected in African infants with malaria. A standard 3-day treatment with the new dispersible DHA/PQP formulation is as efficacious as the currently used tablet in African infants and has a comparable safety profile.

TI Blood-Stage Plasmodium Berghei ANKA Infection Promotes Hepatic Fibrosis
   by Enhancing Hedgehog Signaling in Mice
SO CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Background/Aims: Malaria is the most deadly parasitic infection in the world, resulting in damage to various organs, including the liver, of the infected organism; however, the mechanism causing this damage in the liver remains unclear. Liver fibrosis, a major characteristic of liver diseases, occurs in response to liver injury and is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling orchestrates a number of hepatic responses including hepatic fibrogenesis. Therefore, we investigated whether Hh signaling influenced the liver's response to malarial infection. Methods: Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice inoculated with blood containing Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected erythrocytes were sacrificed when the level of parasitemia in the blood reached 10% or 30%, and the livers were collected for biochemical analysis. Liver responses to PbA infection were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blot. Results: Severe hepatic injury, such as ballooned hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilatation, and infiltrated leukocytes, was evident in the livers of the malaria-infected mice. Hypoxia was also induced in 30% parasitemia group. With the accumulation of Kupffer cells, inflammation markers, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, were significantly upregulated in the infected group compared with the control group. Expression of fibrotic markers, including transforming growth factor-beta alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen 1a1, thymosin beta 4, and vimentin, were significantly higher in the infected groups than in the control group. With increased collagen deposition, hepatic stellate cells expressing a-SMA accumulated in the liver of the PbA-infected mice, whereas those cells were rarely detected in the livers of the control mice. The levels of Hh signaling and Yes-associated protein (YAP), two key regulators for hepatic fibrogenesis, were significantly elevated in the infected groups compared with the control group. Treatment of mice with Hh inhibitor, GDC-0449, reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis with Hh suppression in PbA-infected mice. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that HSCs are activated in and Hh and YAP signaling are associated with this process, contributing to increased hepatic fibrosis in malaria-infected livers.

TI Primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines for reducing Plasmodium falciparum
   transmission
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   The 8-aminoquinoline (8AQ) drugs act on Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, which transmit malaria from infected people to mosquitoes. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine (PQ) be added to malaria treatment schedules in low-transmission areas or those with artemisinin resistance. This replaced the previous recommendation of 0.75 mg/kg, aiming to reduce haemolysis risk in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, common in people living in malarious areas. Whether this approach, and at this dose, is effective in reducing transmission is not clear.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of single dose or short-course PQ (or an alternative 8AQ) alongside treatment for people with P falciparum malaria.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICRTP) portal using 'malaria*', 'falciparua, 'primaquine', '8-aminoquinoline', and eight 8AQ drug names as search terms. We checked reference lists of included trials, and contacted researchers and organizations. Date of last search: 21 July 2017.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in children or adults, adding PQ (or alternative 8AQ) as a single dose or short course alongside treatment for P falciparum malaria.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors screened abstracts, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We sought evidence on transmission (community incidence), infectiousness (people infectious and mosquitoes infected), and potential infectiousness (gametocyte measures assessed by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). We grouped trials into artemisinin and non-artemisinin treatments, and stratified by PQ dose (low, 0.2 to 0.25 mg/kg; moderate, 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg; high, 0.75 mg/kg). We used GRADE, and absolute effects of infectiousness using trial control groups.
   Main results
   We included 24 RCTs and one quasi-RCT, comprising 43 arms. Fourteen trials evaluated artemisinin treatments (23 arms), nine trials evaluated non-artemisinin treatments (13 arms), and two trials included both artemisinin and non-artemisinin arms (three and two arms, respectively). Two trial arms used bulaquine. Seven PQ arms used low dose (six with artemisinin), 11 arms used moderate dose (seven with artemisinin), and the remaining arms used high dose. Fifteen trials tested for G6PD status: 11 excluded participants with G6PD deficiency, one included only those with G6PD deficiency, and three included all, irrespective of status. The remaining 10 trials either did not test or did not report on testing.
   No cluster trials evaluating community effects on malaria transmission met the inclusion criteria.
   With artemisinin treatment
   Low dose PQ
   Infectiousness (participants infectious to mosquitoes) was reduced (day 3 or 4: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.88, 3 trials, 105 participants; day 8: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.58, 4 trials, 243 participants; low certainty evidence). This translates to a reduction in percentage of people infectious on day 3 or 4 from 14% to 2%, and, for day 8, from 4% to 1%; the waning infectiousness in the control group by day 8 making the absolute effect smaller by day 8. For gametocytes detected by PCR, there was little or no effect of PQ at day 3 or 4 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; 3 trials, 414 participants; moderate certainty evidence); with reduction at day 8 (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.65; 4 trials, 532 participants; high certainty evidence). Severe haemolysis was infrequent, with or without PQ, in these groups with few G6PD-deficient individuals (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.39; 4 trials, 752 participants, moderate certainty evidence).
   Moderate dose PQ
   Infectiousness was reduced (day 3 or 4: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.94; 3 trials, 109 participants; day 8 RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57; 4 trials, 246 participants; low certainty evidence). Illustrative risk estimates for moderate dose were the same as low dose. The pattern and level of certainty of evidence with gametocytes detected by PCR was the same as low dose, and severe haemolysis was infrequent in both groups.
   High dose PQ
   Infectiousness was reduced (day 4: RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.68, 1 trial, 101 participants; day 8: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.41, 2 trials, 181 participants, low certainty evidence). The effects on gametocyte prevalence showed a similar pattern to moderate and low dose PQ. Trials did not systematically report evidence of haemolysis.
   With non-artemisinin treatment
   Trials with non-artemisinin treatment have been conducted only for moderate and high dose PQ. With high dose, infectiousness appeared markedly reduced on day 5 (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; 30 participants, very low certainty evidence), with similar reductions at day 8. For both moderate dose (two trials with 221 people) and high dose (two trials with 30 people), reduction in gametocytes (detected by microscopy) showed similar patterns as for artemisinin treatments, with little or no effect at day 4 or 5, and larger effects by day 8. No trials with non-artemisinin partner drugs systematically sought evidence of severe haemolysis.
   Two trials comparing bulaquine with PQ suggest bulaquine may have larger effects on gametocytes by microscopy on day 8 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66; 2 trials, 112 participants).
   Authors' conclusions
   A single low dose of PQ (0.25 mg/kg) added to artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria reduces infectiousness of people to mosquitoes at day 3-4 and day 8, and appears as effective as higher doses. The absolute effect is greater at day 3 or 4, and smaller at day 8, in part because of the lower infectiousness in the control group. There was no evidence of increased haemolysis at 0.25 mg/kg, but few G6PD-deficient individuals were included in the trials. The effect on infectiousness precedes the effect of PQ on gametocyte prevalence. We do not know whether single dose PQ could reduce malaria transmission at community level.

TI Selecting analytical biomarkers for diagnostic applications: a first
   principles approach
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Introduction: Biomarkers are objective indications of a medical state that can be measured accurately and reproducibly. Traditional biomarkers enable diagnosis of disease through detection of disease-specific molecules, disease-mediated molecular changes, or distinct physiological or anatomical signatures.
   Areas covered: This work provides a framework for selecting biomarkers that are most likely to provide useful information about a patient's disease state. Though the authors emphasize markers related to disease, this work is also applicable to biomarkers for monitoring physiological changes such as ovulation or pregnancy. Additionally, the scope was restricted to biomarkers that are amenable to analytical detection across a range of health care levels, including low resource settings. The authors describe trade-offs between biomarkers' sensitivity/specificity for a disease-causing agent, the complexity of detection, and how this knowledge can be applied to the development of diagnostic tests. This report also details additional assessment criteria for successful tests.
   Expert commentary: Biomarker selection should primarily be driven by an attempt to answer an explicit clinical question (preferably causative relationship of the biomarker to disease-state), and only then by test development expediency (ease of detection). This framework is useful for stakeholders from test developers to clinicians to identify the trade-offs for diagnostic biomarkers for any use case.

TI Nyssorhynchus dunhami: bionomics and natural infection by Plasmodium
   falciparum and P. vivax in the Peruvian Amazon
SO MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB BACKGROUND Nyssorhynchus dunhami, a member of the Nuneztovari Complex, has been collected in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru and described as zoophilic. Although to date Ny. dunhami has not been documented to be naturally infected by Plasmodium, it is frequently misidentified as other Oswaldoi subgroup species that are local or regional malaria vectors.
   OBJECTIVES The current study seeks to verify the morphological identification of Nuneztovari Complex species collected in the peri-Iquitos region of Amazonian Peru, to determine their Plasmodium infection status, and to describe ecological characteristics of their larval habitats.
   METHODS We collected Ny. nuneztovari s.l. adults in 2011-2012, and Ny. nuneztovari s.l. larvae and adults in 2016-2017. When possible, samples were identified molecularly using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode sequencing. Adult Ny. nuneztovari s.l. from 2011-2012 were tested for Plasmodium using real-time PCR. Environmental characteristics associated with Ny. nuneztovari s.l. larvae-positive water bodies were evaluated.
   FINDINGS We collected 590 Ny. nuneztovari s.l. adults and 116 larvae from eight villages in peri-Iquitos. Of these, 191 adults and 111 larvae were identified by COI sequencing; all were Ny. dunhami. Three Ny. dunhami were infected with P. falciparum, and one with P. vivax, all collected from one village on one night. Ny. dunhami larvae were collected from natural and artificial water bodies, and their presence was positively associated with other Anophelinae larvae and amphibians, and negatively associated with people living within 250m.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Of Nuneztovari Complex species, we identified only Ny. dunhami across multiple years in eight periIquitos localities. This study is, to our knowledge, the first report of natural infection of molecularly identified Ny. dunhami with Plasmodium. We advocate the use of molecular identification methods in this region to monitor Ny. dunhami and other putative secondary malaria vectors to more precisely evaluate their importance in malaria transmission.

TI High prevalence of dihydrofolate reductase gene mutations in Plasmodium
   falciparum parasites among pregnant women in Nigeria after reported use
   of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB This study assesses the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia positivity and P.falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) mutations in parasite isolates among pregnant women in Southwest Nigeria. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was confirmed by microscopy and nested PCR in 200 pregnant women attending antenatal care. The prevalence of pfdhfr polymorphisms was determined by direct sequencing of the gene fragments containing the C50R, N51l, C59R, S108N, and I164L mutations. Information on the use of antimalarial drugs and methods applied to prevent malaria were obtained by a questionnaire. The prevalence of asymptomatic P falciparum infection was 30% (60/200). The frequency of the pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles (N51l, C59R, and S108N) was 63% (38/60); none of the isolates carried the I164L mutation Among the investigated pregnant women, 40% used un-prescribed antimalarials such as dihydroartemisinin (18%), chloroquine (14%) or pyrimethamine (9%), while only 20.5% used sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for prevention and 39.5% did not use any drug. The prevalence of P falciparum parasitemia (37%) was higher among pregnant women who had not taken any antimalarial drugs. A significant difference in the prevalence of the pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles was observed among women who took SP (90%) compared to those who did not take any drug (82%) and women who took dihydroartemisinin (67%) p = 0.007). Poor adherence to the World Health Organisation (WHO) strategies for malaria prevention among pregnant women was observed in addition to high prevalence of pfdhfr mutations These findings underline the need to improve control of malaria among pregnant women in the study area.

TI Utility of pf/pan RDT for diagnosis in the prevention of
   re-establishment o f malaria in Sri Lanka
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB The utility of CareStart (TM) Malaria Pf/PAN (HRP2/pLDH) Ag Combo Test, in detecting non-endemic clinical malaria cases was evaluated in Sri Lanka, a country in prevention of reestablishment of malaria following elimination. RDT, microscopy and nested PCR were performed for 350 suspected malaria patients recruited prospectively. There were 173 PCR confirmed malaria patients and 177 PCR negative subjects. Plasmodium falciparum amounted to 48% of infections with 44% P. vivax, 6% P. ovale and 2% P. malariae. Performance characteristics of RDTs and microscopy were compared with nested PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of RDT with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were as follows: any malaria infection 95.95% (CI = 91.84-98.36) and 94.92% (CI = 90.57-97.65); P. falciparum 100% (CI = 95.65-100) and 97.00% (CI = 94.18-98.70) and other species 92.22% (CI = 84.63-96.82) and 99.62% (97.88-99.99) respectively. A significant difference between sensitivities of HRP2 (100%, CI = 95.65-100) and pan pLDH line (68.67%, CI = 57.56-78.41) was seen for P. falciparum, parasite densities less than 1000 parasites/microliter being detected only by HRP2. Sensitivity and specificity of microscopy with 95% CI were as follows: any malaria infection, 94.22% (CI = 89.63-97.19) and 99.44% (CI = 96.89-99.99); P. falciparum 89.16% (CI = 80.40-94.90) and 99.63% (CI = 97.94-99.99); other species 98.89% (CI = 93.96-99.97) and 100% (CI = 98.59-100) respectively. The low sensitivity of pan specific pLDH for P. falciparum, P. ovale and P. malariae should be taken in to consideration when using this RDT as a point of care test when and wherever microscopy facilities are not readily available. Considering the low sensitivity of microscopy for P. falciparum, it is preferable to perform both tests, when malaria is highly suspected.

TI Antimalarial Activity of Piperine
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Malaria remains a public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinins in Southeast Asia is a great concern for disease control and research on discovery and development of new alternative antimalarial drugs is urgently required. In a previous study, the fruit of Piper chaba Hunt. was demonstrated to exhibit promising antimalarial activity against the asexual stage of 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive) and K1 (chloroquine-resistant) P. falciparum clones. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the antimalarial activity of piperine, the major isolated constituent of Piper chaba Hunt. fruits against both P. falciparum clones. The antimalarial activity was determined using SYBR green-I-based assay and morphological change was observed under the light microscope with Giemsa staining. The median IC50 (concentration that inhibits parasite growth by 50%) values of piperine against 3D7 and K1 P. falciparum were 111.5 and 59 M, respectively. A marked change in parasite morphology was observed within 48 hours of piperine exposure. Results of real-time PCR showed no effect of piperine on modulating the expression of the three genes associated with antimalarial drug resistance in P. falciparum, i.e., pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfmrp1. Piperine could be a promising candidate for further development as an antimalarial drug based on its antimalarial potency and low risk of resistance development.

TI Genetic Diversity in Merozoite Surface Protein.1 of Plasmodium
   falciparum in Highlands: Wamena Papua Indonesia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Malaria is the first killer as well as endemic disease in highland, lowland and coastal areas of Papua. In 2016 there were 160 thousands cases noted and 80% of the cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Total sample for this study were provided by a clinical trial conducted from May to June 2018 in the regional hospital of Puncak Jaya, Wamena, located in the highland region of Papua. Positive blood samples was collected in a ethylene diaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) tube. DNA was extracted using method of Geneaid Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Blood/Cultured Cell). The primary reactions used a set of primer corresponding to the conserved regions of block 2 of msp1. The second reactions primer set targets specific allelic families of msp1 (K1, MAD20 and RO33). All polymerase chain reaction amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel. A total of 26 blood samples of positive P. falciparum were analyzed, 24 (93.2%) were successfully amplified for msp1. The MAD20 allelic family was predominant with 20.8% (8/24), followed by the RO33 allelic family with 8.2% (2/24) and the K1 allelic family with 1/24 (4.2%). The frequency of single allele is 11/24 (45.8%) while multi-allele are 16/24 (66.7%) with K1/RO33, MAD20/RO33, K1/MAD20/RO33 respectively 2/24 (8.3%), 8/24 (33.3%) and 6/24 (25%).

TI Submicroscopic malaria cases play role in local transmission in
   Trenggalek district, East Java Province, Indonesia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Trenggalek district is a hypoendemic malaria area with mainly imported cases brought by migrant workers from islands outside Java. During malaria surveillance in 2015, no malaria cases were found microscopically, but some cases were positive by PCR. Therefore, a study was conducted to prove that local malaria transmission still occur.
   Methods: The adult villagers were invited to the house of the head of this village to be screened for malaria using aseptic venipuncture of 1 mL blood upon informed consent. Thin and thick blood films as well as blood spots on filter paper were made for each subject. The blood films were stained with Giemsa and the blood spots were used to extract DNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to determine the malaria infection. In addition, the history of malaria infection and travel to malaria endemic areas were recorded. Entomologic survey to detect the existence of anopheline vector was also conducted.
   Results: Of the total 64 subjects that participated in the survey, no malaria parasites were found through microscopic examination of the blood films. The PCR analysis found six positive cases (two Plasmodium falciparum, one Plasmodium vivax and two mixed infection of both species), and two of them had no history of malaria and have never travelled to malaria endemic area. Entomologic survey using human bait trap detected the existence of Anopheles indefinitus that was found to be positive for P. vivax by PCR.
   Conclusions: The results indicated that although we did not find any microscopically slide positive cases, six PCR positive subjects were found. The fact that 2 of the 6 malaria positive subjects have never travelled to malaria endemic area together with the existence of the vector confirm the occurence of local transmission of malaria in the area.

TI Status of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Kwale County,
   Coastal Kenya
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The strategy for malaria vector control in the context of reducing malaria morbidity and mortality has been the scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets to universal coverage and indoor residual spraying. This has led to significant decline in malaria transmission. However, these vector control strategies rely on insecticides which are threatened by insecticide resistance. In this study the status of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors and it's implication in malaria transmission at the Kenyan Coast was investigated.
   Results: Using World Health Organization diagnostic bioassay, levels of phenotypic resistance to permethrin and deltamethrin was determined. Anopheles arabiensis showed high resistance to pyrethroids while Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles funestus showed low resistance and susceptibility, respectively. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) mosquitoes were further genotyped for L1014S and L1014F kdr mutation by real time PCR. An allele frequency of 1.33% for L1014S with no L1014F was detected. To evaluate the implication of pyrethroid resistance on malaria transmission, Plasmodium falciparum infection rates in field collected adult mosquitoes was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and further, the behaviour of the vectors was assessed by comparing indoor and outdoor proportions of mosquitoes collected. Sporozoite infection rate was observed at 4.94 and 2.60% in An. funestus s.l. and An. gambiae s.l., respectively. A higher density of malaria vectors was collected outdoor and this also corresponded with high Plasmodium infection rates outdoor.
   Conclusions: This study showed phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids and low frequency of L1014S kdr mutation in An. gambiae s.l. The occurrence of phenotypic resistance with low levels of kdr frequencies highlights the need to investigate other mechanisms of resistance. Despite being susceptible to pyrethroids An. funestus s.l. could be driving malaria infections in the area.

TI Dynamics of anti-MSP3 and Pfs230 antibody responses and multiplicity of
   infection in asymptomatic children from southern Ghana
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: During a Plasmodium infection, exposure of human host immune cells to both the asexual and the sexual stages of the parasite elicit immune responses. These responses may be protective and prevent the development of high parasitaemia and its associated clinical symptoms, or block the transmission of malaria to an uninfected person. This study aimed at examining the dynamics of naturally acquired immune responses against the asexual and sexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum as well as assessing differences in the multiplicity of infection (MOI) in asymptomatic Ghanaian children living in two communities with varying malaria transmission intensities.
   Methods: School children aged between 6 and 12 years were recruited from Obom, a high malaria prevalence setting and Abura, a low malaria prevalence setting and enrolled in monthly multiple cross sectional surveys between February and May 2015. Filter paper blood blots (DBS) as well as thick and thin blood smears were made from finger-pricked blood at each visit. Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence was determined by microscopy and PCR. Serum eluted from the DBS were used to assess anti-Pfs230 (sexual stage) and anti-MSP3 (asexual stage) antibody levels using indirect ELISA and DNA extracted from the DBS used to assess MOI.
   Results: Malaria parasite point prevalence and MOI throughout the study was higher in Obom than Abura. The trend of parasite prevalence estimated by microscopy was similar to that determined by PCR in Obom but not in Abura. The trend of MSP3 antibody seroprevalence followed that of PCR-estimated parasite prevalence in Obom, while in Abura the trend of Pfs230 antibody seroprevalence followed that of PCR-estimated parasite prevalence.
   Conclusions: Microscopy can more accurately predict changes in parasite prevalence in high transmission settings than low transmission settings. In high transmission settings, P. falciparum parasite prevalence can predict antibody seroprevalence to MSP3, whilst in low transmission settings, seroprevalence against Pfs230 may be a useful predictor of parasite prevalence.

TI Assessment of the quality and quantity of naturally induced antibody
   responses to EBA175RIII-V in Ghanaian children living in two communities
   with varying malaria transmission patterns
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Recent global reports on malaria suggest significant decrease in disease severity and an increase in control interventions in many malaria endemic countries, including Ghana. However, a major driving force sustaining malaria transmission in recent times is the asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites, which can enhance immune responses against parasite antigens. This study determined the prevalence and relative avidities of naturally induced antibodies to EBA175RIII-V-Ll in asymptomatic children living in two communities with varying malaria transmission patterns.
   Methods: An asexual stage Plasmodium falciparum antigen, EBA175RIII-V-Ll was expressed in Lactococcus lactis, purified and used in indirect ELISA to measure total and cytophilic IgG concentrations and avidities in children aged between 6 and 12 years. The children were selected from Obom and Abura, communities with perennial and seasonal malaria transmission, respectively. Venous blood samples were collected in July and October 2015 and again in January 2016. The multiplicity of infection and the genetic diversity of EBA175RIII circulating in both sites were also assessed using polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Asymptomatic parasite carriage in the children from Obom decreased from July (peak season), through October and January, however parasite carriage in children from Abura was bimodal, with the lowest prevalence estimated in October. Antibody concentrations over the course of the study remained stable within each study site however, children living in Obom had significantly higher EBA175RIII-V-Ll antibody concentrations than children living in Abura (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Over the course of the study, the relative antibody avidities of EBA175RIII-V-Ll IgG antibodies were similar within and between the sites.
   Conclusion: Naturally acquired IgG concentrations but not relative antibody avidities to EBA175RIII-V were significantly higher in Obom where malaria transmission is perennial than in Abura, where malaria transmission is seasonal.

TI Molecular identification of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in
   malaria infected women who received intermittent preventive treatment in
   the Democratic Republic of Congo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Point mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps) genes which confer resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) occur at increasing rates. The present study aimed to identify Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutations in P. falciparum isolates recovered from women who received two doses of SP during pregnancy in Bandundu, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
   Methods: A total of 48 women with confirmed P. falciparum infection were enrolled in the study. Finger-prick blood samples that were collected on filter paper at the time of delivery were used for DNA isolation. Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were amplified by a nested PCR protocol. DNA sequencing was performed on both strands, and the point mutations were analysed.
   Results: All of the 48 (100.0%) P. falciparum isolates carried at least one polymorphism in both genes. The wild-type haplotypes of Pfdhfr (CNCSI [C50, N51, C59, S108, I164]) and Pfdhps (SAKAA [S436, A437, K540, A581, A613]) were not observed in the study. In Pfdhfr, N51I (85.4%), C59R (60.4%), and S108N (100.0%) polymorphisms were detected. Triple mutation (CIRNI) (mutant amino acids are underlined) was the most prevalent (47.9%) Pfdhfr haplotype. In the study, all P. falciparum isolates (100.0%) harboured the A437G allele in Pfdhps gene. Also, K540E and A581G polymorphisms were observed in one (2.1%) isolate. Single mutant haplotype (SGKAA) was detected in 97.9% of the isolates. Mutant Pfdhfr and Pfdhps allele combinations revealed quintuple (CICNI-SGEGA; 2.1%), quadruple (CIRNI-SGKAA; 47.9%), triple (CICNI-SGKAA; 35.4%, CNRNI-SGKAA; 12.5%), and double (CNCNI-SGKAA; 2.1%) haplotypes.
   Conclusions: In the study, the rate of SGEGA haplotype was low (2.1%). Although K540E and A581G alleles are more common in Eastern Africa, a distinct lineage of SGEGA is also present in the DRC, which is located in Central Africa. This haplotype is associated with decreased efficacy of SP in pregnant women and infants, therefore, it should be carefully considered in the DRC and SP resistance should be routinely monitored.

TI Increased Susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum in Infants is
   associated with Low, not High, Placental Malaria Parasitemia
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Risk of malaria in infants can be influenced by prenatal factors. In this study, the potential for placental parasitemia at delivery in predicting susceptibility of infants to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infections was evaluated. Seventy-two newborns of mothers who were placental malaria negative (PM-) and of mothers who were PM+ with below (PM+Lo) and above (PM + Hi) median placental parasitemia, were actively monitored during their first year of life. Median time to first PCR-detected Pf infection was shorter in PM + Lo infants (2.8 months) than in both PM-infants (4.0 months, p = 0.002) and PM + Hi infants (4.1 months, p = 0.01). Total number of new infections was also highest in the PM + Lo group. Only 24% of infants experienced clinical malaria episodes but these episodes occurred earlier in PM + Lo infants than in PM + Hi infants (p = 0.05). The adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of having Pf infection was 3.9 (1.8-8.4) and 1.5 (0.7-3.4) for infants in the PM + Lo and PM + Hi groups, respectively. Collectively, low placental parasitemia was associated with increased susceptibility to malaria during infancy. Therefore, malaria in pregnancy preventive regimens, such as sulfadoxine-pyremethamine, that reduce but do not eliminate placental Pf in areas of drug resistance may increase the risk of malaria in infants.

TI Diagnostic challenges of prolonged post-treatment clearance of
   Plasmodium nucleic acids in a pre-transplant autosplenectomized patient
   with sickle cell disease
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Autosplenectomy, as a result of sickle cell disease, is an important risk factor for severe malaria. While molecular methods are helpful in providing rapid and accurate infection detection and species identification, the effect of hyposplenism on result interpretation during the course of infection should be carefully considered.
   Case presentation: A 32-year old autosplenectomized Nigerian male with severe sickle cell disease was referred to the National Institutes of Health for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Despite testing negative for malaria by both smear and PCR 2 weeks after arrival in the USA, the patient developed fever and diffuse bilateral lower rib cage and upper abdominal pain 2 weeks later and subsequently tested positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Parasitaemia was tracked over time by microscopy and nucleic acid tests to evaluate the therapeutic response in the setting of hyposplenism. The patient showed prompt resolution of patent infection by microscopy but remained positive by molecular methods for >30 days after treatment initiation.
   Conclusion: While molecular testing can provide sensitive Plasmodium nucleic acid detection, the persistence of Plasmodium nucleic acids following adequate treatment in functionally asplenic patients can lead to a diagnostic dilemma. In such patients, clinical response and peripheral blood smears should guide patient management following treatment. Nonetheless, in pre-transplant patients at high-risk for pre-existing Plasmodium infections, highly sensitive molecular assays can be useful to rule out infection prior to transplantation.

TI Assessing drug efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum liver stages in
   vivo
SO JCI INSIGHT
AB Malaria eradication necessitates new tools to fight the evolving and complex Plasmodium pathogens. These tools include prophylactic drugs that eliminate Plasmodium liver stages and consequently prevent clinical disease, decrease transmission, and reduce the propensity for resistance development. Currently, the identification of these drugs relies on in vitro P. falciparum liver stage assays or in vivo causal prophylaxis assays using rodent malaria parasites; there is no method to directly test in vivo liver stage activity of candidate antimalarials against the human malaria-causing parasite P. falciparum. Here, we use a liver-chimeric humanized mouse (FRG huHep) to demonstrate in vivo P. falciparum liver stage development and describe the efficacy of clinically used and candidate antimalarials with prophylactic activity. We show that daily administration of atovaquone-proguanil (ATQ-PG; ATQ, 30 mg/kg, and PG, 10 mg/kg) protects 5 of 5 mice from liver stage infection, consistent with the use in humans as a causal prophylactic drug. Single-dose primaquine (60 mg/kg) has similar activity to that observed in humans, demonstrating the activity of this drug (and its active metabolites) in FRG huHep mice. We also show that DSM265, a selective Plasmodial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor with causal prophylactic activity in humans, reduces liver stage burden in FRG huHep mice. Finally, we measured liver stage-to-blood stage transition of the parasite, the ultimate readout of prophylactic activity and measurement of infective capacity of parasites in the liver, to show that ATQ-PG reduces blood stage patency to below the limit of quantitation by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The FRG huHep model, thus, provides a platform for preclinical evaluation of drug candidates for liver stage causal prophylactic activity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies, and biological studies to investigate the mechanism of action of liver stage active antimalarials.

TI Genetic diversity of three surface protein genes in Plasmodium malariae
   from three Asian countries
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Genetic diversity of the three important antigenic proteins, namely thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), and 6-cysteine protein (P48/45), all of which are found in various developmental stages of Plasmodium parasites is crucial for targeted vaccine development. While studies related to the genetic diversity of these proteins are available for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, barely enough information exists regarding Plasmodium malariae. The present study aims to demonstrate the genetic variations existing among these three genes in P. malariae by analysing their diversity at nucleotide and protein levels.
   Methods: Three surface protein genes were isolated from 45 samples collected in Thailand (N = 33), Myanmar (N = 8), and Lao PDR (N = 4), using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Then, the PCR products were sequenced and analysed using BioEdit, MEGA6, and DnaSP programs.
   Results: The average pairwise nucleotide diversities (pi) of P. malariae trap, ama1, and p48/45 were 0.00169, 0.00413, and 0.00029, respectively. The haplotype diversities (Hd) of P. malariae trap, ama1, and p48/45 were 0.919, 0.946, and 0.130, respectively. Most of the nucleotide substitutions were non-synonymous, which indicated that the genetic variations of these genes were maintained by positive diversifying selection, thus, suggesting their role as a potential target of protective immune response. Amino acid substitutions of P. malariae TRAP, AMA1, and P48/45 could be categorized to 17, 20, and 2 unique amino-acid variants, respectively. For further vaccine development, carboxyl terminal of P48/45 would be a good candidate according to conserved amino acid at low genetic diversity (pi= 0.2-0.3).
   Conclusions: High mutational diversity was observed in P. malariae trap and ama1 as compared to p48/45 in P. malariae samples isolated from Thailand, Myanmar, and Lao PDR. Taken together, these results suggest that P48/45 might be a good vaccine candidate against P. malariae infection because of its sufficiently low genetic diversity and highly conserved amino acids especially on the carboxyl end.

TI High Plasmodium Infection Rate and Reduced Bed Net Efficacy in Multiple
   Insecticide-Resistant Malaria Vectors in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic
   of Congo
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Accounting for approximately 11% of all malaria cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is central to malaria elimination efforts. To support vector control interventions in DRC, we characterized the dynamics and impact of insecticide resistance in major malaria vectors in 2015. High Plasmodium infection rates were recorded in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, with Plasmodium falciparum predominant over Plasmodium malariae. Both mosquito species exhibited high and multiple resistance to major public health insecticide classes. The extremely high resistance to permethrin and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in An. gambiae (low mortalities after 6 hours exposure) is worrisome, and is supported by a reduced insecticidal effect of bed nets against both mosquito species in laboratory tests. Metabolic and target site insensitivity mechanisms are driving this resistance in An. gambiae, but only the former was observed in An. funestus. These findings highlight the urgent need for actions to prolong the effectiveness of insecticide- based interventions in DRC.

TI Identification and characterization of areas of high and low risk for
   asymptomatic malaria infections at sub-village level in Ratanakiri,
   Cambodia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria elimination needs a concentration of activities towards identification of residual transmission foci and intensification of efforts to eliminate the last few infections, located in so-called 'malaria hotspots'. Previous work on characterizing malaria transmission hotspots has mainly focused on falciparum malaria and especially on symptomatic cases, while the malaria reservoir is expected to be mainly concentrated in the asymptomatic human population when transmission is low. For Plasmodium vivax, there has been less effort in identifying transmission hotspots. The main aim of this study was to uncover micro-epidemiological mechanisms of clustering of malaria infections at a sub-village level, based on geographical or behavioural features.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed in three villages within the highest malaria endemic province of Cambodia. The survey took place in the dry season, when the malaria reservoir is expected to be low and residing in the asymptomatic part of the population. Village and field locations of households were georeferenced, blood samples were taken from as many residents as possible and a short questionnaire probing for individual risk factors was taken. Asymptomatic malaria carriers were detected by PCR, and geographical clustering analysis (SaTScan) as well as risk factor analysis were performed.
   Results: A total of 1540 out of 1792 (86%) individuals were sampled. Plasmodial DNA was detected in 129 individuals (8.4%). P. vivax was most prevalent (5.5%) followed by Plasmodium malariae (2.1%) and Plasmodium falciparum (1.6%). Mixed infection occurred in 12 individuals. In two out of three villages geographical clustering of high and low malaria infection risk was clearly present. Cluster location and risk factors associated with the infection differed between the parasite species. Age was an important risk factor for the combined Plasmodium infections, while watching television at evenings was associated with increased odds of P. vivax infections [ OR (CI): 1.86 (0.95-3.64)] and bed net use was associated with reduced odds of P. falciparum infections [OR (CI): 0.25 (0.077-0.80)].
   Conclusions: Clusters of malaria carriers were malaria species specific and often located remotely, outside village centres. As such, at micro-epidemiological level, malaria is not a single disease. Further unravelling the micro-epidemiology of malaria can enable programme managers to define the interventions likely to contribute to halt transmission in a particular hotspot location.

TI Molecular characterization of Babesia microti thioredoxin (BmTrx2) and
   its expression patterns induced by antiprotozoal drugs
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Human babesiosis is an infectious disease that is epidemic in various regions all over the world. The predominant causative pathogen of this disease is the intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesia microti. The thioredoxin system is one of the major weapons that is used in the resistance to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by host immune system. In other intra-erythrocytic apicomplexans like the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, anti-oxidative proteins are promising targets for the development of anti-parasitic drugs. However, to date, the sequences and biological properties of thioredoxins and thioredoxin-like molecules of B. microti remain unknown. Understanding the molecular characterization and function of B. microti thioredoxins may help to develop anti-Babesia drugs and controlling babesiosis.
   Methods: The full-length B. microti thioredoxin 2 (BmTrx2) gene was obtained using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, and the deduced BmTrx2 amino acid sequence was analyzed using regular bioinformatics tools. Recombinant BmTrx2 protein was expressed in vitro and purified using His-tag protein affinity chromatography resins. Reverse transcription PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression and native proteins of BmTrx2. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to localize BmTrx2 in B. microti. Bovine insulin reduction assays were used to determine the enzyme activity of the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein.
   Results: The full-length BmTrx2 was 564 bp with a 408 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 135 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of the protein was 15.5 kDa. A conserved thioredoxin-like family domain was found in BmTrx2. The expression of BmTrx2 was upregulated on both the third and eighth day post-infection in mice, whereas expression was downregulated during the beginning and later stages. The results of Western blot analysis showed the native BmTrx2 in parasite lysates could be detected by mouse anti-BmTrx2 serum and that the recombinant BmTrx2 protein could be recognized by serum of B. microti-infected mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that BmTrx2 localized in the cell cytoplasm of B. microti merozoites in B. microti-infected red blood cells. The results of bovine insulin reduction assay indicated the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein possesses antioxidant enzyme activity. Dihydroartemisinin and quinine, known anti-malaria drugs, and clindamycin, a known anti-babesiosis drug, induced significantly higher upregulation of BmTrx2 mRNA.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that BmTrx2 is a functional enzyme with antioxidant activity and may be involved in the response of B. microti to anti-parasite drugs.

TI Artemether-Lumefantrine Versus Chloroquine for the Treatment of
   Uncomplicated Plasmodium knowlesi Malaria: An Open-Label Randomized
   Controlled Trial CAN KNOW
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Plasmodium knowlesi is reported increasingly across Southeast Asia and is the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia. No randomized trials have assessed the comparative efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for knowlesi malaria.
   Methods. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 3 district hospitals in Sabah, Malaysia to compare the efficacy of AL against chloroquine (CQ) for uncomplicated knowlesi malaria. Participants were included if they weighed > 10 kg, had a parasitemia count < 20 000/mu L, and had a negative rapid diagnostic test result for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2. Diagnosis was confirmed by means of polymerase chain reaction. Patients were block randomized to AL (total target dose, 12 mg/kg for artemether and 60 mg/kg for lumefantrine) or CQ (25 mg/kg). The primary outcome was parasite clearance at 24 hours in a modified intention-to-treat analysis.
   Results. From November 2014 to January 2016, a total of 123 patients (including 18 children) were enrolled. At 24 hours after treatment 76% of patients administered AL (95% confidence interval [CI], 63%-86%; 44 of 58) were aparasitemic, compared with 60% administered CQ (47%-72%; 39 of 65; risk ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0-1.6]; P = .06). Overall parasite clearance was shorter after AL than after CQ (median, 18 vs 24 hours, respectively; P = .02), with all patients aparasitemic by 48 hours. By day 42 there were no treatment failures. The risk of anemia during follow-up was similar between arms. Patients treated with AL would require lower bed occupancy than those treated with CQ (2414 vs 2800 days per 1000 patients; incidence rate ratio, 0.86 [95% CI,.82-.91]; P <.001). There were no serious adverse events.
   Conclusions. AL is highly efficacious for treating uncomplicated knowlesi malaria; its excellent tolerability and rapid therapeutic response allow earlier hospital discharge, and support its use as a first-line artemisinin-combination treatment policy for all Plasmodium species in Malaysia.

AB Background: Blackwater fever is a complication of malaria infection consisting of a syndrome of febrile intra-vascular haemolysis with severe anaemia and intermittent passage of dark-red to black colour urine. Despite numerous reports and studies of this condition, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.
   Case presentation: This report describes a case of classic blackwater fever in a returning traveller, without prior history of malaria infection nor usage of anti-malarial prophylaxis, treated with two courses of oral artemether-lumefantrine combination therapy. Unusual persistence of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was detected by PCR for 18 days after initiation of treatment.
   Conclusion: To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported occurrence of a case of blackwater fever associated with prolonged submicroscopic parasitaemia. This unusual case challenges the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this condition and opens questions that may have important diagnostic and treatment implications.

TI Seasonal and inter-annual variation of malaria parasite detection in
   wild chimpanzees
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Cross-sectional surveys of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities across sub-Saharan Africa show large geographical variation in malaria parasite (Plasmodium spp.) prevalence. The drivers leading to this apparent spatial heterogeneity may also be temporally dynamic but data on prevalence variation over time are missing for wild great apes. This study aims to fill this fundamental gap.
   Methods: Some 681 faecal samples were collected from 48 individuals of a group of habituated chimpanzees (Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire) across four non-consecutive sampling periods between 2005 and 2015.
   Results: Overall, 89 samples (13%) were PCR-positive for malaria parasite DNA. The proportion of positive samples ranged from 0 to 43% per month and 4 to 27% per sampling period. Generalized Linear Mixed Models detected significant seasonal and inter-annual variation, with seasonal increases during the wet seasons and apparently stochastic inter-annual variation. Younger individuals were also significantly more likely to test positive.
   Conclusions: These results highlight strong temporal fluctuations of malaria parasite detection rates in wild chimpanzees. They suggest that the identification of other drivers of malaria parasite prevalence will require longitudinal approaches and caution against purely cross-sectional studies, which may oversimplify the dynamics of this host-parasite system.

TI Drug resistance genes: pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1 polymorphism in patients from
   malaria endemic South Western Coastal Region of India
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is highly prevalent in many parts of India and is mostly caused by the parasite species Plasmodium vivax followed by Plasmodium falciparum. Chloroquine (CQ) is the first-line treatment for blood stage P.vivax parasites, but cases of drug resistance to CQ have been reported from India. One of the surveillance strategies which is used to monitor CQ drug resistance, is the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the associated gene markers. Susceptibility to CQ can also be determined by copy number assessment of multidrug resistant gene (mdr-1). The current study has examined the prevalence of SNPs in P.vivax orthologs of P.falciparum chloroquine resistant and multi-drug resistant genes (pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1, respectively) and pvmdr-1 copy number variations in isolates from the highly endemic Mangaluru city near the South Western Coastal region of India.
   Methods: A total of 140 blood samples were collected from P.vivax infected patients attending Wenlock Hospital Mangaluru during July 2014 to January 2016. Out of these 140 samples, sequencing was carried out for 54 (38.5%) and 85 (60.7%) isolates for pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1 genes were analysed by direct sequencing method, while copy number variations of 60 isolates (42.8%) were determined by real time PCR.
   Results: Out of 54 clinical isolates analysed for pvcrt-o, three (5.6%) showed K10 insertion and the rest had wild type sequence. This is the first report to show K10 insertion in P.vivax isolates from India. Further, out of 85 clinical isolates of P.vivax analysed for mutations in pvmdr-1 gene, only one isolate had wild type sequence (similar to 1%) while the remaining (99%) carried mutant alleles. Seven non-synonymous mutations with two novel mutations (I946V and Y1028C) were observed. Of all the observed mutations in pvmdr-1 gene, T958M was most highly prevalent (present in 90% of samples) followed by F1076L (76%), and Y976F (7%). Amplification of pvmdr-1 gene was observed in 31.6% of the isolates, out of 60 amplified.
   Conclusion: The observed variations both in pvmdr-1 and pvcrt-o genes indicate a trend towards parasite acquiring CQ resistance in this endemic area.

TI The importance of morphological identification of African anopheline
   mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) for malaria control programmes
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The correct identification of disease vectors is the first step towards implementing an effective control programme. Traditionally, for malaria control, this was based on the morphological differences observed in the adults and larvae between different mosquito species. However, the discovery of species complexes meant that genetic tools were needed to separate the sibling species and today there are standard molecular techniques that are used to identify the two major malaria vector groups of mosquitoes. On the assumption that species-diagnostic DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are highly species-specific, experiments were conducted to investigate what would happen if non-vector species were randomly included in the molecular assays.
   Methods: Morphological keys for the Afrotropical Anophelinae were used to provide the a priori identifications. All mosquito specimens were then subjected to the standard PCR assays for members of the Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group.
   Results: One hundred and fifty mosquitoes belonging to 11 morphological species were processed. Three species (Anopheles pretoriensis, Anopheles rufipes and Anopheles rhodesiensis) amplified members of the An. funestus group and four species (An. pretoriensis, An. rufipes, Anopheles listeri and Anopheles squamosus) amplified members of the An. gambiae complex.
   Conclusions: Morphological identification of mosquitoes prior to PCR assays not only saves time and money in the laboratory, but also ensures that data received by malaria vector control programmes are useful for targeting the major vectors.

TI New rapid one-step PCR diagnostic assay for Plasmodium falciparum
   infective mosquitoes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB An essential component of malaria vector control programmes is the detection of Plasmodium falciparum within its mosquito vectors, particularly in the salivary glands where the infective sporozoites reside. Several protocols have been developed for this purpose; however they require dissection of mosquito specimens prior to analysis. Here, a novel one-step RT-qPCR TaqMan diagnostic assay was developed for mosquitoes with infective Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in the salivary glands. It is based on detection of the sporozoite-specific Pfslarp and Pfplp1 gene transcripts. These transcripts were chosen based on bioinformatics analysis, and experimentally verified to be overexpressed in the salivary gland sporozoite stage of the parasite compared to other mosquito parasite stages. The proof of principle and the performance of the assay were demonstrated using RNAlater preserved mosquito samples. Tests of analytical sensitivity showed the novel TaqMan assay to be 100% accurate, although its performance in the field needs to be further demonstrated. This method has no requirement for dissection and post-PCR processing and thus is simple and rapid to perform in individual mosquitoes or mosquito pools. It can be used in single or multiplex formats also targeting additional markers expressed in different tissues, such as detoxification enzymes associated with insecticide resistance.

TI Diagnostic tools in childhood malaria
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Every year, millions of people are burdened with malaria. An estimated 429,000 casualties were reported in 2015, with the majority made up of children under five years old. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is of paramount importance to ensure appropriate administration of treatment. This minimizes the risk of parasite resistance development, reduces drug wastage and unnecessary adverse reaction to antimalarial drugs. Malaria diagnostic tools have expanded beyond the conventional microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films. Contemporary and innovative techniques have emerged, mainly the rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and other molecular diagnostic methods such as PCR, qPCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Even microscopic diagnosis has gone through a paradigm shift with the development of new techniques such as the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method and the Partec rapid malaria test. This review explores the different diagnostic tools available for childhood malaria, each with their characteristic strengths and limitations. These tools play an important role in making an accurate malaria diagnosis to ensure that the use of anti-malaria are rationalized and that presumptive diagnosis would only be a thing of the past.

TI Plasmodium falciparum genetic variation of var2csa in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) bears a high burden of malaria, which is exacerbated in pregnant women. The VAR2CSA protein plays a crucial role in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), and hence quantifying diversity at the var2csa locus in the DRC is important in understanding the basic epidemiology of PAM, and in developing a robust vaccine against PAM.
   Methods: Samples were taken from the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey conducted in the DRC, focusing on children under 5 years of age. A short subregion of the var2csa gene was sequenced in 115 spatial clusters, giving country-wide estimates of sequence polymorphism and spatial population structure.
   Results: Results indicate that var2csa is highly polymorphic, and that diversity is being maintained through balancing selection, however, there is no clear signal of phylogenetic or geographic structure to this diversity. Linear modelling demonstrates that the number of var2csa variants in a cluster correlates directly with cluster prevalence, but not with other epidemiological factors such as urbanicity.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that the DRC fits within the global pattern of high var2csa diversity and little genetic differentiation between regions. A broad multivalent VAR2CSA vaccine candidate could benefit from targeting stable regions and common variants to address the substantial genetic diversity.

TI Efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and
   artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
   falciparum malaria in Maradi, Niger
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria endemic countries need to assess efficacy of anti-malarial treatments on a regular basis. Moreover, resistance to artemisinin that is established across mainland South-East Asia represents today a major threat to global health. Monitoring the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies is of paramount importance to detect as early as possible the emergence of resistance in African countries that toll the highest burden of malaria morbidity and mortality.
   Methods: A WHO standard protocol was used to assess efficacy of the combinations artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ Winthrop (R)), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ, Eurartesim (R)) and artemether-lumefantrine (AM-LM, Coartem (R)) taken under supervision and respecting pharmaceutical recommendations. The study enrolled for each treatment arm 212 children aged 6-59 months living in Maradi (Niger) and suffering with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The Kaplan-Meier 42-day PCR-adjusted cure rate was the primary outcome. A standardized parasite clearance estimator was used to assess delayed parasite clearance as surrogate maker of suspected artemisinin resistance.
   Results: No early treatment failures were found in any of the study treatment arms. The day-42 PCR-adjusted cure rate estimates were 99.5, 98.4 and 99.0% in the AS-AQ, DHA-PPQ and AM-LM arms, respectively. The reinfection rate (expressed also as Kaplan-Meier estimates) was higher in the AM-LM arm (32.4%) than in the AS-AQ (13.8%) and the DHA-PPQ arm (24.9%). The parasite clearance rate constant was 0.27, 0.26 and 0.25 per hour for AS-AQ, DHA-PPQ and AM-LM, respectively.
   Conclusions: All the three treatments evaluated largely meet WHO criteria (at least 95% efficacy). AS-AQ and AL-LM may continue to be used and DHA-PPQ may be also recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Maradi. The parasite clearance rate were consistent with reference values indicating no suspected artemisinin resistance. Nevertheless, the monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy should continue.

TI A novel PCR-based system for the detection of four species of human
   malaria parasites and Plasmodium knowlesi
SO PLOS ONE
AB A microscopy-based diagnosis is the gold standard for the detection and identification of malaria parasites in a patient's blood. However, the detection of cases involving a low number of parasites and the differentiation of species sometimes requires a skilled microscopist. Although PCR-based diagnostic methods are already known to be very powerful tools, the time required to apply such methods is still much longer in comparison to traditional microscopic observation. Thus, improvements to PCR systems are sought to facilitate the more rapid and accurate detection of human malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae, as well as P. knowlesi, which is a simian malaria parasite that is currently widely distributed in Southeast Asia. A nested PCR that targets the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of malaria parasites was performed using a fast PCR enzyme. In the first PCR, universal primers for all parasite species were used. In the second PCR, inner- specific primers, which targeted sequences from P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi, were used. The PCR reaction time was reduced with the use of the-fast PCR enzyme, with only 65 minutes required to perform the first and second PCRs. The specific primers only reacted with the sequences of their targeted parasite species and never cross-reacted with sequences from other species under the defined PCR conditions. The diagnoses of 36 clinical samples that were obtained using this new PCR system were highly consistent with the microscopic diagnoses.

TI Plasmodium vivax molecular diagnostics in community surveys: pitfalls
   and solutions
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB A distinctive feature of Plasmodium vivax infections is the overall low parasite density in peripheral blood. Thus, identifying asymptomatic infected individuals in endemic communities requires diagnostic tests with high sensitivity. The detection limits of molecular diagnostic tests are primarily defined by the volume of blood analysed and by the copy number of the amplified molecular marker serving as the template for amplification. By using mitochondrial DNA as the multi-copy template, the detection limit can be improved more than tenfold, compared to standard 18S rRNA targets, thereby allowing detection of lower parasite densities. In a very low transmission area in Brazil, application of a mitochondrial DNA-based assay increased prevalence from 4.9 to 6.5%. The usefulness of molecular tests in malaria epidemiological studies is widely recognized, especially when precise prevalence rates are desired. Of concern, however, is the challenge of demonstrating test accuracy and quality control for samples with very low parasite densities. In this case, chance effects in template distribution around the detection limit constrain reproducibility. Rigorous assessment of false positive and false negative test results is, therefore, required to prevent over- or under-estimation of parasite prevalence in epidemiological studies or when monitoring interventions.

TI DNA detection of Trypanosoma evansi: Diagnostic validity of a new assay
   based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB Tiypanosoma evansi (T. evansi) is the most widely spread pathogenic trypanosome in the world. The control of trypanosomiasis depends on accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Focusing on the presence of T. evansi in Asia, we developed a detection assay based on tracing phosphate ions (Pi) generated during LAMP targeting the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene of Rode Trypanozoon antigenic type 1.2 (RoTat 1.2 VSG). The diagnostic potential as well as the use of the assay as a test-of-cure method after berenil treatment, was assessed in mice at different time points of infection. In addition, 67 buffalo blood collected from Tongling county, Anhui province, as well as 42 cattle sera from the Shanghai area, were used to evaluate the diagnostic validity of the test. The detection limit of the novel LAMP assay was determined to be as low as 1 fg of T. evansi DNA, while the reaction time for the test was only 30 min. Hence it outperforms both microscopy and PCR. In the test-of-cure assessment, successful berenil mediated cure could be confirmed within 48 h after treatment. This offers a tremendous advantage over conventional antibody-based diagnostic tools in which successful cure only can be confirmed after months. In the cattle and buffalo screening, the LAMP was able to detect a false-negative determined sample, wrongly classified in a conventional microscopy and PCR screening. Finally, no cross-reactivity was observed with other zoonotic parasites, such as T. evansi type B, T. congolense, T. brucei, Schistosoma japonicum, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania donovani, Toxoplasma gondii and Angiostrongylus cantonensis. We conclude that the novel LAMP assay is sensitive, specific and convenient for field use, particularly in areas where infection incidence has become extremely low. The LAMP assay could be used as a tool for trypanosomiasis control and elimination strategies in areas where T. evansi Type A infections are causing a threat to livestock fanning.

TI Asymptomatic Plasmodium malariae infections in children from suburban
   areas of Yaounde, Cameroon
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The gold standard for malaria diagnosis is the microscopic examination of Giemsa stained thick blood smears though microscopy mostly may not detect the presence of Plasmodium species infections in asymptomatic samples. In the reported study, we used two diagnostic methods viz. the conventional microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to analyse the asymptomatic malaria samples. PCR assay amplifying 18S small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of Plasmodium in 122 samples confirmed 68% of isolates as asymptomatic P. falciparum infections; with 87.9% mono-infections. We observed that the P. malariae positive samples were not diagnosed in microscopic examination of the blood smears but the PCR based diagnostic method revealed the presence of 12% P. malariae infections in asymptomatic samples from Yaounde region of Cameroon where no official cases of P. malariae have been reported for over a decade. The sequence analysis further confirmed the presence of 12% P. malariae in malaria positive samples with three base pair deletions and five substitutions in the SSU rRNA gene. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cellular aging dynamics after acute malaria infection: A 12-month
   longitudinal study
SO AGING CELL
AB Accelerated cellular aging and reduced lifespan have recently been shown in birds chronically infected with malaria parasites. Whether malaria infection also affects cellular aging in humans has not been reported. Here, we assessed the effect of a single acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection on cellular aging dynamics in travelers prospectively followed over one year in Sweden. DNA and RNA were extracted from venous blood collected at the time of admission and repeatedly up to one year. Telomere length was measured using real-time quantitative PCR, while telomerase activity and CDKN2A expression were measured by reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR. Our results show that acute malaria infection affects cellular aging as reflected by elevated levels of CDKN2A expression, lower telomerase activity, and substantial telomere shortening during the first three months postinfection. After that CDKN2A expression declined, telomerase activity increased and telomere length was gradually restored over one year, reflecting that cellular aging was reversed. These findings demonstrate that malaria infection affects cellular aging and the underlying cellular mechanism by which pathogens can affect host cellular aging and longevity need to be elucidated. Our results urge the need to investigate whether repeated malaria infections have more pronounced and long-lasting effects on cellular aging and lifespan (similarly to what was observed in birds) in populations living in malaria endemic areas.

TI The links between agriculture, Anopheles mosquitoes, and malaria risk in
   children younger than 5 years in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a
   population-based, cross-sectional, spatial study
SO LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
AB Background The relationship between agriculture, Anopheles mosquitoes, and malaria in Africa is not fully understood, but it is important for malaria control as countries consider expanding agricultural projects to address population growth and food demand. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of agriculture on Anopheles biting behaviour and malaria risk in children in rural areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).
   Methods We did a population-based, cross-sectional, spatial study of rural children (<5 years) in the DR Congo. We used information about the presence of malaria parasites in each child, as determined by PCR analysis of dried-blood spots from the 2013-14 DR Congo Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). We also used data from the DHS, a longitudinal entomological study, and available land cover and climate data to evaluate the relationships between agriculture, Anopheles biting behaviour, and malaria prevalence. Satellite imagery was used to measure the percentage of agricultural land cover around DHS villages and Anopheles sites. Anopheles biting behaviour was assessed by Human Landing Catch. We used probit regression to assess the relationship between agriculture and the probability of malaria infection, as well as the relationship between agriculture and the probability that a mosquito was caught biting indoors.
   Findings Between Aug 13, 2013, and Feb 13, 2014, a total of 9790 dried-blood spots were obtained from the DHS, of which 4612 participants were included in this study. Falciparum malaria infection prevalence in rural children was 38.7% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 37.3-40.0). Increasing exposure to agriculture was associated with increasing malaria risk with a high posterior probability (estimate 0.07, 95% UI -0.04 to 0.17; posterior probability [estimate >0]=0.89), with the probability of malaria infection increased between 0.2% (95% UI -0.1 to 3.4) and 2.6% (-1.5 to 6.6) given a 15% increase in agricultural cover, depending on other risk factors. The models predicted that large increases in agricultural cover (from 0% to 75%) increase the probability of infection by as much as 13.1% (95% UI -7.3 to 28.9). Increased risk might be due to Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, whose probability of biting indoors increased between 11.3% (95% UI -15.3 to 25.6) and 19.7% (-12.1 to 35.9) with a 15% increase in agriculture.
   Interpretation Malaria control programmes must consider the possibility of increased risk due to expanding agriculture. Governments considering initiating large-scale agricultural projects should therefore also consider accompanying additional malaria control measures. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

TI KIR-like activating natural killer cell receptors and their association
   with complicated malaria in north India
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) genomic regions have been suggested to influence malaria pathogenesis and infection susceptibility. KIRs are known as activating natural killer (NK) cell receptors, which upon binding to their corresponding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands cause lysis of any infected cell. We have examined the potential association of KIR genes with complicated malaria (CM) among north Indians in this study and further evaluated the KIR receptor-HLA ligand association on the severity of the disease considering the uncomplicated malaria (UCM) subjects as control. Molecular profiling of KIR and HLA was carried out using the PCR-SSP method. Susceptible association was found for individuals possessing KIR2DS2 (OR = 1.76, p-value = 0.0390), KIR2DL1 (OR = 2.87, p-value = 0.0005) and KIR2DL3 (OR = 2.74, p-value = 0.0011) genes with CM. This was supported by the strong linkage disequilibrium observed for 2DS2-2DL2 (D = 0.87, r(2) = 0.54) with CM. Whereas the receptor-ligand association has revealed risk association against KIR2DS2-HLAC1 (OR = 2.08, p-value = 0.0229), KIR2DL3-HLAC1 (OR = 1.79, p-value = 0.0301), and KIR2DL1-HLAC2 (OR = 2.10, p-value = 0.0175) combinations for complicated malaria. The frequency of different KIR genes are more or less similar to that observed in African population showing not much genetic diversity at KIR level in context to malarial infection. In conclusion, our data indicates KIR gene loci differentially influenced the malarial outcome in north Indians and in particular the KIR2DS2 gene appeared to be associated with disease severity.

TI Impact of treatment and re-treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and
   artesunate-amodiaquine on selection of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug
   resistance gene-1 polymorphisms in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
   Uganda
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   The emergence of resistance against artemisinin combination treatment is a major concern for malaria control. ACTs are recommended as the rescue treatment, however, there is limited evidence as to whether treatment and re-treatment with ACTs select for drug-resistant P. falciparum parasites. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the impact of (re-) treatment using artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) on the selection of P. falciparum multidrug resistance-1 (Pfmdr1) alleles in clinical settings.
   Methods
   P. falciparum positive samples were collected from children aged 12 +/- 59 months in a clinical trial in DR Congo and Uganda. Pfmdr1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis at codons N86Y, Y184F, and D1246Y were performed at baseline and post-treatment with either AL or ASAQ as a rescue treatment using nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays.
   Results
   The pre-treatment prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86 and D1246Y varied significantly between the sites, (p>0.001) and (p = 0.013), respectively. There was borderline significant directional selection for Pfmdr1 184F in recurrent malaria infections after treatment with AL in Uganda site (p = 0.05). Pfmdr1 NFD haplotype did not significantly change in post-treatment infections after re-treatment with either AL or ASAQ. Comparison between pre-treatment and post-treatment recurrences did not indicate directional selection of Pfmdr1 N86, D1246 alleles in the pre-RCT, RCT and post-RCT phases in both AL and ASAQ treatment arms. Pfmdr1 86Y was significantly associated with reduced risk of AL treatment failure (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.11 +/- 1.05, p = 0.04) while no evidence for D1246 allele (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.42 +/- 2.47, p = 1.0). Survival estimates showed that the Pfmdr1 alleles had comparable mean-time to PCR-corrected recrudescence and new infections in both AL and ASAQ treatment arms.
   Conclusion
   We found limited impact of (re-) treatment with AL or ASAQ on selection for Pfmdr1 variants and haplotypes associated with resistance to partner drugs. These findings further supplement the evidence use of same or alternative ACTs as a rescue therapy for recurrent P. falciparum infections. Continued monitoring of genetic signatures of resistance is warranted to timely inform malaria (re-) treatment policies and guidelines.

TI An Alternative Method for Extracting Plasmodium DNA from EDTA Whole
   Blood for Malaria Diagnosis
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Molecular techniques have been introduced for malaria diagnosis because they offer greater sensitivity and specificity than microscopic examinations. Therefore, DNA isolation methods have been developed for easy preparation and cost effectiveness. The present study described a simple protocol for Plasmodium DNA isolation from EDTA-whole blood. This study demonstrated that after heating infected blood samples with Tris-EDTA buffer and proteinase K solution, without isolation and purification steps, the supernatant can be used as a DNA template for amplification by PCR. The sensitivity of the extracted DNA of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was separately analyzed by both PCR and semi-nested PCR (Sn-PCR). The results revealed that for PCR the limit of detection was 40 parasites/mu l for P. falciparum and 35.2 parasites/mu l for P. vivax, whereas for Sn-PCR the limit of detection was 1.6 parasites/mu l for P. falciparum and 1.4 parasites/mu l for P. vivax. This new method was then verified by DNA extraction of whole blood from 11 asymptomatic Myanmar migrant workers and analyzed by Sn-PCR. The results revealed that DNA can be extracted from all samples, and there were 2 positive samples for Plasmodium (P. falciparum and P. vivax). Therefore, the protocol can be an alternative method for DNA extraction in laboratories with limited resources and a lack of trained technicians for malaria diagnosis. In addition, this protocol can be applied for subclinical cases, and this will be helpful for epidemiology and control.

TI Converging Human and Malaria Vector Diagnostics with Data Management
   towards an Integrated Holistic One Health Approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Monitoring malaria prevalence in humans, as well as vector populations, for the presence of Plasmodium, is an integral component of effective malaria control, and eventually, elimination. In the field of human diagnostics, a major challenge is the ability to define, precisely, the causative agent of fever, thereby differentiating among several candidate (also non-malaria) febrile diseases. This requires genetic-based pathogen identification and multiplexed analysis, which, in combination, are hardly provided by the current gold standard diagnostic tools. In the field of vectors, an essential component of control programs is the detection of Plasmodium species within its mosquito vectors, particularly in the salivary glands, where the infective sporozoites reside. In addition, the identification of species composition and insecticide resistance alleles within vector populations is a primary task in routine monitoring activities, aiming to support control efforts. In this context, the use of converging diagnostics is highly desirable for providing comprehensive information, including differential fever diagnosis in humans, and mosquito species composition, infection status, and resistance to insecticides of vectors. Nevertheless, the two fields of human diagnostics and vector control are rarely combined, both at the diagnostic and at the data management end, resulting in fragmented data and mis- or non-communication between various stakeholders. To this direction, molecular technologies, their integration in automated platforms, and the co-assessment of data from multiple diagnostic sources through information and communication technologies are possible pathways towards a unified human vector approach.

TI Submicroscopic placental infection by non-falciparum Plasmodium spp.
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Among the Plasmodium species that infect humans, adverse effects of P. falciparum and P. vivax have been extensively studied and reported with respect to poor outcomes particularly in first time mothers and in pregnant women living in areas with unstable malaria transmission. Although, other non-falciparum malaria infections during pregnancy have sometimes been reported, little is known about the dynamics of these infections during pregnancy.
   Methods and findings
   Using a quantitative PCR approach, blood samples collected from Beninese pregnant women during the first antenatal visit (ANV) and at delivery including placental blood were screened for Plasmodium spp. Risk factors associated with Plasmodium spp. infection during pregnancy were assessed as well as the relationships with pregnancy outcomes.
   P. falciparum was the most prevalent Plasmodium species detected during pregnancy, irrespective either of parity, of age or of season during which the infection occurred. Although no P. vivax infections were detected in this cohort, P. malariae (9.2%) and P. ovale (5.8%) infections were observed in samples collected during the first ANV. These non-falciparum infections were also detected in maternal peripheral blood (1.3% for P. malariae and 1.2% for P. ovale) at delivery. Importantly, higher prevalence of P. malariae (5.5%) was observed in placental than peripheral blood while that of P. ovale was similar (1.8% in placental blood). Among the non-falciparum infected pregnant women with paired peripheral and placental samples, P. malariae infections in the placental blood was significantly higher than in the peripheral blood, suggesting a possible affinity of P. malariae for the placenta. However, no assoctiation of non-falciparum infections and the pregnancy outcomes was observed
   Conclusions
   Overall this study provided insights into the molecular epidemiology of Plasmodium spp. infection during pregnancy, indicating placental infection by non-falciparum Plasmodium and the lack of association of these infections with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI Spatial and temporal distribution of Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 alleles and
   genetic profile change of Plasmodium falciparum populations in Gabon
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Plasmodium population dynamics analysis may help to assess the impact of malaria control strategies deployment. In Gabon, new strategies have been introduced, but malaria is still a public health problem marked by a rebound of the prevalence in 2011. The aim of the study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of P. falciparum strains in different areas in Gabon during a period of malaria transmission transition, between 2008 and 2011. A total of 109 P. falciparum isolates were genotyped using nested-PCR of Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 genes. 3D7, FC27 and K1 allele frequencies were comparable between sites (p = 0.9); those of Ro33 (93.6%; 44/47) and Mad20 (60%; 12/20) were significantly higher in isolates from Oyem (p < 0.01) and Port-Gentil (p = 0.02), respectively. The frequency of multiples infections (77%) and the complexity of infection (2.66 +/- 1.44) were the highest at Oyem. Pfmsp1 gene analysis highlighted a trend of a decreasing frequency of K1 family, in Libreville and Oyem between 2008 and 2011; while that of Ro33 (p < 0.01) and Mad20 (p < 0.01) increased. The prevalence of multiple infections was comparable between both periods in each site: 42.2% vs 47.6% (p = 0.6) in Libreville and 57.7% vs 61.7% in Oyem (p = 0.8). In contrast, in 2011, the COI tends to be higher in Libreville and did not vary in Oyem. These data confirm an extended genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates over time and according to geographic location in Gabon. Nevertheless, the impact of the deployment of malaria control strategies on the parasites genetic profile is not clearly established here.

TI Plant hormone cytokinins control cell cycle progression and plastid
   replication in apicomplexan parasites
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Cytokinins are plant hormones that are involved in regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell and plastid development. Here, we show that the apicomplexan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei, an opportunistic human pathogen and a rodent malaria agent, respectively, produce cytokinins via a biosynthetic pathway similar to that in plants. Cytokinins regulate the growth and cell cycle progression of T. gondii by mediating expression of the cyclin gene TgCYC4. A natural form of cytokinin, trans-zeatin (t-zeatin), upregulated expression of this cyclin, while a synthetic cytokinin, thidiazuron, downregulated its expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR analysis showed that t-zeatin increased the genome-copy number of apicoplast, which are non-photosynthetic plastid, in the parasite, while thidiazuron led to their disappearance. Thidiazuron inhibited growth of T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, a human malaria parasite, suggesting that thidiazuron has therapeutic potential as an inhibitor of apicomplexan parasites.

TI High prevalence of malaria in a non-endemic setting: comparison of
   diagnostic tools and patient outcome during a four-year survey
   (2013-2017)
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is no longer endemic in Italy since 1970 when the World Health Organization declared Italy malaria-free, but it is now the most commonly imported disease. The aim of the study was to analyse the trend of imported malaria cases in Parma, Italy, during January 2013-June 2017, reporting also the treatment and the outcome of cases, exploring the comparison of the three diagnostic tests used for malaria diagnosis: microscopy, immunochromatographic assay (ICT) -(BinaxNOW (R)) and Real-time PCR assays detecting Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale curtisi, Plasmodium ovale wallikeri, and Plasmodium knowlesi.
   Results: Of the 288 patients with suspected malaria, 87 were positive by microscopy: 73 P. falciparum, 2 P. vivax, 8 P. ovale, 1 P. vivax/P. ovale, 1 P. malariae and 2 Plasmodium sp. All samples were positive by ICT except 6. Plasmodial DNA was revealed in the 87 cases and in 2 additional cases showing P. falciparum-specific bands by ICT, as follows: 75 P. falciparum, 2 P. vivax, 6 P. ovale curtisi, 3 P. ovale wallikeri, 1 P. malariae, and 2 mixed infections. 72 patients were foreigners and 17 Italians travelling for tourism or business. The majority of these patients presented with fever at blood collection and did not have chemoprophylaxis. No fatal cases were observed and the drug mostly used was quinine observing a negative blood smear or a parasitaemia < 0.001% after 48-72 h' therapy.
   Conclusions: The study shows an update and a thorough analysis of imported malaria cases in the area of Parma during 4.5 years from the point of view of the total case management, clinical and diagnostic. The prevalence of malaria in such area in the considered period was especially due to immigrants mostly from Africa. Molecular methods were more sensitive and specific than microscopy and ICT, both detecting additional cases of P. falciparum malaria missed by microscopy and correctly identifying the Plasmodium species of medical interest. The data reported in this study may stimulate the clinicians in non-endemic areas to suspect malaria also in cases, where the most typical symptoms are absent, and the parasitologists to confirm the results of microscopy, remaining the reference method, with molecular methods to avoid misdiagnosis.

TI Entomological impact of indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl:
   a pilot study in an area of low malaria transmission in Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Scaling-up of effective anti-malarial control strategies in Central-West region of Senegal has resulted in the sharp decline in malaria prevalence in this area. However, despite these strategies, residual malaria transmission has been observed in some villages (hot spots). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) with pirimiphos-methyl on malaria transmission in hot spot areas.
   Methods: The malaria vector population dynamics were monitored in each of the six selected villages (4 of which used IRS, 2 were unsprayed control areas) using overnight human landing catches (HLC) and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). The host source of blood meals from freshly fed females collected using PSC was identified using the direct ELISA method. Females caught through HLC were tested by ELISA for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein and Anopheles gambiae complex was identified using PCR.
   Results: Preliminary data shown that the densities of Anopheles populations were significantly lower in the sprayed areas (179/702) compared to the control. Overall, malaria transmission risk was 14 times lower in the intervention zone (0.94) compared to the control zone (12.7). In the control areas, three Anopheles species belonging to the Gambiae complex (Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles melas) maintained the transmission, while only An. coluzzii was infective in the sprayed areas.
   Conclusion: The preliminary data from this pilot study showed that IRS with the CS formulation of pirimiphos-methyl is likely very effective in reducing malaria transmission risk. However, additional studies including further longitudinal entomological surveys as well as ecological and ethological and genetical characterization of vectors species and their populations are needed to better characterize the entomological impact of indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl in the residual transmission areas of Senegal.

TI True malaria prevalence in children under five: Bayesian estimation
   using data of malaria household surveys from three sub-Saharan countries
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is one of the major causes of childhood death in sub-Saharan countries. A reliable estimation of malaria prevalence is important to guide and monitor progress toward control and elimination. The aim of the study was to estimate the true prevalence of malaria in children under five in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Kenya, using a Bayesian modelling framework that combined in a novel way malaria data from national household surveys with external information about the sensitivity and specificity of the malaria diagnostic methods used in those surveys-i.e., rapid diagnostic tests and light microscopy.
   Methods: Data were used from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DHS 2013-2014), Uganda (MIS 2014-2015) and Kenya (MIS 2015), where information on infection status using rapid diagnostic tests and/or light microscopy was available for 13,573 children. True prevalence was estimated using a Bayesian model that accounted for the conditional dependence between the two diagnostic methods, and the uncertainty of their sensitivities and specificities obtained from expert opinion.
   Results: The estimated true malaria prevalence was 20% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 17%-23%) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 22% (95% UI 9-32%) in Uganda and 1% (95% UI 0-3%) in Kenya. According to the model estimations, rapid diagnostic tests had a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and light microscopy had a variable sensitivity, but a satisfactory specificity. Adding reported history of fever in the previous 14 days as a third diagnostic method to the model did not affect model estimates, highlighting the poor performance of this indicator as a malaria diagnostic.
   Conclusions: In the absence of a gold standard test, Bayesian models can assist in the optimal estimation of the malaria burden, using individual results from several tests and expert opinion about the performance of those tests.

TI Population genetic structure and natural selection of Plasmodium
   falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 in Myanmar isolates
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) is one of leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. However, genetic variation and antigenic diversity identified in global PfAMA-1 are major hurdles in the development of an effective vaccine based on this antigen. In this study, genetic structure and the effect of natural selection of PfAMA-1 among Myanmar P. falciparum isolates were analysed.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 58 Myanmar patients with falciparum malaria. Full-length PfAMA-1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a TA cloning vector. PfAMA-1 sequence of each isolate was sequenced. Polymorphic characteristics and effect of natural selection were analysed with using DNASTAR, MEGA4, and DnaSP programs. Polymorphic nature and natural selection in 459 global PfAMA-1 were also analysed.
   Results: Thirty-seven different haplotypes of PfAMA-1 were identified in 58 Myanmar P. falciparum isolates. Most amino acid changes identified in Myanmar PfAMA-1 were found in domains I and III. Overall patterns of amino acid changes in Myanmar PfAMA-1 were similar to those in global PfAMA-1. However, frequencies of amino acid changes differed by country. Novel amino acid changes in Myanmar PfAMA-1 were also identified. Evidences for natural selection and recombination event were observed in global PfAMA-1. Among 51 commonly identified amino acid changes in global PfAMA-1 sequences, 43 were found in predicted RBC-binding sites, B-cell epitopes, or IUR regions.
   Conclusions: Myanmar PfAMA-1 showed similar patterns of nucleotide diversity and amino acid polymorphisms compared to those of global PfAMA-1. Balancing natural selection and intragenic recombination across PfAMA-1 are likely to play major roles in generating genetic diversity in global PfAMA-1. Most common amino acid changes in global PfAMA-1 were located in predicted B-cell epitopes where high levels of nucleotide diversity and balancing natural selection were found. These results highlight the strong selective pressure of host immunity on the PfAMA-1 gene. These results have significant implications in understanding the nature of Myanmar PfAMA-1 along with global PfAMA-1. They also provide useful information for the development of effective malaria vaccine based on this antigen.

TI An Observational Study of the Effect of Hemoglobinopathy, Alpha
   Thalassemia and Hemoglobin E on P. Vivax Parasitemia
SO MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: The protective effect of alpha-thalassemia, a common hematological disorder in Southeast Asia, against Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been well established. However, there is much less understanding of the effect of alpha-thalassemia against P. vivax. Here, we aimed to investigate the proportion of alpha-thalassemia including the impact of alpha-thalassemia and HbE on the parasitemia of P. vivax in Southeast Asian malaria patients in Thailand.
   Methods: A total of 210 malaria patients, admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand during 2011-2012, consisting of 159 Myanmeses, 13 Karens, 26 Thais, 3 Mons, 3 Laotians, and 6 Cambodians were recruited. Plasmodium spp. and parasite densities were determined. Group of deletion mutation (--(SEA), -alpha(3.7), -alpha(4.2) deletion) and substitution mutation (HbCS and HbE) were genotyped using multiplex gap-PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively.
   Results: In our malaria patients, 17/210 homozygous and 74/210 heterozygous -alpha(3.7) deletion were found. Only 3/210 heterozygous -a4.2 and 2/210 heterozygous--(SEA) deletion were detected. HbE is frequently found with 6/210 homozygotes and 35/210 heterozygotes. The most common thalassemia allele frequencies in Myanmar population were -alpha(3.7) deletion (0.282), followed by HbE (0.101), HbCS (0.013), -alpha(4.2) deletion (0.009), and --(SEA) deletion (0.003). Only density of P. vivax in alpha-thalassemia trait patients (-alpha(3.7)/-alpha(3.7), --(SEA)/alpha alpha, -alpha(3.7)/-alpha(4.2)) but not in silent alpha-thalassemia (-alpha(3.7)/alpha alpha, -alpha(4.2)/alpha alpha, alpha alpha(CS)/alpha alpha) were significantly higher compared with non-alpha-thalassemia patients (p=0.027). HbE did not affect P. vivax parasitemia. The density of P. falciparum significantly increased in heterozygous HbE patients (p=0.046).
   Conclusions: Alpha-thalassemia trait is associated with high levels of P. vivax parasitemia in malaria patients in Southeast Asia.

TI Temporal changes in genetic diversity of msp-1, msp-2, and msp-3 in
   Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Grande Comore Island after
   introduction of ACT
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is still one of the serious public health problems in Grande Comore Island, although the number of annual cases has been greatly reduced in recent years. A better understanding of malaria parasite population diversity and transmission dynamics is critical for assessing the effectiveness of malaria control measures. The objective of this study is to investigate temporal changes in genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations and multiplicity of infection (MOI) in Grande Comore 10 years after introduction of ACT.
   Methods: A total of 232 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected from the Grande Comore Island during two sampling periods (118 for 2006. 2007 group, and 114 for 2013. 2016 group). Parasite isolates were characterized for genetic diversity and complexity of infection by genotyping polymorphic regions in merozoite surface protein gene 1 (msp-1), msp-2, and msp-3 using nested PCR and DNA sequencing.
   Results: Three msp-1 alleles (K1, MAD20, and RO33), two msp-2 alleles (FC27 and 3D7), and two msp-3 alleles (K1 and 3D7) were detected in parasites of both sampling periods. The RO33 allele of msp-1 (84.8%), 3D7 allele of msp-2 (90.8%), and K1 allele of msp-3 (66.7%) were the predominant allelic types in isolates from 2006-2007 group. In contrast, the RO33 allele of msp-1 (63.4%), FC27 allele of msp-2 (91.1%), and 3D7 allele of msp-3 (53.5%) were the most prevalent among isolates from the 2013-2016 group. Compared with the 2006. 2007 group, polyclonal infection rates of msp-1 (from 76.7 to 29.1%, P < 0.01) and msp-2 (from 62.4 to 28.3%, P < 0.01) allelic types were significantly decreased in those from 2013. 2016 group. Similarly, the MOIs for both msp-1 and msp-2 were higher in P. falciparum isolates in the 2006-2007 group than those in 2013-2016 group (MOI = 3.11 vs 1.63 for msp-1; MOI = 2.75 vs 1.35 for msp-2). DNA sequencing analyses also revealed reduced numbers of distinct sequence variants in the three genes from 2006. 2007 to 2013. 2016: msp-1, from 32 to 23 (about 28% decline); msp-2 from 29 to 21 (about 28% decline), and msp-3 from 11 to 3 (about 72% decline).
   Conclusions: The present data showed dramatic reduction in genetic diversity and MOI among Grande Comore P. falciparum populations over the course of the study, suggesting a trend of decreasing malaria transmission intensity and genetic diversity in Grande Comore Island. These data provide valuable information for surveillance of P. falciparum infection and for assessing the appropriateness of the current malarial control strategies in the endemic area.

TI Prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine
   resistance among patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria in three provinces in Angola, 2015
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first-line anti-malarial treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in Angola. To date, the prevalence of polymorphisms in the pfk13 gene, associated with artemisinin resistance, and pfmdr1, associated with lumefantrine resistance, have not been systematically studied in Angola.
   Methods: DNA was isolated from pretreatment and late treatment failure dried blood spots collected during the 2015 round of therapeutic efficacy studies in Benguela, Lunda Sul, and Zaire Provinces in Angola. The pfk13 propeller domain and pfmdr1 gene were sequenced and analysed for polymorphisms. Pfmdr1 copy number variation was assessed using a real-time PCR method. The association between pfmdr1 and pfk13 mutations and treatment failure was investigated.
   Results: The majority of pretreatment (99%, 466/469) and all late treatment failure (100%, 50/50) samples were wild type for pfk13. Three of the pretreatment samples (1%) carried the A578S mutation commonly observed in Africa and not associated with artemisinin resistance. All 543 pretreatment and day of late treatment failure samples successfully analysed for pfmdr1 copy number variation carried one copy of pfmdr1. The NYD haplotype was the predominant pfmdr1 haplotype, present in 63% (308/491) of pretreatment samples, followed by NFD, which was present in 32% (157/491) of pretreatment samples. The pfmdr1 N86 allele was overrepresented in day of late treatment failure samples from participants receiving artemether-lumefantrine (p value 0.03).
   Conclusions: The pretreatment parasites in patients participating in therapeutic efficacy studies in 2015 in Angola's three sentinel sites showed genetic evidence of susceptibility to artemisinins, consistent with clinical outcome data showing greater than 99% day 3 clearance rates. The lack of increased pfmdr1 copy number is consistent with previous reports from sub-Saharan Africa. Although pfmdr1 NYD and NFD haplotypes were overrepresented in artemether-lumefantrine late treatment failure samples, their role as markers of resistance was unclear given that these haplotypes were also present in the majority of successfully treated patients in the artemether- lumefantrine treatment arms.

TI Plasmodium falciparum diagnostic tools in HIV-positive under-5-year-olds
   in two ART clinics in Ghana: are there missed infections?
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum, the most dominant species in sub-Saharan Africa, causes the most severe clinical malaria manifestations. In resource-limited Ghana, where malaria and HIV geographically overlap, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is a faster, easier and cheaper alternative to clinical gold standard light microscopy. However, mutations in parasite hrp2 gene may result in missed infections, which have severe implications for malaria control.
   Methods: The performance of a common HRP2-based RDT and expert light microscopy in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children under 5 years old was compared with PCR as laboratory gold standard. Finger-prick capillary blood was tested with First Response (R) Malaria Ag P. falciparum (HRP2). Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films were examined with >= 200 high power fields and parasites counted per 200 white blood cells. Nested PCR species identification of P. falciparum was performed and resolved on agarose gel. False negatives from RDT were further tested for deleted pfhrp2/3 and flanking genes, using PCR. The study was performed in two anti-retroviral therapy clinics in Accra and Atibie.
   Results: Out of 401 participants enrolled, 150 were HIV positive and 251 HIV negative. Malaria was more prevalent in children without HIV. Microscopy had a higher sensitivity [100% (99-100)] than RDT [83% (53.5-100)]. Parasites with pfhrp2/3 deletions contributed to missed infections from RDT false negatives.
   Conclusion: Circulation of malaria parasites with pfrhp2/3 deletions in this population played a role in missed infections with RDT. This ought to be addressed if further strides in malaria control are to be made.

TI SeekDeep: single-base resolution de novo clustering for amplicon deep
   sequencing
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB PCR amplicon deep sequencing continues to transform the investigation of genetic diversity in viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic populations. In eukaryotic populations such as Plasmodium falciparum infections, it is important to discriminate sequences differing by a single nucleotide polymorphism. In bacterial populations, single-base resolution can provide improved resolution towards species and strains. Here, we introduce the SeekDeep suite built around the qluster algorithm, which is capable of accurately building de novo clusters representing true, biological local haplotypes differing by just a single base. It outperforms current software, particularly at low frequencies and at low input read depths, whether resolving single-base differences or traditional OTUs. SeekDeep is open source and works with all major sequencing technologies, making it broadly useful in a wide variety of applications of amplicon deep sequencing to extract accurate and maximal biologic information.

TI Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): a versatile technique for
   detection of micro-organisms
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) amplifies DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions by using a DNA polymerase with high displacement strand activity and a set of specifically designed primers to amplify targeted DNA strands. Following its first discovery by Notomi etal. (Nucleic Acids Res 28: E63), LAMP was further developed over the years which involved the combination of this technique with other molecular approaches, such as reverse transcription and multiplex amplification for the detection of infectious diseases caused by micro-organisms in humans, livestock and plants. In this review, available types of LAMP techniques will be discussed together with their applications in detection of various micro-organisms. Up to date, there are varieties of LAMP detection methods available including colorimetric and fluorescent detection, real-time monitoring using turbidity metre and detection using lateral flow device which will also be highlighted in this review. Apart from that, commercialization of LAMP technique had also been reported such as lyophilized form of LAMP reagents kit and LAMP primer sets for detection of pathogenic micro-organisms. On top of that, advantages and limitations of this molecular detection method are also described together with its future potential as a diagnostic method for infectious disease.

TI A Randomized Trial Evaluating the Prophylactic Activity of DSM265
   Against Preerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum Infection During
   Controlled Human Malarial Infection by Mosquito Bites and Direct Venous
   Inoculation
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. DSM265 is a selective inhibitor of Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase that fully protected against controlled human malarial infection (CHMI) by direct venous inoculation of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites when administered 1 day before challenge and provided partial protection when administered 7 days before challenge.
   Methods. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 1 oral dose of 400 mg of DSM265 before CHMI. Three cohorts were studied, with DSM265 administered 3 or 7 days before direct venous inoculation of sporozoites or 7 days before 5 bites from infected mosquitoes.
   Results. DSM265-related adverse events consisted of mild-to-moderate headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. DSM265 concentrations were consistent with pharmacokinetic models (mean area under the curve extrapolated to infinity, 1707 mu g*h/mL). Placebo-treated participants became positive by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and were treated 7-10 days after CHMI. Among DSM265-treated subjects, 2 of 6 in each cohort were sterilely protected. DSM265-treated recipients had longer times to development of parasitemia than placebo-treated participants (P<.004).
   Conclusions. This was the first CHMI study of a novel antimalarial compound to compare direct venous inoculation of sporozoites and mosquito bites. Times to qRT-PCR positivity and treatment were comparable for both routes. DSM265 given 3 or 7 days before CHMI was safe and well tolerated but sterilely protected only one third of participants.

TI Prevalence of the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutations among asymptomatic
   pregnant women in Southeast Nigeria
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended drug for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Resistance to SP is related to mutations in the dhfr and dhps gene of Plasmodium falciparum. This study determined the prevalence of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps polymorphisms found in asymptomatic pregnant women attending antenatal care in Calabar, Nigeria. From October 2013 to November 2014, asymptomatic pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Malaria diagnosis testing was done using thick and thin smears. Dried blood spot filter papers were collected. Parasite DNA was extracted from the filter papers using a chelex extraction. Extraction was followed by nested PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. P. falciparum infection was detected by microscopy in 7% (32/459) participants. Twenty-eight P. falciparum isolates were successfully genotyped. In the Pfdhfr gene, the triple mutation was almost fixed; S108N mutation was (100%), N51I (93%) and C59R mutations (93%), whereas the I164L mutation was absent. The prevalence of Pfdhps S436A, A437G, A581G and A613S mutations was 82.1% (23/28), 96.4% (27/28), 71.4% (20/28) and 71.4% (20/28) respectively. The K540E mutation was absent. The prevalence of the Pfdhfr triple mutation IRNI was 92.9% (26/28). The efficacy of SP as IPTp in Southeast Nigeria may be severely threatened. The continuous monitoring of SP molecular markers of resistance is required to assess thresholds. The evaluation of alternative preventive treatment strategies and drug options for preventing malaria in pregnancy may be necessary.

TI Apoptosis of Acanthamoeba castellanii Trophozoites Induced by Oleic Acid
SO JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB Acanthamoeba spp. can be parasitic in certainsituations and are responsible for serious human infections, including Acanthamoeba keratitis, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, and cutaneous acanthamoebiasis. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites and tested the inhibitory activity of the main fatty acids, oleic acid and arachidonic acid, invitro. Oleic acid markedly inhibited the growth of A.castellanii, with trophozoite viability of 57.4% at a concentration of 200M. Caspase-3 staining and annexin V assays showed that apoptotic death occurred in A.castellanii trophozoites. Quantitative PCR and dot blot analysis showed increased levels of metacaspase and interleukin-1 converting enzyme, which is also an indication of apoptosis. In contrast, arachidonic acid showed negligible inhibition of growth of A.castellanii trophozoites. Stimulated expression of Atg3, Atg8 and LC3A/B genes and monodansylcadaverine labeling suggested that oleic acid induces apoptosis by triggering autophagy of trophozoites.

TI Detection of mutated Plasmodium vivax Kelch Propeller Domain (PvK12) in
   Malaysian isolates
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Malaysia is located near the borders of countries where artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum (mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain [PfK13]) have been reported. Plasmodium vivax Kelch propeller domain, PvK12, the ortholog of PfK13, could assess resistance towards artemisinin in vivax malaria. Polymorphisms in PvK12 gene were determined by PCR and sequencing was done in 300 clinical isolates collected in recent years (2012-2017) from hospitals within the country. Among 48 P. vivax samples, all were Sal-1 wild type alleles except for two isolates, a synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation respectively. The nonsynonymous (V552I) isolate was collected from an immigrant. P. vivax with mutated PvK12 is speculated to be an imported case and is likely to be circulating at very low frequency in Malaysia. An in-depth drug resistance surveillance among immigrants needs to be investigated to provide information that may be crucial for drug policy changes.

TI Prospective Clinical Trial Assessing Species-Specific Efficacy of
   Artemether-Lumefantrine for the Treatment of Plasmodium malariae,
   Plasmodium ovale, and Mixed Plasmodium Malaria in Gabon
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Treatment recommendations for Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale malaria are largely based on anecdotal evidence. The aim of this prospective study, conducted in Gabon, was to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated P. malariae or P. ovale species monoinfections or mixed Plasmodium infections. Patients with microscopically confirmed P. malariae, P. ovale, or mixed-species malaria with at least one of these two Plasmodium species were treated with an oral, fixed-dose combination of artemether-lumefantrine for 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoints were per-protocol PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on days 28 and 42. Tolerability and safety were recorded throughout the follow-up period. Seventy-two participants (42 male and 30 female) were enrolled; 62.5% of them had PCR-corrected mixed Plasmodium infections. Per protocol, PCR-corrected ACPR rates were 96.6% (95% confidence interval [ CI], 91.9 to 100) on day 28 and 94.2% (95% CI, 87.7 to 100) on day 42. Considering Plasmodium species independently from their coinfecting species, day 42 ACPR rates were 95.5% (95% CI, 89.0 to 100) for P. falciparum, 100% (exact CI, 84.6 to 100) for P. malariae, 100% (exact CI, 76.8 to 100) for P. ovale curtisi, and 90.9% (95% CI, 70.7 to 100) for P. ovale wallikeri. Study drug-related adverse events were generally mild or moderate. In conclusion, this clinical trial demonstrated satisfying antimalarial activity of artemether-lumefantrine against P. ovale wallikeri, P. ovale curtisi, P. malariae, and mixed Plasmodium infections, with per-protocol efficacies of 90% to 100% and without evident tolerability or safety concerns.

TI Gold(I) phosphine compounds as parasite attenuating agents for malaria
   vaccine and drug development
SO METALLOMICS
AB Here, the anti-malarial activity of two gold(i) phosphine compounds auranofin and [Au(d2pype)(2)]Cl (where d2pype is 1,2-bis(di-2-pyridylphosphino)ethane), were examined to inform their use as potential drugs and malaria parasite-attenuating agents. In vitro, the gold compounds were active against Plasmodium falciparum and P. knowlesi as well as the rodent parasite P. chabaudi AS. Attenuation of the parasite was observed when mice were inoculated with P. chabaudi AS infected red blood cells treated in vitro with [Au(d2pype)(2)]Cl (1 or 2 M) or auranofin (2 M) for 2 or 3 h. Quantitative PCR data showed persistence of low levels of parasite DNA up to 8 days post inoculation. In some experiments, there was microscopically detectable parastiemia following inoculation which subsequently cleared. Following 1 or 3 doses of gold compound-treated parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs), protection was not observed when these mice were subsequently challenged with wild type P. chabaudi AS. In experiments where microscopically detectable parasites were observed following in vivo inoculation, mice were subsequently fully protected against a challenge infection with wildtype parasites. In an infect-and-treat rodent model, the gold compounds were unable to inhibit P. chabaudi AS growth in vivo when administered orally. Gold compounds act via the inhibition of antioxidant systems which are critical in the pathogen's survival from attack by the host oxidants. In vitro, they directly inhibit the parasite thioredoxin reductase, hence the observed suppressive activity. On the other hand, in vivo, the gold compounds may not be readily available for absorption and thus pharmacokinetic studies will be required to further examine drug bioavailability following administration. With structural differences in redox mechanisms of P. falciparum and the human host being identified, gold compounds can be better designed to more efficiently target and selectively inhibit the parasite.

TI Human babesiosis in Southeast China: A case report
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB A 60-year-old female patient living in Southeast China presented with persistent fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, and dizziness of 12-day duration. Blood tests showed neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and active hemolytic anemia, with elevated C-reactive protein. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered for a possible diagnosis of sepsis, without any response. Malaria was initially diagnosed after visualizing intraerythrocytic ring-shaped parasites in bone marrow and blood smears. The patient resided in an area of unstable endemicity for Plasmodium falciparum. Blood samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a definitive diagnosis of human babesiosis was made using Babesia microti-specific PCR. Chloroquine phosphate and clindamycin were started and the patient became normothermic. However, due to the intolerable adverse effects of the antibiotics, intravenous azithromycin was given as an alternative. The patient recovered from fever and hemolysis, and repeated peripheral blood smears showed hemoparasite clearance. Cases of human babesiosis are rarely reported and probably under-diagnosed in China; therefore, improving our understanding of this disease as a newly emerging public health threat is imperative.

TI Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in human
   immunodeficiency virus-infected adults living in Gabon (Central
   Africa)-a pilot study
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: Submicroscopic malaria infections contribute to malaria transmission. Describing the extent of the parasite reservoir is of importance. In people Living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the frequency of subpatent malaria infections is rarely reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of submicroscopic infections in people Living with HIV in Gabon and its relationship with cotrimoxazole (CTX) use.
   Methods: A survey was conducted in two health care centres in rural areas (Koulamoutou and Oyem) and three in urban areas (Libreville) of Gabon from March 2015 to June 2016. Blood samples were collected from consenting people Living with HIV with a negative blood smear. Information on CTX and antiretroviral therapy intake was recorded from the medical file of the patient and through an interview. For molecular analysis, the Plasmodium small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Submicroscopic infections were detected in 10.1% (n=12/119) of the people Living with HIV more frequently in those residing in rural areas (15.1%) compared with urban areas (2.1%) (p<0.01). The proportion of anaemic patients was 1.74-fold more frequent in malaria-infected patients, although not statistically significant. Submicroscopic infections frequency did not vary according to CTX intake (p=0.6).
   Conclusions: The present pilot study highlights a non-negligible frequency of submicroscopic malaria infections in people Living with HIV from rural areas, but no relationship with CTX intake was found.

TI PLASMODIUM INFECTIONS IN ANOPHELES MOSQUITOES IN UBON RATCHATHANI
   PROVINCE, NORTHEASTERN THAILAND DURING A MALARIA OUTBREAK
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
AB An unprecedented malaria outbreak occurred in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeastern Thailand, in 2014. The province showed the highest number of malaria cases of all Thai provinces. Five entomological surveys were conducted at 8 sentinel sites from September 2013 to September 2015 to address the role of different Anopheles species in malaria transmission. Mosquito collections were conducted using human landing catches and cow bait. A total of 10,369 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected and 2,240 were morphologically identified as potential malaria vectors, including An. dirus (n = 78), An. minimus (n = 18), An. sawadwongporni (n = 4), An. barbirostris s.l. (n = 819), An. philippinensis (n = 612), An. nivipes (n = 676), An. annularis (n = 42), An. aconitus (n = 7), and An. rampae (n = 142). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to screen for the presence of Plasmodium spp. in salivary glands. The proportion of primary vectors of surveyed villages was very low (<1%), and no Plasmodium-infected specimens were detected among in the 2,240 Anopheles mosquitoes tested. The absence of positive Plasmodium samples during malaria outbreaks suggests that malaria transmission most likely occurred outside the villages, particularly in the deep-forested hilly areas that provided suitable habitats for competent malaria vectors. These results emphasize the need to develop vector control related to village community activities to reduce malaria transmission along Thailand border areas.

TI Immunomodulatory effect of hemozoin on pneumocyte apoptosis via CARD9
   pathway, a possibly retarding pulmonary resolution
SO EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent malaria parasite species, causes severe symptoms especially acute lung injury (ALI), of which characterized by alveolar epithelium and endothelium destruction and accelerated to blood-gas-barrier breakdown. Parasitized erythrocytes, endothelial cells, monocytes, and cytokines are all involved in this mechanism, but hemozoin (HZ), the parasitic waste from heme detoxification, also mainly contributes. In addition, it is not clear why type II pneumocyte proliferation, alveolar restorative stage, is rare in malaria-associated ALI. To address this, in vitro culture of A549 cells with Plasmodium HZ or with interleukin (IL)-1 triggered by HZ and monocytes (HZ-IL-1) was conducted to determine their alveolar apoptotic effect using ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining, annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, and electron mircroscopic study. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9), the apoptotic regulator gene, and IL-1 were quantified by reverse-transcriptase PCR. Junctional cellular defects were characterized by immunohistochemical staining of E-cadherin. The results revealed that cellular apoptosis and CARD9 expression levels were extremely high 24 h after induction by HZ-IL-1 when compared to the HZ- and non-treated groups. E-cadherin was markedly down-regulated by HZ-IL-1 and HZ treatments. CARD9 expression was positively correlated with IL-1 expression and the number of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, the localization of HZ in the vesicular surfactant of apoptotic pneumocyte was also identified and submitted to be a cause of alveolar resolution abnormality. Thus, HZ triggers monocytes to produce IL-1 and induces pneumocyte type II apoptosis through CARD9 pathway in association with down-regulated E-cadherin, which probably impairs alveolar resolution in malaria-associated ALI.

   Plasmodium knowlesi is recognised as the main cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia. The disease is often misdiagnosed as P. falciparum or P. malariae infections by microscopy, and the disease is difficult to eliminate due to its presence in both humans and monkeys. P. knowlesi infections can rapidly cause severe disease and require prompt diagnosis and treatment. No protein biomarker exists for the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of P. knowlesi infections. Plasmodium knowlesi infections can be diagnosed by PCR.
   Methods and principal findings
   Phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) is involved in malaria lipid biosynthesis and is not found in the human host. The P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi PMT proteins were recombinantly expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli host cells, affinity purified and used to raise antibodies in chickens. Antibodies against each recombinant PMT protein all detected all three recombinant proteins and the native 29 kDa P. falciparum PMT protein on western blots and in ELISA. Antibodies against a PMT epitope (PLENNQYT-DEGVKC) common to all three PMT orthologues detected all three proteins. Antibodies against unique peptides from each orthologue of PMT, PfCEVEHKYLHENKE, PvVYSI-KEYNSLKDC, PkLYPTDEYNSLKDC detected only the parent protein in western blots and P. falciparum infected red blood cell lysates or blood lysates spiked with the respective proteins. Similar concentrations of PfPMT and the control, PfLDH, were detected in the same parasite lysate. The recombinant PfPMT protein was detected by a human anti-malaria antibody pool.
   Conclusion
   PMT, like the pan-specific LDH biomarker used in RDT tests, is both soluble, present at comparable concentrations in the parasite and constitutes a promising antimalarial drug target. PMT is absent from the human proteome. PMT has the potential as a biomarker for human malaria and in particular as the first P. knowlesi specific protein with diagnostic potential for the identification of a P. knowlesi infection.

TI Elevated Plasmodium infection rates and high pyrethroid resistance in
   major malaria vectors in a forested area of Cameroon highlight
   challenges of malaria control
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: High coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is the cornerstone of the malaria control strategy of the national malaria control program (NMCP) in Cameroon, with a target of reducing malaria transmission to less than 10% by 2035. To this end, more than 20 million LLINs have been distributed to populations countrywide since 2011. The present study evaluated entomological indices and Anopheles susceptibility to pyrethroids in a rural forested area of south Cameroon with high coverage of LLINs.
   Methods: The study was conducted between July 2014 and May 2016 in Obout, a village located in a rural forested area in south Cameroon. Resting mosquitoes were collected using electric aspirators and were identified to species using morphological criteria and PCR tools. Mosquito feeding preferences and infection status to Plasmodium falciparum were determined by ELISA and using TaqMan assays. The susceptibility of wild F1 adults to pyrethroids was monitored using WHO insecticide susceptibility bioassays.
   Results: During the study period, 5,993 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected indoors both in rooms with and without nets. Two main vector species, namely An. funestus and An. gambiae, were identified in the locality, with An. funestus being by far the most abundant (89.68%). ELISA analysis revealed high percentage of blood meal taken exclusively on human (97.65-98.95%) supporting the high antropohilic behaviour of both species. Plasmodium falciparum infection rate detected by ELISA was high throughout the study period and varied between 3.28-14.04% (mean: 10.40%) in An. funestus, and between 5.55-22.22% (mean: 13.87%) in An. gambiae. This trend was confirmed by TaqMan assays, with P. falciparum infection prevalence of 23.33% in An. funestus. Significant decrease of mortality associated with high frequency of kdr mutation was observed in An. gambiae (deltamethrin: 36.6-56.45%; permethrin: 6-18.65%) indicating high level of resistance to pyrethroids. For An. funestus, resistance was marked for deltamethrin (mortality: 70.54-76.24%) than for permethrin (94.12-94.74%).
   Conclusions: Our study showed that despite LLINs, the population of Obout remains exposed to bites of highly infected An. funestus and An. gambiae mosquitoes, highlighting the challenges to controlling malaria in forested areas, especially in the presence of insecticide resistance.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum delayed clearance associated
   polymorphisms in adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (pfap2mu) and
   ubiquitin specific protease 1 (pfubp1) genes in Ghanaian isolates
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum delayed clearance with the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) has been reported in some African countries. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes, P. falciparum adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (pfap2mu) and ubiquitin specific protease 1 (pfubp1), have been linked to delayed clearance with ACT use in Kenya and recurrent imported malaria in Britain. With over 12 years of ACT use in Ghana, this study investigated the prevalence of SNPs in the pfap2mu and pfubp1 in Ghanaian clinical P. falciparum isolates to provide baseline data for antimalarial drug resistance surveillance in the country.
   Methods: Filter paper blood blots collected in 2015-2016 from children aged below 9 years presenting with uncomplicated malaria at hospitals in three sentinel sites Begoro, Cape Coast and Navrongo were used. Parasite DNA was extracted from 120 samples followed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). Sanger sequencing was performed to detect and identify SNPs in pfap2mu and pfubp1 genes.
   Results: In all, 11.1% (9/81) of the isolates carried the wildtype genotypes for both genes. A total of 164 pfap2mu mutations were detected in 67 isolates whilst 271 pfubp1 mutations were observed in 72 isolates. The majority of the mutations were non-synonymous (NS): 78% (128/164) for pfap2mu and 92.3% (250/271) for pfubp1. Five unique samples had a total of 215 pfap2mu SNPs, ranging between 15 and 63 SNPs per sample. Genotypes reportedly associated with ART resistance detected in this study included pfap2mu S160N (7.4%, 6/81) and pfubp1 E1528D (7.4%, 6/81) as well as D1525E (4.9%, 4/81). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of the SNPs between the three ecologically distinct study sites (pfap2mu: chi(2) = 6.905, df = 2, P = 0.546; pfubp1: chi(2) = 4.883, df = 2, P = 0.769).
   Conclusions: The detection of pfap2mu and pfubp1 genotypes associated with ACT delayed parasite clearance is evidence of gradual nascent emergence of resistance in Ghana. The results will serve as baseline data for surveillance and the selection of the genotypes with drug pressure over time. The pfap2mu S160N, pfubp1 E1528D and D1525E must be monitored in Ghanaian isolates in ACT susceptibility studies, especially when cure rates of ACTs, particularly AL, is less than 100%.

TI Uptake of intermittent preventive treatment and pregnancy outcomes:
   health facilities and community surveys in Chokwe district, southern
   Mozambique
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria in pregnancy leads to serious adverse effects on the mother and the child and accounts for 75,000-200,000 infant deaths every year. Currently, the World Health Organization recommends intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at each scheduled antenatal care (ANC) visit. This study aimed to assess IPTp-SP coverage in mothers delivering in health facilities and at the community. In addition, factors associated with low IPTp-SP uptake and malaria adverse outcomes in pregnancy were investigated.
   Methods: A community and a health facility-based surveys were conducted in mothers delivering in Chokwe district, southern Mozambique. Social-demographic data, malaria prevention practices and obstetric history were recorded through self-report and antenatal records. For women delivering at health facilities, a clinical examination of mother and child was performed, and malaria infection at delivery was determined by rapid diagnostic test, microscopy, quantitative PCR and placental histology.
   Results: Of 1141 participants, 46.6, 30.2, 13.5 and 9.6% reported taking >= 3, two, one and none SP doses, respectively. Low IPTp uptake (< 3 doses) was associated with non-institutional deliveries (AOR = 2.9, P < 0.001), first ANC visit after week 28 (AOR = 5.4, P < 0.001), low awareness of IPTp-SP (AOR = 1.6, P < 0.002) and having no or only primary education (AOR = 1.3, P = 0.041). The overall prevalence of maternal malaria (peripheral and/or placental) was 16.8% and was higher among women from rural areas compared to those from urban areas (AOR = 1.9, P < 0.001). Younger age (< 20 years; AOR = 1.6, P = 0.042) and living in rural areas (AOR = 1.9, P < 0.001) were predictors of maternal malaria at delivery. Being primigravidae (AOR = 2.2, P = 0.023) and preterm delivery (AOR = 2.6, P < 0.001) predicted low birth weight while younger age was also associated with premature delivery (AOR = 1.4, P = 0.031).
   Conclusion: The coverage for two and >= 3 doses of IPTp-SP is moderately higher than estimates from routine health facility records in Gaza province in 2015. However, this is still far below the national target of 80% for >= 3 doses. Ongoing campaigns aiming to increase the use of malaria prevention strategies during pregnancy should particularly target rural populations, increasing IPTp-SP knowledge, stimulate early visits to ANC, improve access to health services and the quality of the service provided.

TI Reactive case detection of Plasmodium falciparum in western Kenya
   highlands: effective in identifying additional cases, yet limited effect
   on transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Identifying asymptomatic reservoirs of malaria parasites using index cases as entry points into the community is potentially a cost-effective way towards achieving malaria elimination.
   Methods: Within 1 year, 1430 confirmed malaria cases were identified in Marani hospital, western Kenya. Fifty cases were followed up, and 108 index case household members and 612 neighbours within a 100 m radius were screened. As controls, samples were collected from 510 individuals matched with index cases and located at a distance of >= 500 m from them. Infections were diagnosed by microscopy and PCR while simultaneously collecting malaria vectors indoor using pyrethrum spray catches.
   Results: In the index case and neighbour households, the prevalence of infection was approximately twice as high as in control households (by PCR: index cases households: 28.9%, neighbours: 25.3%, matched controls: 12.9%). In index case households, the indoor vector density (Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus) was higher (0.46 female/house/night) than in neighbouring (0.31 f/h/n) and control houses (0.29 f/h/n).
   Conclusions: Screening index case households and neighbours approximately doubles the chance to detect asymptomatic infections compared to randomly selected households. However, even if all cases were followed up, only a small proportion (<10%) of the asymptomatic reservoir in the population would have been identified. Control programmes need to weigh the increased chance to find cases around index cases vs. the logistical challenges to target this subgroup within the population.

TI Prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency among
   malaria patients in Upper Myanmar
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1.1.49) deficiency is one of the most common X-linked recessive hereditary disorders in the world. Primaquine (PQ) has been used for radical cure of P. vivax to prevent relapse. Recently, it is also used to reduce P. falciparum gametocyte carriage to block transmission. However, PQ metabolites oxidize hemoglobin and generate excessive reactive oxygen species which can trigger acute hemolytic anemia in malaria patients with inherited G6PD deficiency.
   Methods: A total of 252 blood samples collected from malaria patients in Myanmar were used in this study. G6PD variant was analysed by a multiplex allele specific PCR kit, DiaPlexC (TM) G6PD Genotyping Kit [Asian type]. The accuracy of the multiplex allele specific PCR was confirmed by sequencing analysis.
   Results: Prevalence and distribution of G6PD variants in 252 malaria patients in Myanmar were analysed. Six different types of G6PD allelic variants were identified in 50 (7 females and 43 males) malaria patients. The predominant variant was Mahidol (68%, 34/50), of which 91.2% (31/34) and 8.8% (3/34) were males and females, respectively. Other G6PD variants including Kaiping (18%, 9/50), Viangchan (6%, 3/50), Mediterranean (4%, 2/50), Union (2%, 1/50) and Canton (2%, 1/50) were also observed.
   Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that more concern for proper and safe use of PQ as a radical cure of malaria in Myanmar is needed by combining G6PD deficiency test before PQ prescription. Establishment of a follow-up system to monitor potential PQ toxicity in malaria patients who are given PQ is also required.

TI Low risk of recurrence following artesunate-Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
   plus primaquine for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
   vivax infections in the Republic of the Sudan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: First-line schizontocidal treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the Republic of the Sudan is artesunate (total dose 12 mg/kg) plus Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (25/1.25 mg/kg) (AS/SP). Patients with Plasmodium vivax are also treated with 14 days primaquine (total dose 3.5 mg/kg) (PQ). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the national policy.
   Methods: Patients above 1 year, with microscopy-confirmed, Plasmodium falciparum and/or P. vivax malaria were treated with AS/SP. Patients with P. falciparum were randomized to no primaquine (Pf-noPQ) or a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of PQ (Pf-PQ1). Patients with P. vivax received 14 days unsupervised 3.5 mg/kg PQ (Pv-PQ14) on day 2 or at the end of follow up (Pv-noPQ). Primary endpoint was the risk of recurrent parasitaemia at day 42. G6PD activity was measured by spectrophotometry and the Accessbio Biosensor T.
   Results: 231 patients with P. falciparum (74.8%), 77 (24.9%) with P. vivax and 1 (0.3%) patient with mixed infection were enrolled. The PCR corrected cumulative risk of recurrent parasitaemia on day 42 was 3.8% (95% CI 1.2-11.2%) in the Pf-noPQ arm compared to 0.9% (95% CI 0.1-6.0%) in the Pf-PQ1 arm; (HR = 0.25 [95% CI 0.03-2.38], p = 0.189). The corresponding risks of recurrence were 13.4% (95% CI 5.2-31.9%) in the Pv-noPQ arm and 5.3% (95% CI 1.3-19.4%) in the Pv-PQ14 arm (HR 0.36 [95% CI 0.1-2.0], p = 0.212). Two (0.9%) patients had G6PD enzyme activity below 10%, 19 (8.9%) patients below 60% of the adjusted male median. Correlation between spectrophotometry and Biosensor T was low -(rs = 0.330, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: AS/SP remains effective for the treatment of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The addition of PQ reduced the risk of recurrent P. falciparum and P. vivax by day 42, although this did not reach statistical significance. The version of the Biosensor T assessed is not suitable for routine use.

TI Understanding human genetic factors influencing primaquine safety and
   efficacy to guide primaquine roll-out in a pre-elimination setting in
   southern Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Primaquine (PQ) is recommended as an addition to standard malaria treatments in pre-elimination settings due to its pronounced activity against mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, the parasite stage responsible for onward transmission to mosquitoes. However, PQ may trigger haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient individuals. Additional human genetic factors, including polymorphisms in the human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) complex, may negatively influence the efficacy of PQ. This study assessed the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and two important CYP2D6 variants in representative pre-elimination settings in South Africa, to inform malaria elimination strategies.
   Methods: Volunteers (n = 248) attending six primary health care facilities in a malaria-endemic region of South Africa were enrolled between October and November 2015. G6PD status was determined phenotypically, using a CareStart (TM) G6PD rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and genotypically for two common African G6PD variants, namely A+ (A376G) and A-(G202A, A542T, G680T & T968C) by PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*17 variants were determined with PCR and RFLP.
   Results: A prevalence of 13% (33/248) G6PD deficiency was observed in the cohort by G6PD RDT whilst by genotypic assessment, 32% (79/248) were A+ and 3.2% were A-, respectively. Among the male participants, 11% (6/55) were G6PD A-hemizygous; among females 1% (2/193) were G6PD A-homozygous and 16% (32/193) G6PD A-heterozygous. The strength of agreement between phenotyping and genotyping result was fair (Cohens Kappa. = 0.310). The negative predictive value for the G6PD RDT for detecting hemizygous, homozygous and heterozygous individuals was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), compared to the more sensitive genotyping. The CYP2D6*4 allele frequencies for CYP2D6*4 (inferred poor metabolizer phenotype) and CYP2D6*17 (inferred intermediate metabolizer phenotype) were 3.2 and 19.5%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Phenotypic and genotypic analyses both detected low prevalence of G6PD deficiency and the CYP2D6*4 variants. These findings, combined with increasing data confirming safety of single low-dose PQ in individuals with African variants of G6PD deficiency, supports the deployment of single low-dose PQ as a gametocytocidal drug. PQ would pose minimal risks to the study populations and could be a useful elimination strategy in the study area.

TI High proportions of asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium vivax
   infections in a peri-urban area of low transmission in the Brazilian
   Amazon
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Population-based studies conducted in Latin America have shown a high proportion of asymptomatic and submicroscopic malarial infections. Considering efforts aiming at regional elimination, it is important to investigate the role of this asymptomatic reservoir in malaria transmission in peri-urban areas. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. and gametocyte burden on symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Results: Two cross-sectional household surveys (CS) were conducted including all inhabitants in a peri-urban area of Manaus, western Amazonas State, Brazil. Malaria parasites were detected by light microscopy (LM) and qPCR. Sexual stages of Plasmodium spp. were detected by LM and RT-qPCR. A total of 4083 participants were enrolled during the two surveys. In CS1, the prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infections was 4.3% (86/2010) by qPCR and 1. 6% (32/2010) by LM. Fifty percent (43/86) of P. vivax infected individuals (qPCR) carried P. vivax gametocytes. In CS2, 3.4% (70/2073) of participants had qPCR-detectable P. vivax infections, of which 42.9% (30/70) of infections were gametocyte positive. The P. vivax parasite density was associated with gametocyte carriage (P < 0.001). Sixty-seven percent of P. vivax infected individuals and 53.4% of P. vivax gametocyte carriers were asymptomatic.
   Conclusions: This study confirms a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and submicroscopic P. vivax infections in the study area. Most asymptomatic individuals carried gametocytes and presented low asexual parasitemia. This reservoir actively contributes to malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon, underscoring a need to implement more efficient control and elimination strategies.

TI Malaria diagnosis by PCR revealed differential distribution of mono and
   mixed species infections by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in India
SO PLOS ONE
AB Malaria is a vector-borne infectious disease, caused by five different species of the genus Plasmodium, and is endemic to many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the globe. At present, malaria diagnosis at the primary health care level in India is conducted by either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In recent years, molecular diagnosis (by PCR assay), has emerged as the most sensitive method for malaria diagnosis. India is highly endemic to malaria and shoulders the burden of two major malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Previous studies using PCR diagnostic assay had unraveled several interesting facts on distribution of malaria parasites in India. However, these studies had several limitations from small sample size to limited geographical areas of sampling. In order to mitigate these limitations, we have collected finger-prick blood samples from 2,333 malaria symptomatic individuals in nine states from 11 geographic locations, covering almost the entire malaria endemic regions of India and performed all the three diagnostic tests (microscopy, RDT and PCR assay) and also have conducted comparative assessment on the performance of the three diagnostic tests. Since PCR assay turned out to be highly sensitive (827 malaria positive cases) among the three types of tests, we have utilized data from PCR diagnostic assay for analyses and inferences. The results indicate varied distributional prevalence of P. vivaxand P. falciparum according to locations in India, and also the mixed species infection due to these two species. The proportion of P. falciparum to P. vivax was found to be 49:51, and percentage of mixed species infections due to these two parasites was found to be 13% of total infections. Considering India is set for malaria elimination by 2030, the present malaria epidemiological information is of high importance.

TI Emergence of Nonfalciparum Plasmodium Infection Despite Regular
   Artemisinin Combination Therapy in an 18-Month Longitudinal Study of
   Ugandan Children and Their Mothers
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB As part of a longitudinal cohort investigation of intestinal schistosomiasis and malaria in Ugandan children and their mothers on the shorelines of Lakes Victoria and Albert, we documented risk factors and morbidity associated with nonfalciparum Plasmodium infections and the longitudinal dynamics of Plasmodium species in children. Host age, household location, and Plasmodium falciparum infection were strongly associated with nonfalciparum Plasmodium infections, and Plasmodium malariae infection was associated with splenomegaly. Despite regular artemisinin combination therapy treatment, there was a 3-fold rise in P. malariae prevalence, which was not accountable for by increasing age of the child. Worryingly, our findings reveal the consistent emergence of nonfalciparum infections in children, highlighting the complex dynamics underlying multispecies infections here. Given the growing body of evidence that nonfalciparum malaria infections cause significant morbidity, we encourage better surveillance for nonfalciparum Plasmodium infections, particularly in children, with more sensitive DNA detection methods and improved field-based diagnostics.

TI Treatment of uncomplicated and severe malaria during pregnancy
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Over the past 10 years, the available evidence on the treatment of malaria during pregnancy has increased substantially. Owing to their relative ease of use, good sensitivity and specificity, histidine rich protein 2 based rapid diagnostic tests are appropriate for symptomatic pregnant women; however, such tests are less appropriate for systematic screening because they will not detect an important proportion of infections among asymptomatic women. The effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs varies greatly between studies and class of antimalarial drugs, emphasising the need for prospective studies in pregnant and non-pregnant women. For the treatment of malaria during the first trimester, international guidelines are being reviewed by WHO. For the second and third trimester of pregnancy, results from several trials have confirmed that artemisinin-based combination treatments are safe and efficacious, although tolerability and efficacy might vary by treatment. It is now essential to translate such evidence into policies and clinical practice that benefit pregnant women in countries where malaria is endemic. Access to parasitological diagnosis or appropriate antimalarial treatment remains low in many countries and regions. Therefore, there is a pressing need for research to identify quality improvement interventions targeting pregnant women and health providers. In addition, efficient and practical systems for pharmacovigilance are needed to further expand knowledge on the safety of antimalarial drugs, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy.

TI Burden, pathology, and costs of malaria in pregnancy: new developments
   for an old problem
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Over the past 10 years, knowledge of the burden, economic costs, and consequences of malaria in pregnancy has improved, and the prevalence of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum has declined substantially in some geographical areas. In particular, studies outside of Africa have increased the evidence base of Plasmodium vivax in pregnancy. Rapid diagnostic tests have been poor at detecting malaria in pregnant women, while PCR has shown a high prevalence of low density infection, the clinical importance of which is unknown. Erythrocytes infected with P falciparum that express the surface protein VAR2CSA accumulate in the placenta, and VAR2CSA is an important target of protective immunity. Clinical trials for a VAR2CSA vaccine are ongoing, but sequence variation needs to be carefully studied. Health system and household costs still limit access to prevention and treatment services. Within the context of malaria elimination, pregnant women could be used to monitor malaria transmission. This Series paper summarises recent progress and highlights unresolved issues related to the burden of malaria in pregnancy.

TI Next-Generation Sequencing and Bioinformatics Protocol for Malaria Drug
   Resistance Marker Surveillance
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB The recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide a new and effective way of tracking malaria drug-resistant parasites. To take advantage of this technology, an end-to-end Illumina targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) and bioinformatics pipeline for molecular surveillance of drug resistance in P. falciparum, called malaria resistance surveillance (MaRS), was developed. TADS relies on PCR enriching genomic regions, specifically target genes of interest, prior to deep sequencing. MaRS enables researchers to simultaneously collect data on allele frequencies of multiple full-length P. falciparum drug resistance genes (crt, mdr1, k13, dhfr, dhps, and the cytochrome b gene), as well as the mitochondrial genome. Information is captured at the individual patient level for both known and potential new single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with drug resistance. The MaRS pipeline was validated using 245 imported malaria cases that were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The chloroquine resistance crt CVIET genotype (mutations underlined) was observed in 42% of samples, the highly pyrimethamine-resistant dhps IRN triple mutant in 92% of samples, and the sulfadoxine resistance dhps mutation SGEAA in 26% of samples. The mdr1 NFSND genotype was found in 40% of samples. With the exception of two cases imported from Cambodia, no artemisinin resistance k13 alleles were identified, and 99% of patients carried parasites susceptible to atovaquone-proguanil. Our goal is to implement MaRS at the CDC for routine surveillance of imported malaria cases in the United States and to aid in the adoption of this system at participating state public health laboratories, as well as by global partners.

TI Clinical Outcomes of Submicroscopic Infections and Correlates of
   Protection of VAR2CSA Antibodies in a Longitudinal Study of Pregnant
   Women in Colombia
SO INFECTION AND IMMUNITY
AB Malaria in pregnancy can cause serious adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus. However, little is known about the effects of submicroscopic infections (SMIs) in pregnancy, particularly in areas where Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax cocirculate. A cohort of 187 pregnant women living in Puerto Libertador in northwest Colombia was followed longitudinally from recruitment to delivery. Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and placental histopathology. Gestational age, hemoglobin concentration, VAR2CSA-specific IgG levels, and adhesion-blocking antibodies were measured during pregnancy. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of SMIs on birth weight and other delivery outcomes. Twenty-five percent of women (45/180) were positive for SMIs during pregnancy. Forty-seven percent of infections (21/45) were caused by P. falciparum, 33% were caused by P. vivax, and 20% were caused by mixed Plasmodium spp. Mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax were associated with lower gestational age at delivery (P = 0.0033), while other outcomes were normal. Over 60% of women had antibodies to VAR2CSA, and there was no difference in antibody levels between those with and without SMIs. The anti-adhesion function of these antibodies was associated with protection from SMI-related anemia at delivery (P = 0.0086). SMIs occur frequently during pregnancy, and while mixed infections of both P. falciparum and P. vivax were not associated with a decrease in birth weight, they were associated with significant risk of preterm birth. We propose that the lack of adverse delivery outcomes is due to functional VAR2CSA antibodies that can protect pregnant women from SMI-related anemia.

TI Trichomonas vaginalis cathepsin D-like aspartic proteinase (Tv-CatD) is
   positively regulated by glucose and degrades human hemoglobin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY
AB Trichomonas vaginalis genome encodes 440 proteases, six of which are aspartic proteases (APs). However, only one belongs to a clan AA (EC 3.4.23.5), family A1 (pepsin A), cathepsin D-like protease. This AP is encoded by an 1113-bp gene (tv-catd), which translates into a 370-aa residues zymogen of 40.7-kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.6, generating a similar to 35 kDa active enzyme after maturation (Tv-CatD). The goal of this study was to identify and analyze the effect of glucose on the expression of Tv-CatD at the transcript and protein levels, subcellular localization, and proteolytic activity. The qRT-PCR assays showed a similar to 2-fold increase in tv-catd mRNA under high glucose (HG) conditions compared to glucose-restriction (GR) conditions. We amplified, cloned, and expressed the tv-catd gene, and purified the recombinant precursor enzyme (Tv-CatDr) to generate a polyclonal antibody (anti-Tv-CatDr). Western blot (WB) and immunolocalization assays showed that glucose increases the amount of Tv-CatD in different subcellular localizations and in in vitro secretions. Additionally, Tv-CatD proteolytic activity was detected in protease-resistant extracts (PREs) using a synthetic fluorogenic peptide specific for cathepsin D/E APs at different pHs and in the presence of AP inhibitors. In a two-dimensional (2-DE) WB analysis of a PRE from parasites grown under GR and HG conditions, an anti-Tv-CatDr antibody detected a 35-kDa protein spot at pI 5.0 identified as the mature Tv-CatD form by mass spectrometry that showed proteolytic activity in 2-DE zymograms copolymerized with hemoglobin under both glucose conditions. Thus, Tv-CatD could be involved in trichomonal hemolysis.

TI Chemical Profile and Biological Activities of the Aerial Parts of
   Senecio acaulis (L.f.) Sch.Bip
SO PHARMACOGNOSY RESEARCH
AB Background: Genus Seneciois known by its phenolic constituents, terpenoids, essential oil (ED), and pyrrolizidine alkaloids. No previous reports could be traced about the phytochemical study of Senecio acaulis. Objectives: To investigate the chemical composition and biological potentiality of EO of S. acaulis aerial parts and to study the phytoconstituents of the plant extract and its spasmolytic activity. Materials and Methods: The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. In-vitro screen of antimicrobial, antimalarial, and antileishmanial activities was determined against positive controls. Column chromatography was used to isolate the phytoconstituents from chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions; their structures were elucidated using physical and spectral methods. Spasmolytic activity was measured before and after K+-induced contractions on isolated rabbit jejunum. DNA-fingerprint was established by RAPD-PCR technique using 12 primers. Results: The study of EO revealed the detection of 22 compounds representing 81.08% of the oil composition. The major constituents were D-limonene (13.32%), beta-pinene (11.54%), and sabinene (10.79%). Eight compounds were isolated from the plant extract and identified as beta-amyrin, beta-sitosterol, lupeol, oleanolic acid, beta-amyrin-3-O-beta-glucopyranoside, isorhamnetin beta-O-beta-glucopyranoside, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin. The oil exhibited moderate antimalarial activity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The oil showed a significant antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Cryptococcus neoformans and weak antileishmanial activity. In isolated rabbit jejunum, the ethanol extract produced a relaxation of spontaneous and moderate effect against high K+ (80 mM)-induced contractions. Amplification of DNA yielded 87 RAPD fragments. Conclusion: Senecio acaulis (L.f.) Sch.Bip essential oil can be used as antimicrobial agent against Staphylococcus aureus and Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, the spasmolytic activity of its ethanolic extract suggests its incorporation in antidiarrheal preparations. Further clinical trials are required to evaluate these effects on humans. Identification of twenty two compounds in its essential oil, isolation of eight compounds for the first time as well as authentication of the plant via DNA finger print may play an important role in its chemotaxonomic classification.

TI Unraveling Haplotype Diversity of the Apical Membrane Antigen-1 Gene in
   Plasmodium falciparum Populations in Thailand
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Development of an effective vaccine is critically needed for the prevention of malaria. One of the key antigens for malaria vaccines is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the surface protein for erythrocyte invasion of the parasite. The gene encoding AMA-1 has been sequenced from populations of P. falciparum worldwide, but the haplotype diversity of the gene in P. falciparum populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Thailand, remains to be characterized. In the present study, the AMA-1 gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from the genomic DNA of 65 P. falciparum isolates from 5 endemic areas in Thailand. The nearly full-length 1,848 nucleotide sequence of AMA-1 was subjected to molecular analyses, including nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity and neutrality tests. Phylogenetic analysis and pair-wise population differentiation (F-st indices) were performed to infer the population structure. The analyses identified 60 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, predominately located in domain I of AMA-1. A total of 31 unique AMA-1 haplotypes were identified, which included 11 novel ones. The phylogenetic tree of the AMA-1 haplotypes revealed multiple clades of AMA-1, each of which contained parasites of multiple geographical origins, consistent with the F-st indices indicating genetic homogeneity or gene flow among geographically distinct populations of P. falciparum in Thailand's borders with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. In summary, the study revealed novel haplotypes and population structure needed for the further advancement of AMA-1-based malaria vaccines in the GMS.

TI The Effect of ABO Blood Groups, Hemoglobinopathy, and Heme Oxygenase-1
   Polymorphisms on Malaria Susceptibility and Severity
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Malaria is one of the most important public health problems in tropical areas on the globe. Several factors are associated with susceptibility to malaria and disease severity, including innate immunity such as blood group, hemoglobinopathy, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) polymorphisms. This study was carried out to investigate association among ABO blood group, thalassemia types and HO-1 polymorphisms in malaria. The malarial blood samples were collected from patients along the Thai-Myanmar border. Determination of ABO blood group, thalassemia variants, and HO-1 polymorphisms were performed using agglutination test, low pressure liquid chromatography and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Plasmodium vivax was the major infected malaria species in the study samples. Distribution of ABO blood type in the malaria-infected samples was similar to that in healthy subjects, of which blood type O being most prevalent. Association between blood group A and decreased risk of severe malaria was significant. Six thalassemia types (30%) were detected, i.e., hemoglobin E (HbE), beta-thalassemia, alpha-thalassemia 1, alpha-thalassemia 2, HbE with alpha-thalassemia 2, and beta-thalassemia with alpha-thalassemia 2. Malaria infected samples without thalassemia showed significantly higher risk to severe malaria. The prevalence of HO-1 polymorphisms, S/S, S/L and L/L were 25, 62, and 13%, respectively. Further study with larger sample size is required to confirm the impact of these 3 host genetic factors in malaria patients.

TI Association of Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) Alterations in Malaria
   Susceptibility and Severity: A Tribal Population Based Study in the
   Malaria Endemic State of Assam, India
SO JOURNAL OF KRISHNA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITY
AB Background: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are group of trans-membrane proteins that recognizes specific molecular pattern and activates the downstream cytokines for the efficient clearance of pathogens. Objectives: To evaluate the role of TLR9 1486T/C polymorphism and its association with the malarial pathogenicity and severity. Material and Methods: Present study was a cohort based study and a total number of 150 samples were drawn from three major tribal population group's viz., Karbi, Dimasa and Boro-Kachari. TLR9 (1486T/C) gene polymorphism was assessed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Differential TLR9 m-RNA expression was assessed using Real time PCR (RT-PCR). Results: TLR9 1486T/C genotype variant showed increased risk for the susceptibility of malarial infection (p= 0.141) compared to controls. The variant genotype showed significant increased risk with susceptibility to severe malaria infection (p=0.047) compared to uncomplicated malaria (UC-M). TLR9 mRNA level expression showed up-regulation in UC-M compared to controls. Decreased TLR9 expression was found in SM cases compared to UC-M (p=0.312). Significant down-regulation of TLR9 gene was found in UC-M with variant C genotype cases compared to wild types (p=0.039). Conclusion: Our finding indicates the association of the TLR9 gene polymorphism and linked differential expression modulation in the development of malarial pathogenicity.

TI Palaeoparasitology and palaeogenetics: review and perspectives for the
   study of ancient human parasites
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB While some species of parasites can be identified to species level from archaeological remains using microscopy (i.e. Enterobius vermicularis, Clonorchis sinensis), others can only be identified to family or genus level as different species produce eggs with similar morphology (i.e. Taenia sp. and Echinococcus sp.). Molecular and immunological approaches offer the possibility to provide more precise determination at the species level. They can also identify taxa when classic parasite markers such as eggs or cysts have been destroyed over time. However, biomolecules can be poorly preserved and modern reference DNA is available only for a limited number of species of parasites, leading to the conclusion that classic microscopic observation should be combined with molecular analyses. Here we present a review of the molecular approaches used over the past two decades to identify human pathogenic helminths (Ascaris sp., Trichuris sp., E. vermicularis, Fasciola sp. etc.) or protists (Giardia sp., Trypanosoma sp., Leishmania sp. etc.). We also discuss the prospects for studying the evolution of parasites with genetics and genomics.

TI Determination of Imported Malaria Cases in Hatay by the Use of Molecular
   Methods
SO MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB Malaria, being among the most important diseases throughout history, is still an important public health problem among parasitic diseases due to increasing population movements with various reasons such as migration, war and travel. According to WHO data each year 300-350 million people get exposed to malaria, each year 1.5-2.7 million people die from malaria and also 40% of the world's population is still at risk for this disease. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) data, imported cases were not reported since 2013 in our country. However among imported cases Plasmodium falciparum malaria can be observed. The aim of this study wasto draw attention to the imported malaria cases increasing gradually and to the importance of the chemoprophylaxis in terms of malaria before travelling. In the study, male patients who have admitted to Hatay Province Malaria Center or Mustafa Kemal University Infectious Disease Department, ages between 25-60 years, were analyzed. All of the patients have worked abroad before. Patients were mostly from Sudan but there were also patients from endemic regions such as Africa, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mali island. The cases were evaluated according to age, gender and whether they had travel stories in Turkey or abroad. Blood samples taken from the patients were firstly prepared by thin and thick smear preparations and examined microscopically by staining with Giemsa stain method. Samples that were found positive by microscopic examination were impregnated on drying papers and genotyped using nested-PCR. Out of the 30 samples from patients who had traveled to endemic countries before, determined as positive by microscopical examination and genotyped by nested-PCR, 16 of them were identified as P.falciparum, six of them as P.vivax and eight of them as P.falciparum/ P.vivax. The study suggested that malaria prophylaxis has to be applied before travelling to endemic countries, in return imported malaria has to be considered one of the first diseases in mind and people who will travel should be informed about this disease before travel.

TI Competing for blood: the ecology of parasite resource competition in
   human malaria-helminth co-infections
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB Ecological theory suggests that co-infecting parasite species can interact within hosts directly, via host immunity and/or via resource competition. In mice, competition for red blood cells (RBCs) between malaria and bloodsucking helminths can regulate malaria population dynamics, but the importance of RBC competition in human hosts was unknown. We analysed infection density (i.e. the concentration of parasites in infected hosts), from a 2-year deworming study of over 4000 human subjects. After accounting for resource-use differences among parasites, we find evidence of resource competition, priority effects and a competitive hierarchy within co-infected individuals. For example reducing competition via deworming increased Plasmodium vivax densities 2.8-fold, and this effect is limited to bloodsucking hookworms. Our ecological, resource-based perspective sheds new light into decades of conflicting outcomes of malaria-helminth co-infection studies with significant health and transmission consequences. Beyond blood, investigating within-human resource competition may bring new insights for improving human health.

TI The Role of Molecular Techniques on Malaria Control and Elimination
   Programs in Iran: A Review Article
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: The aim of this review was to describe the application of molecular methods in epidemiological aspects of malaria vectors, parasites, and human hosts in Iran and their critical role in malaria control and elimination programs.
   Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically for original published papers on PCR, the molecular identification of malaria vectors, the molecular epidemiology of malaria, insecticide resistance, and drug-resistant parasites, in Iran. In total, 51 studies on molecular entomology and 36 studies on molecular parasitology of malaria and three on human host were selected.
   Results: Molecular methods are essential for improving the detection of malaria infection and monitoring antimalarial drugs and insecticide resistance in malaria elimination settings such as Iran.
   Conclusion: The application of molecular methods may be of particular interest for malaria control/elimination programs, for monitoring progress towards malaria elimination, and for optimal orientation of program activities.

TI Severe Cerebral Falciparum Malaria with Dengue Coinfection: A Case
   Report
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB A rare severe case of the coinfection of cerebral falciparum malaria and dengue is reported in this paper. The patient was a 50 yr old male in the north of China, who returned from Uganda not long ago and suffered unconsciousness after fever for 4 d before the falciparum malaria and dengue infection was diagnosed via blood smear microscopy, RT-PCR and serology, although the antimalarial and symptomatic treatment was carried out, ultimately the patients died of septic shock because of multiple organ dysfunctions. This case report showed such a coinfection was prone to cause severe acute consequence. The timely diagnosis and delicate treatment are crucial for prognosis of patients.

TI Plasmodium knowlesi infection in a returning German traveller from
   Thailand: a case report on an emerging malaria pathogen in a popular
   low-risk travel destination
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Thailand is a major destination for German travellers with more than 760,000 arrivals in 2015. At the same time, malaria is a concern in travel recommendations with regard to this destination. The World Malaria Report of 2016 mentions only P. falciparum and P. vivax as prevalent species for Thailand, however, P. knowlesi infections have been occasionally reported in Thailand. In German travellers, only five cases of P. knowlesi infections have been reported to date.
   Case presentation: A 45-year-old German male tourist travelled to Thailand from 25 December 2016 to 13 January 2017. On 14 January he developed fever with no other symptoms, and presented on 17 January at the Division for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases in Munich, Germany. Malaria was diagnosed, primarily based on a single parasite in the thin smear microscopy, while commercial rapid diagnostic testing remained negative. Only the result of a differential PCR assay revealed P. knowlesi infection.
   Conclusions: P. knowlesi has to be considered in travellers returning from Thailand. Cases may present with an extremely low parasitaemia. This is in contrast to the assumption that P. knowlesi was likely to cause high parasitaemia due to its short replication cycle.

TI Streamlined, PCR-based testing for pfhrp2- and pfhrp3-negative
   Plasmodium falciparum
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that detect histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) are used throughout Africa for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, recent reports indicate that parasites lacking the pfhrp2 and/or histidine-rich protein 3 (pfhrp3) genes, which produce antigens detected by these RDTs, are common in select regions of South America, Asia, and Africa. Proving the absence of a gene is challenging, and multiple PCR assays targeting these genes have been described. A detailed characterization and comparison of published assays is needed to facilitate robust and streamlined testing approaches.
   Results: Among six pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 PCR assays tested, the lower limit of detection ranged from 0.01 pg/mu L to 0.1 ng/mu L of P. falciparum 3D7 strain DNA, or approximately 0.4-4000 parasite genomes/mu L. By lowering the elongation temperature to 60 degrees C, a tenfold improvement in the limit of detection and/or darker bands for all exon 1 targets and for the first-round reaction of a single exon 2 target was achieved. Additionally, assays targeting exon 1 of either gene yielded spurious amplification of the paralogous gene. Using these data, an optimized testing algorithm for the detection of pfhrp2- and pfhrp3-negative P. falciparum is proposed.
   Conclusions: Surveillance of pfhrp2-and pfhrp3-negative P. falciparum requires careful laboratory workflows. PCR-based testing methods coupled with microscopy and/or antigen testing serve as useful tools to support policy development. Standardized approaches to the detection of pfhrp2-and pfhrp3-negative P. falciparum should inform efforts to define the impact of these parasites.

TI Micro-epidemiology of mixed-species malaria infections in a rural
   population living in the Colombian Amazon region
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria outbreaks have been reported in recent years in the Colombian Amazon region, malaria has been re-emerging in areas where it was previously controlled. Information from malaria transmission networks and knowledge about the population characteristics influencing the dispersal of parasite species is limited. This study aimed to determine the distribution patterns of Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum single and mixed infections, as well as the significant socio-spatial groupings relating to the appearance of such infections. An active search in 57 localities resulted in 2,106 symptomatic patients being enrolled. Parasitaemia levels were assessed by optical microscopy, and parasites were detected by PCR. The association between mixed infections (in 43.2% of the population) and socio-spatial factors was modelled using logistic regression and multiple correspondence analyses. P. vivax occurred most frequently (71.0%), followed by P. malariae (43.2%), in all localities. The results suggest that a parasite density-dependent regulation model (with fever playing a central role) was appropriate for modelling the frequency of mixed species infections in this population. This study highlights the under-reporting of Plasmodium spp. mixed infections in the malaria-endemic area of the Colombian Amazon region and the association between causative and environmental factors in such areas.

TI Pyronaridine-artesunate or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus current
   first-line therapies for repeated treatment of uncomplicated malaria: a
   randomised, multicentre, open-label, longitudinal, controlled, phase
   3b/4 trial
SO LANCET
AB Background Arte
   mether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine are used as first-line artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in west Africa. Pyronaridine-artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine are potentially useful for diversification of ACTs in this region, but further safety and efficacy data are required on malaria retreatment. Methods We did a randomised, multicentre, open-label, longitudinal, controlled phase 3b/4 clinical trial at seven tertiary centres in Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali. Eligible participants for first malaria episode and all retreatment episodes were adults and children aged 6 months and older with microscopically confirmed Plasmodium spp malaria (>0 to <200 000 parasites per mu L of blood) and fever or history of fever in the previous 24 h. Individuals with severe or complicated malaria, an alanine aminotransferase concentration of more than twice the upper limit of normal, or a QTc greater than 450 ms were excluded. Using a randomisation list for each site, masked using sealed envelopes, participants were assigned to either pyronaridine-artesunate or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus either artesunate-amodiaquine or artemether-lumefantrine. Block sizes were two or four if two treatments were allocated, and three or six if three treatments were allocated. Microscopists doing the parasitological assessments were masked to treatment allocation. All treatments were once-daily or twice-daily tablets or granules given orally and dosed by bodyweight over 3 days at the study centre. Patients were followed up as outpatients up to day 42, receiving clinical assessments on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Two primary outcomes were compared for non-inferiority: the 2-year incidence rate of all microscopically confirmed, complicated and uncomplicated malaria episodes in patients in the intention-to-treat population (ITT; non-inferiority margin 20%); and adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in uncomplicated malaria across all episodes (unadjusted and PCR-adjusted for Plasmodium falciparum and unadjusted for other Plasmodium spp) in the per-protocol population on days 28 and 42 (non-inferiority margin 5%). Safety was assessed in all participants who received one dose of study drug. This study is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201105000286876).
   Findings Between Oct 24, 2011, and Feb 1, 2016, we assigned 4710 eligible participants to the different treatment strategies: 1342 to pyronaridine-artesunate, 967 to artemether-lumefantrine, 1061 to artesunate-amodiaquine, and 1340 to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The 2-year malaria incidence rate in the ITT population was non-inferior for pyronaridine-artesunate versus artemether-lumefantrine (1.77, 95% CI 1.63-1.93 vs 1.87, 1.72-2.03; rate ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.17); and versus artesunate-amodiaquine (1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.59 vs 1.35, 1.18-1.54; RR 0.97, 0.87-1.07). Similarly, this endpoint was non-inferior for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine (1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.34 vs 1.42 1.25-1.62; RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41) and versus artesunate-amodiaquine (1.35, 1.21-1.51 vs 1.68, 1.51-1.88; RR 1.25, 1.02-1.50). For uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, PCR-adjusted ACPR was greater than 99.5% at day 28 and greater than 98.6% at day 42 for all ACTs; unadjusted ACPR was higher for pyronaridine-artesunate versus comparators at day 28 (96.9% vs 82.3% for artemether-lumefantrine and 95.6% vs 89.0% for artesunate-amodiaquine) and for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus comparators (99.5% vs 81.6% for artemether-lumefantrine and 99.0% vs 89.0% for artesunate-amodiaquine). For non-falciparum species, unadjusted ACPR was greater than 98% for all study drugs at day 28 and at day 42 was greater than 83% except for artemether-lumefantrine against Plasmodium ovale (in ten [62.5%] of 16 patients) and against Plasmodium malariae (in nine [75.0%] of 12 patients). Nine deaths occurred during the study, none of which were related to the study treatment. Mostly mild transient elevations in transaminases occurred with pyronaridine-artesunate versus comparators, and mild QTcF prolongation with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus comparators.
   Interpretation Pyronaridine-artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment and retreatment of malaria were well tolerated with efficacy that was non-inferior to first-line ACTs. Greater access to these efficacious treatments in west Africa is justified. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Seasonal abundance, blood meal sources and insecticide susceptibility in
   major anopheline malaria vectors from southern Mauritania
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Malaria is endemic in the southernmost Sahelian zone of Mauritania where the major known mosquito vector is Anopheles arabiensis. Understanding seasonal population dynamics, feeding preferences and insecticide resistance status of these vectors in the area is essential to improve vector control measures implemented at a local scale. Here, malaria vector populations' bionomics is described in two sentinel sites located in the Sahelian zone of Mauritania.
   Methods: Between September 2014 and December 2016, longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted in Kobeni (15 degrees 49'N, 09 degrees 24'W) and Rosso (16 degrees 30'N; 15 degrees 48'W), two localities in the southern Sahelian zone of Mauritania. Adult mosquitoes were collected using indoor pyrethrum spray catch (PSC). Morphological and PCR-based methods were used to identify the species, detect Plasmodium parasites and analyze blood meals in individual mosquitoes. WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed with malathion (5%), bendiocarb (0.1%), permethrin (0.75%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) using female An. gambiae (s.l.) reared from larval and pupal collections from natural breeding sites.
   Results: A total of 2702 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected by PSC during the study period comprising 2291 Anopheles gambiae (s.l.), 376 Anopheles rufipes and 35 Anopheles pharoensis. In Rosso, all mosquitoes from the An. gambiae (s.l.) complex were molecularly identified as An. arabiensis (n = 455/455, 100%). Anopheles pharoensis represented 2.5% (n = 35/1420) of the specimens collected by PSC in Rosso. In Kobeni, An. arabiensis was dominant (n = 278/301, 92.3%) and occurred together with Anopheles coluzzii (n = 18/301, 6%) and An. gambiae (s.s.) (n = 3/301, 1%). Two An. coluzzii x An. arabiensis hybrids were also detected (0.7%) in Kobeni, and An. rufipes was the only other Anopheles species found resting indoors (n = 376/1277, 29.4%). There was an average of 5.6 and 3.6 indoor resting female An. gambiae (s.l.) per room in Kobeni and Rosso, respectively. Indoor resting female An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes in both sites fed most frequently on bovine blood (35.5% in Rosso and 37% in Kobeni). The proportion of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes that took human blood was significantly higher in Kobeni (HBI = 37%) than in Rosso (HBI = 5.6%) and 32% of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes contained blood from more than one host species. None of the 1414 tested mosquitoes in both sites were found positive for Plasmodium spp. sporozoites. WHO insecticide resistance tests revealed resistance to permethrin in the An. arabiensis population from Rosso (mortality = 64%) as well as reduced mortality to deltamethrin (mortality = 97%).
   Conclusion: This study provides updated information on the composition and dynamics of the malaria vector system in southern Mauritania where malaria is endemic. Such data are a necessary prerequisite to devise and implement tailored malaria elimination strategies in areas of low residual transmission.

TI Induction of immunity following vaccination with a chemically attenuated
   malaria vaccine correlates with persistent antigenic stimulation
SO CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB Objectives. Blood stage malaria parasites attenuated with seco-cyclopropyl pyrrolo indole (CPI) analogues induce robust immunity in mice to homologous and heterologous malaria parasites and are being considered for the development of a human vaccine. However, it is not understood how attenuated parasites induce immunity. We showed that following vaccination, parasite DNA persisted in blood for several months, raising the possibility that ongoing immune stimulation may be critical. However, parasites were not seen microscopically beyond 24 h postvaccination. We aimed to provide a mechanistic understanding of immune induction. Methods. Mice were vaccinated with chemically attenuated Plasmodium chabaudi parasites. PCR and adoptive transfer studies were used to determine the presence of parasites and antigen in vivo. In other experiments, Plasmodium falciparum parasitised red blood cells were attenuated in vitro and RNA and antigen expression studied. Results. We show that blood transferred from vaccinated mice into na_ ive mice activates T cells and induces complete protective immunity in the recipient mice strongly suggesting that there is persistence of parasite antigen postvaccination. This is supported by the presence of parasite RNA in vaccinated mice and both RNA and antigen expression in P. falciparum cultures treated with CPI drugs in vitro. In addition, drugs that block parasite growth also prevent the induction of immunity in vaccinated mice, indicating that some growth of attenuated parasites is required for immune induction. Conclusions. Attenuated parasites persist at submicroscopic levels in the blood of mice postvaccination with the ability to activate T cells and induce ongoing protective immune responses.

TI Malaria incidence and prevalence during the first year of life in
   Nanoro, Burkina Faso: a birth-cohort study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Infants are thought to be protected against malaria during the first months of life mainly due to passage of maternal antibodies. However, in high transmission settings, malaria in early infancy is not uncommon and susceptibility to the infections varies between individuals. This study aimed to determine malaria morbidity and infection during early childhood in rural Burkina Faso.
   Methods: Malariometric indices were determined over 1-year follow-up in a birth cohort of 734 infants living in Nanoro health district. Clinical malaria episodes were determined by passive case detection at peripheral health centres while asymptomatic malaria infections were identified during 4 cross-sectional surveys at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Plasmodium falciparum infections were detected by rapid diagnostic test and/or light microscopy (LM) and quantitative PCR (qPCR).
   Results: In total, 717 clinical episodes were diagnosed by qPCR over 8335.18 person-months at risk. The overall malaria incidence was 1.03 per child-year and increased from 0.27 per child-year at 0-3 months of age to 1.92 per child-year at 9-12 months of age. Some 59% of children experienced at least one clinical episode with a median survival time estimated at 9.9 months, while 20% of infants experienced the first episode before 6 months of age. The majority of the clinical episodes were attributable to microscopic parasitaemia (84.2%), and there was a positive correlation between parasite density and age (Spearman's rho = 0.30; P < 0.0001). Prevalence of asymptomatic infections was similar at 3, 6 and 9 months of age (17.7-20.1%) and nearly 1.6 times higher at 12 months (31.3%). Importantly, gametocyte prevalence among the LM-positive study population was 6.7%, but increased to 10% among asymptomatic infections. In addition, 46% of asymptomatic infections were only detected by qPCR suggesting that infants below 1 year are a potential reservoir for sustaining malaria transmission. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections showed marked seasonal distribution with the highest transmission period (July to December) accounting for about 89 and 77% of those infections, respectively.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate high and marked age and seasonal-dependency of malaria infections and disease during the first year of life in Nanoro, calling for intensified efforts to control malaria in rural Burkina Faso.

TI Presence of novel triple mutations in the pvdhfr from Plasmodium vivax
   in Mangaluru city area in the southwestern coastal region of India
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) are the targets of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) present in artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT; artesunate + sulfadoxine pyrimethamine) for Plasmodium falciparum. Although SP is generally not used to treat vivax infection, mutations in dhfr and dhps that confer antifolate resistance in Plasmodium vivax are common; which may be attributed to its sympatric existence with P. falciparum. Current study was aimed to determine the pattern of mutations in dhfr and dhps in P. vivax isolates from Mangaluru region.
   Methods: A total of 140 blood samples were collected from P. vivax-infected people attending Wenlock Hospital Mangaluru during July 2014 to January 2016. Out of 140 isolates, 25 (18%) and 50 (36%) isolates were selected randomly for sequence analysis of pvdhfr and pvdhps genes respectively. Fragment of pvdhps and full length pvdhfr were amplified, sequenced and analysed for single nucleotide polymorphisms. dhps was analysed by PCR-RFLP also, to detect the two specific mutations (A383G and A553G).
   Results: Analysis of pvdhps sequences from 50 isolates revealed single and double mutants at 38 and 46% respectively. Three non-synonymous mutations (K55R, S58R and S117N) were identified for pvdhfr. Among these, K55R was detected for the first time.
   Conclusions: The current study indicates that P. vivax dhps and dhfr mutant alleles are prevalent in this area, suggesting significant SP pressure.

TI Molecular approaches to determine the multiplicity of Plasmodium
   infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Multiplicity of infection (MOI), also termed complexity of infection (COI), is defined as the number of genetically distinct parasite strains co-infecting a single host, which is an important indicator of malaria epidemiology. PCR-based genotyping often underestimates MOI. Next generation sequencing technologies provide much more accurate and genome-wide characterization of polyclonal infections. However, complete haplotype characterization of multiclonal infections remains a challenge due to PCR artifacts and sequencing errors, and requires efficient computational tools. In this review, the advantages and limitations of current molecular approaches to determine multiplicity of malaria parasite infection are discussed.

TI Ebolavirus diagnosis made simple, comparable and faster than molecular
   detection methods: preparing for the future
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: The 2014/2015 Ebolavirus outbreak resulted in more than 28,000 cases and 11,323 reported deaths, as of March 2016. Domestic transmission of the Guinea strain associated with the outbreak occurred mainly in six African countries, and international transmission was reported in four countries. Outbreak management was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was comparable with real-time TaqMan (TM) PCR.
   Methods: Designed, screened, selected and optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial dilutions (1.34 x 10(10-) 1.34 x 10(1) copies/mu L) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured Ebolavirus as established by realtime TaqMan (TM) PCR that was performed using ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains - Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further tested for Dengue virus 1-4, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin strain).
   Results: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per mu L of plasmid containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated from clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Our assay could be suitable for implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating block and centrifuge is required for operation. The technique could provide a pathway for rapid screening of patients and animals for improved management of outbreaks.

TI A novel field-based molecular assay to detect validated
   artemisinin-resistant k13 mutants
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Given the risk of artemisinin resistance spreading from the Greater Mekong sub-region, prospective monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa should be expedited. Molecular biology techniques used for monitoring rely on the detection of k13 validated mutants by using PCR and Sanger sequencing approach, usually not available in malaria endemic areas.
   Methods: A semi-automated workflow based on the easyMAG (R) platform and the Argene-Solution (R) (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) as a field-based surveillance tool operable at national level was developed in four steps. Clinical and analytical performances of this tool detecting five of the most frequent and validated k13 mutants (Y493H, I543T, R539T, F446I and C580Y) from dried blood spots (DBS) were compared to the gold standard approach (PCR and Sanger sequencing).
   Results: By using the ARMS (amplification-refractory mutation system) strategy, the best multiplexing options were found in 3 separate real-time PCR duplexes (IC as internal control/I543T, C580Y/Y493H and F446I/R539T) with limits of detection ranging from 50 (C580Y) to 6.25 parasites/mu L (Y493H). In field conditions, using 642 clinical DBS (from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic individuals) collected from Cambodia, Myanmar and Africa (Chad), the overall sensitivity and specificity of the K13 bMx prototype assay developed by bioMerieux were >= 90%. Areas under the ROC curves were estimated to be > 0.90 for all k13 mutants in samples from symptomatic patients.
   Conclusion: The K13 ready-to-use bMx prototype assay, considered by the end-users as a user-friendly assay to perform (in shorter time than the K13 reference assay) and easy to interpret, was found to require less budget planning and had fewer logistical constraints. Its excellent performance qualifies the prototype as a reliable screening tool usable in malaria endemic countries recognized to be at risk of emergence or spread of validated k13 mutants. Additional multi-site studies are needed to evaluate the performances of the K13 bMx prototype assay in different epidemiological contexts such as Africa, India, or South America.

TI Analysis of Theileria orientalis draft genome sequences reveals
   potential species-level divergence of the Ikeda, Chitose and Buffeli
   genotypes
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Theileria orientalis (Apicomplexa: Piroplasmida) has caused clinical disease in cattle of Eastern Asia for many years and its recent rapid spread throughout Australian and New Zealand herds has caused substantial economic losses to production through cattle deaths, late term abortion and morbidity. Disease outbreaks have been linked to the detection of a pathogenic genotype of T. orientalis, genotype Ikeda, which is also responsible for disease outbreaks in Asia. Here, we sequenced and compared the draft genomes of one pathogenic (Ikeda) and two apathogenic (Chitose, Buffeli) isolates of T. orientalis sourced from Australian herds.
   Results: Using de novo assembled sequences and a single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis pipeline, we found extensive genetic divergence between the T. orientalis genotypes. A genome-wide phylogeny reconstructed to address continued confusion over nomenclature of this species displayed concordance with prior phylogenetic studies based on the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene. However, average nucleotide identity (ANI) values revealed that the divergence between isolates is comparable to that observed between other theilerias which represent distinct species. Analysis of SNVs revealed putative recombination between the Chitose and Buffeli genotypes and also between Australian and Japanese Ikeda isolates. Finally, to inform future vaccine studies, dN/ dS ratios and surface location predictions were analysed. Six predicted surface protein targets were confirmed to be expressed during the piroplasm phase of the parasite by mass spectrometry.
   Conclusions: We used whole genome sequencing to demonstrate that the T. orientalis Ikeda, Chitose and Buffeli variants show substantial genetic divergence. Our data indicates that future researchers could potentially consider disease-associated Ikeda and closely related genotypes as a separate species from non-pathogenic Chitose and Buffeli.

TI Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax recent
   exposure in an area of significantly decreased transmission intensity in
   Central Vietnam
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In Vietnam, malaria transmission has been reduced to very low levels over the past 20 years, and as a consequence, the country aims to eliminate malaria by 2030. This study aimed to characterize the dynamics and extent of the parasite reservoir in Central Vietnam, in order to further target elimination strategies and surveillance.
   Methods: A 1-year prospective cohort study (n = 429) was performed in three rural communities in Quang Nam province. Six malaria screenings were conducted between November 2014 and November 2015, including systematic clinical examination and blood sampling for malaria parasite identification, as well as molecular and serological analysis of the study population. Malaria infections were detected by light microscopy (LM) and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), while exposure to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was measured in the first and last survey by ELISA for PfAMA1, PfGLURP R2, PvAMA1, and PvMSP1-19. Classification and regression trees were used to define seropositivity and recent exposure.
   Results: Four malaria infections (2 P. falciparum, 2 P. vivax) were detected in the same village by qPCR and/or LM. No fever cases were attributable to malaria. At the same time, the commune health centre (serving a larger area) reported few cases of confirmed malaria cases. Nevertheless, serological data proved that 13.5% of the surveyed population was exposed to P. falciparum and/or P. vivax parasites during the study period, of which 32.6% were seronegative at the start of the study, indicating ongoing transmission in the area. Risk factor analysis for seroprevalence and exposure to P. falciparum and/or P. vivax identified structural or economic risk factors and activity/behaviour-related factors, as well as spatial heterogeneity at the village level.
   Conclusions: Previous studies in Central Vietnam demonstrated high occurrence of asymptomatic and sub-microscopic infections. However, in this study very few asymptomatic infections were detected despite serological evidence of continued transmission. Nonetheless, the factors associated with spatial heterogeneity in transmission could be evaluated using serological classification of recent exposure, which supports the usefulness of serological methods to monitor malaria transmission.

TI Malaria control in a tribal area of central India using existing tools
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Malaria is difficult to control in central India because of geographical terrain, efficient vectors, and perennial transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and socio-cultural practices of ethnic tribes. The objective was to develop a model to prevent and control malaria in hard to reach areas using existing tools. Baigachak (Tribe population 31,900) situated in Dindori district was undertaken for this study. Intervention measures used are indoor residual spray (IRS), long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs), prompt diagnosis and treatment along with intensive Information, Education and Communication (IEC) involving school children as agent of change. Door to door rapid fever surveys were carried out in the study area from 2009 to 14 and finger prick blood smears were made from all fever cases and examined under microscope. Mosquitoes were assayed for the presence of sporozoites by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique and sibling species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are two highly efficient vectors i.e. Anopheles culicifacies and An. fluviatilis. In monsoon season of 2009, the man hour density for An. culicifacies was 36.2 which declined to 10.9 during monsoon season of 2010-14 (t = 6.52; p < 0.0001). Epidemiological results revealed that malaria positivity was declined from 27% in 2009-3% in 2014 (Trend chi(2) = 57.21; p < 0.0001) and P. falciparum declined from 23.6 to 2.4% (Trend chi(2) = 48.33; p < 0.0001). Spleen rate was declined from 47% in 2009-5% in 2014 (chi(2) for trend = 6.1; p = 0.0135). Baigachak has achieved a remarkable 89% reduction in malaria. This study confirms that the control strategies undertaken in this study are useful and should be extended at multiple sites for further validation.

TI Role of rs4986790 Polymorphism of TLR4 Gene in Susceptibility towards
   Malaria Infection in the Pakistani Population
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the human immune mechanism play important role in the detection of invading pathogens. TLRs specifically recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from pathogens and start the effective response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLRs can mediate their functions. Present study evaluated the importance of rs4986790 polymorphism of TLR4 gene in susceptibility towards malaria, clinical outcomes of the disease and responsible species of malaria.
   Methods: Blood samples of 228 malaria patients and 226 healthy volunteers were selected for the study. Sample collection was completed during Sep 2013 to Sep 2015 from different hospitals of Punjab, Pakistan. Patient's samples were divided into P. vivax group and P. falciparum group on the basis of causative species of Plasmodium. Malaria samples were also divided into mild and severe malaria group based on clinical outcomes of the disease according to WHO criteria. Healthy individuals were placed in the control group. Whole blood was used for the isolation of DNA. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplification of targeted SNP was performed using allele-specific PCR.
   Results: Results indicate the protective role of AA genotype against the susceptibility of P. vivax infection, OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.285-0.876, P=0.038.
   Conclusion: rs4986790 polymorphism of TLR4 gene modulates the susceptibility towards P. vivax infection. AA genotype is found to be protective against the development of P. vivax infection in the local population of Pakistan.

TI Plasmodium Gametocytes in Field Studies: Do We Measure Commitment to
   Transmission or Detectability?
SO TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
AB The proportion of Plasmodium spp. infections carrying gametocytes, and gametocyte densities, are often reported as surrogate markers for transmission potential. It remains unclear whether parasites under natural conditions adjust commitment to transmission depending on external factors. Population-based surveys comprising mostly asymptomatic low-density infections are always impacted by the sensitivity of the assays used to diagnose infections and detect gametocytes. Asexual parasite density is an important predictor for the probability of detecting gametocytes, and in many cases it can explain patterns in gametocyte carriage without the need for an adjustment of the gametocyte conversion rate. When reporting gametocyte data, quantification of blood-stage parasitemia and its inclusion as a confounder in multivariable analyses is essential.

TI Bone Marrow Is a Major Parasite Reservoir in Plasmodium vivax Infection
SO MBIO
AB Plasmodium vivax causes heavy burdens of disease across malarious regions worldwide. Mature P. vivax asexual and transmissive gametocyte stages occur in the blood circulation, and it is often assumed that accumulation/sequestration in tissues is not an important phase in their development. Here, we present a systematic study of P. vivax stage distributions in infected tissues of nonhuman primate (NHP) malaria models as well as in blood from human infections. In a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage parasites, we found a conserved cascade of stage-specific gene expression despite the greatly different gametocyte maturity times of these two species. Using this knowledge, we validated a set of conserved asexual-and gametocyte-stage markers both by quantitative real-time PCR and by antibody assays of peripheral blood samples from infected patients and NHP (Aotus sp.). Histological analyses of P. vivax parasites in organs of 13 infected NHP (Aotus and Saimiri species) demonstrated a major fraction of immature gametocytes in the parenchyma of the bone marrow, while asexual schizont forms were enriched to a somewhat lesser extent in this region of the bone marrow as well as in sinusoids of the liver. These findings suggest that the bone marrow is an important reservoir for gametocyte development and proliferation of malaria parasites.
   IMPORTANCE Plasmodium vivax malaria continues to cause major public health burdens worldwide. Yet, significant knowledge gaps in the basic biology and epidemiology of P. vivax malaria remain, largely due to limited available tools for research and diagnostics. Here, we present a systematic examination of tissue sequestration during P. vivax infection. Studies of nonhuman primates and malaria patients revealed enrichment of developing sexual stages (gametocytes) and mature replicative stages (schizonts) in the bone marrow and liver, relative to those present in peripheral blood. Identification of the bone marrow as a major P. vivax tissue reservoir has important implications for parasite diagnosis and treatment.

TI iNOS polymorphism modulates iNOS/NO expression via impaired antioxidant
   and ROS content in P. vivax and P. falciparum infection
SO REDOX BIOLOGY
AB Nitric oxide (NO) has dicotomic influence on modulating host-parasite interplay, synchronizing physiological orchestrations and diagnostic potential; instigated us to investigate the plausible association and genetic regulation among NO level, components of oxidative stress, iNOS polymorphisms and risk of malaria. Here, we experimentally elucidate that iNOS promoter polymorphisms are associated with risk of malaria; employing mutation specific genotyping, functional interplay using western blot and RT-PCR, quantitative estimation of NO, total antioxidant content (TAC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   Genotyping revealed significantly associated risk of P. vivax (adjusted OR = 1.92 and 1.72) and P. falciparum (adjusted OR = 1.68 and 1.75) infection with SNP at iNOS-954G/C and iNOS-1173C/T positions, respectively; though vivax showed higher risk of infection. Intriguingly, mutation and infection specific differential upregulation of iNOS expression/NO level was observed and found to be significantly associated with mutant genotypes. Moreover, P. vivax showed pronounced iNOS protein (2.4 fold) and mRNA (2.5 fold) expression relative to healthy subjects. Furthermore, TAC and ROS were significantly decreased in infection; and differentially decreased in mutant genotypes.
   Our findings endorse polymorphic regulation of iNOS expression, altered oxidant-antioxidant components and evidences of risk association as the hallmark of malaria pathogenesis. iNOS/NO may serve as potential diagnostic marker in assessing clinical malaria.

TI Microdam Impoundments Provide Suitable Habitat for Larvae of Malaria
   Vectors: An Observational Study in Western Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB Impoundments formed by microdams in rural areas of Africa are important sources of water for people, but they provide potential larval habitats for Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes that are vectors of malaria. To study this association, the perimeters of 31 microdam impoundments in western Kenya were sampled for Anopheles larvae in three zones (patches of floating and emergent vegetation, shorelines of open water, and aggregations of cattle hoofprints) across dry and rainy seasons. Of 3,169 larvae collected, most (86.8%) were collected in the rainy season. Of 2,403 larvae successfully reared to fourth instar or adult, nine species were identified; most (80.2%) were Anopheles arabiensis Patton, sampled from hoofprint zones in the rainy season. Other species collected were Anopheles coustani Laveran, Anopheles gambiae s. s. Giles, Anopheles funestus Giles, and Anopheles rivulorum Leeson, Anopheles pharoensis Theobald, Anopheles squamosus Theobald, Anopheles rufipes (Gough), and Anopheles ardensis (Theobald). Larvae of An. funestus were uncommon (1.5%) in both dry and rainy seasons and were confined to vegetated zones, suggesting that microdam impoundments are not primary habitats for this important vector species, although microdams may provide a dry season refuge habitat for malaria vectors, contributing to population persistence through the dry season. In this study, microdam impoundments clearly provided habitat for the malaria vector An. arabiensis in the rainy season, most of which was within the shallow apron side of the impoundments where people brought cattle for watering, resulting in compacted soil with aggregations of water-filled hoofprints. This observation suggests a potential conflict between public health concerns about malaria and people's need for stable and reliable sources of water.

TI The persistence and oscillations of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum
   and Plasmodium vivax infections over time in Vietnam: an open cohort
   study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background A substantial proportion of Plasmodium species infections are asymptomatic with densities too low to be detectable with standard diagnostic techniques. The importance of such asymptomatic plasmodium infections in malaria transmission is probably related to their duration and density. To explore the duration of asymptomatic plasmodium infections and changes in parasite densities over time, a cohort of participants who were infected with Plasmodium parasites was observed over a 2-year follow-up period.
   Methods In this open cohort study, inhabitants of four villages in Vietnam were invited to participate in baseline and subsequent 3-monthly surveys up to 24 months, which included the collection of venous blood samples. Samples were batch-screened using ultra-sensitive (u)PCR (lower limit of detection of 22 parasites per mL). Participants found to be infected by uPCR during any of these surveys were invited to join a prospective cohort and provide monthly blood samples. We estimated the persistence of Plasmodium fakiparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and changes in parasite densities over a study period of 24 months.
   Findings Between Dec 1, 2013, and Jan 8, 2016, 356 villagers participated in between one and 22 surveys. These study participants underwent 4248 uPCR evaluations (11.9 tests per participant). 1874 (32%) of 4248 uPCR tests indicated a plasmodium infection; 679 (36%) of 1874 tests were P falciparum monoinfections, 507 (27%) were P vivax monoinfections, 463 (25%) were co-infections with P falciparum and P vivax, and 225 (12%) were indeterminate species of Plasmodium. The median duration of P falciparum infection was 2 months (IQR 1-3); after accounting for censoring, participants had a 20% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The median duration of P vivax infection was 6 months (3-9), and participants had a 59% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The parasite densities of persistent infections oscillated; following ultralow-density infections, high-density infections developed frequently.
   Interpretation Persistent largely asymptomatic P vivax and P falciparum infections are common in this area of low seasonal malaria transmission. Infections with low-density parasitaemias can develop into much higher density infections at a later time, which are likely to sustain malaria endemicity.

TI Role of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha cytokines and TNF-alpha promoter
   variability in Plasmodium vivax infection during pregnancy in endemic
   population of Jharkhand, India
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: The combinatorial effects of Plasmodium infection, perturbation of inflammatory responses and the dichotomic role of TNF promoter polymorphism has potential clinical and physiological relevance during pregnancy.
   Objective and Methods: This coordinated orchestration instigated us to investigate the circulating level of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6) employing ELISA in a stratified group of samples and the plausible genetic association of TNF-alpha - 308 G/A using PCR-RFLP/sequencing during Plasmodium vivax infection in pregnancy.
   Results: We observed significantly elevated concentrations of IL-1 beta were observed, followed by IL-6 and TNF-alpha in women with malaria (WWM) and in malaria in pregnancy (MIP). Further, elevated IL-beta, followed by TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected in the non-infected pregnancy group. The differential dynamics of inflammatory cytokine concentration during each trimester of pregnancy with and without P. vivax infection were detected. For the first time, a high level of IL-6 was observed in the first trimester of MIP and high IL-beta in healthy pregnancies. In the second trimester, however, we observed a high level of IL-1 beta in the MIP group compared to a sustained high level of IL-1 beta in the healthy pregnancy group. In the third trimester, high was sustained in the MIP group and healthy pregnancies acquired a high TNF-alpha level. The genotypic distribution for the TNF-alpha promoter - 308 G/A position was observed to be nonsignificant and mildly associated during MIP (OR = 1.4) and in WWM (OR = 1.2). Moreover, based on genotypic distribution, we observed a well-correlated and significantly elevated TNF-alpha concentration in the mutant homozygote genotype (AA; p = 0.001) followed by heterozygotes (GA; p = 0.0001) and ancestral genotypes (GG; p = 0.0001) in both MIP and WWM subjects.
   Conclusion: The observation of elevated IL-1 beta and IL-6 in MIP and TNF-a in WWM may be regarded as a prognostic inflammatory marker of infection and pregnancy. Most particularly, the TNF-alpha concentration and its polymorphic variability in the promoter region may indicate genetic susceptibility and mildly influence the risk for P. vivax infection during pregnancy and in women with malaria.

TI Towards development of aptamers that specifically bind to lactate
   dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum through epitopic targeting
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Early detection is crucial for the effective treatment of malaria, particularly in those cases infected with Plasmodium falciparum. There is a need for diagnostic devices with the capacity to distinguish P. falciparum from other strains of malaria. Here, aptamers generated against targeted species-specific epitopes of P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (rPfLDH) are described.
   Results: Two classes of aptamers bearing high binding affinity and specificity for recombinant P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (rPfLDH) and P. falciparum-specific lactate dehydrogenase epitopic oligopeptide (LDHp) were separately generated. Structurally-relevant moieties with particular consensus sequences (GGTAG and GGCG) were found in aptamers reported here and previously published, confirming their importance in recognition of the target, while novel moieties particular to this work (ATTAT and poly-A stretches) were identified. Aptamers with diagnostically-supportive functions were synthesized, prime examples of which are the aptamers designated as LDHp 1, LDHp 11 and rLDH 4 and rLDH 15 in work presented herein. Of the sampled aptamers raised against the recombinant protein, rLDH 4 showed the highest binding to the target rPfLDH in the ELONA assay, with both rLDH 4 and rLDH 15 indicating an ability to discriminate between rPfLDH and rPvLDH. LDHp 11 was generated against a peptide selected as a unique P. falciparum LDH peptide. The aptamer, LDHp 11, like antibodies against the same peptide, only detected rPfLDH and discriminated between rPfLDH and rPvLDH.This was supported by affinity binding experiments where only aptamers generated against a unique species-specific epitope showed an ability to preferentially bind to rPfLDH relative to rPvLDH rather than those generated against the whole recombinant protein. In addition, rLDH 4 and LDHp 11 demonstrated in situ binding to P. falciparum cells during confocal microscopy.
   Conclusions: The utilization and application of LDHp 11, an aptamer generated against a unique species-specific epitope of P. falciparum LDH indicated the ability to discriminate between recombinant P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax LDH. This aptamer holds promise as a biorecognition element in malaria diagnostic devices for the detection, and differentiation, of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections. This study paves the way to explore aptamer generation against targeted species-specific epitopes of other Plasmodium species.

TI Infection of Anopheles aquasalis from symptomatic and asymptomatic
   Plasmodium vivax infections in Manaus, western Brazilian Amazon
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Asymptomatic individuals are one of the major challenges for malaria elimination programs in endemic areas. In the absence of clinical symptoms and with a lower parasite density they constitute silent reservoirs considered important for maintaining transmission of human malaria. Studies from Brazil have shown that infected individuals may carry these parasites for long periods.
   Results: Patients were selected from three periurban endemic areas of the city of Manaus, in the western Brazilian Amazon. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with positive thick blood smear and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) positive for Plasmodium vivax were invited to participate in the study. A standardised pvs25 gene amplification by qPCR was used for P. vivax gametocytes detection. Anopheles aquasalis were fed using membrane feeding assays (MFA) containing blood from malaria patients. Parasitemia of 42 symptomatic and 25 asymptomatic individuals was determined by microscopic examination of blood smears and qPCR. Parasitemia density and gametocyte density were assessed as determinants of infection rates and oocysts densities. A strong correlation between gametocyte densities (microscopy and molecular techniques) and mosquito infectivity (P < 0.001) and oocysts median numbers (P < 0.05) was found in both groups. The ability to infect mosquitoes was higher in the symptomatic group (41%), but infectivity in the asymptomatic group was also seen (1.42%).
   Conclusions: Although their infectivity to mosquitoes is relatively low, given the high prevalence of P. vivax asymptomatic carriers they are likely to play and important role in malaria transmission in the city of Manaus. The role of asymptomatic infections therefore needs to be considered in future malaria elimination programs in Brazil.

TI High production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by maternal blood
   mononuclear cells is associated with reduced maternal malaria but
   increased cord blood infection
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Increased susceptibility to malaria during pregnancy is not completely understood. Cellular immune responses mediate both pathology and immunity but the effector responses involved in these processes have not been fully characterized. Maternal and fetal cytokine and chemokine responses to malaria at delivery, and their association with pregnancy and childhood outcomes, were investigated in 174 samples from a mother and child cohort from Mozambique. Peripheral and cord mononuclear cells were stimulated with Plasmodium falciparum lysate and secretion of IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IL-4, IL-5, IL-1 beta, INF, TNF-beta was quantified in culture supernatants by multiplex flow cytometry while cellular mRNA expression of IFN-gamma,TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 was measured by quantitative PCR.
   Results: Higher concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 beta were associated with a reduced risk of P. falciparum infection in pregnant women (p < 0.049). Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF strongly correlated among themselves (p > 0.5, p < 0.001). Higher production of IL-1 beta was significantly associated with congenital malaria (p < 0.046) and excessive TNF was associated with peripheral infection and placental lesions (p < 0.044).
   Conclusions: Complex network of immuno-pathological cytokine mechanisms in the placental and utero environments showed a potential trade-off between positive and negative effects on mother and newborn susceptibility to infection.

TI Differential plasma microvesicle and brain profiles of microRNA in
   experimental cerebral malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a fatal complication of Plasmodium infection, mostly affecting children under the age of five in the sub-Saharan African region. CM pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, although sequestered infected red blood cells, inflammatory cells aggregating in the cerebral blood vessels, and the microvesicies (MV) that they release in the circulation, have been implicated. Plasma MV numbers increase in CM patients and in the murine model, where blocking their release, genetically or pharmacologically, protects against brain pathology, suggesting a role of MV in CM neuropathogenesis. In this work, the microRNA (miRNA) cargo of MV is defined for the first time during experimental CM with the overarching hypothesis that this characterization could help understand CM pathogenesis.
   Results: The change in abundance of miRNA was studied following infection of CBA mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain (causing experimental CM), and Plasmodium yoelii, which causes severe malaria without cerebral complications, termed non-CM (NCM). miRNA expression was analyzed using microarrays to compare MV from healthy (NI) and CM mice, yielding several miRNA of interest. The differential expression profiles of these selected miRNA (miR146a, miR-150, miR-193b, miR-205, miR-215, miR-467a, and miR-486) were analyzed in mouse MV, MV-free plasma, and brain tissue by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).Two miRNA-miR-146a and miR-193b-were confirmed as differentially abundant in MV from CM mice, compared with NCM and NI mice. These miRNA have been shown to play various roles in inflammation, and their dysregulation during CM may be critical for triggering the neurological syndrome via regulation of their potential downstream targets.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that, in the mouse model at least, miRNA may have a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.

TI Uneven malaria transmission in geographically distinct districts of
   Bobo- Dioulasso, Burkina Faso
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Urbanization is a main trend in developing countries and leads to health transition. Although non-communicable diseases are increasing in cities of low-income countries, vector-borne diseases such as malaria, are still present. In the case of malaria, transmission is lower than in rural areas, but is uneven and not well documented. In this study, we wanted to evaluate intra-urban malaria transmission in a West African country (Burkina Faso).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study on 847 adults (35 to 59 year-old) and 881 children (6 months to 5 year-old) living in 1045 households of four districts (Dogona, Yeguere, Tounouma and Secteur 25) of Bobo-Dioulasso was performed between October and November 2013. The districts were selected according to a geographical approach that took into account the city heterogeneity. Malaria prevalence was evaluated using thick and thin blood smears. Human exposure to Anopheles bites was measured by assessing the level of IgG against the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide. Adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC traps and indoor insecticide spraying in some houses of the four neighbourhoods. The Anopheles species and Plasmodium falciparum infection rate were determined using PCR assays.
   Results: In this study, 98.5% of the malaria infections were due to Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria transmission occurred in the four districts. Malaria prevalence was higher in children than in adults (19.2 vs 4.4%), and higher in the central districts than in the peripheral ones (P = 0.001). The median IgG level was more elevated in P. falciparuminfected than in non-infected individuals (P < 0.001). Anopheles arabiensis was the main vector identified (83.2%; 227 of the 273 tested mosquito specimens). Five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes were caught and they were all caught in the central district of Tounouma where 28.6% (14/49) of the tested blood-fed mosquito specimens had a human blood meal.
   Conclusions: This study showed that urban malaria transmission occurred in Bobo-Dioulasso, in all the four studied areas, but mainly in central districts. Environmental determinants primarily explain this situation, which calls for better urban management.

TI Effect of generalised access to early diagnosis and treatment and
   targeted mass drug administration on Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
   Eastern Myanmar: an observational study of a regional elimination
   programme
SO LANCET
AB Background Potentially untreatable Plasmodium falciparum malaria threatens the Greater Mekong subregion. A previous series of pilot projects in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam suggested that mass drug administration was safe, and when added to provision of early diagnosis and treatment, could reduce the reservoir of P falciparum and interrupts transmission. We examined the effects of a scaled-up programme of this strategy in four townships of eastern Myanmar on the incidence of P falciparum malaria.
   Methods The programme was implemented in the four townships of Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun in Kayin state, Myanmar. Increased access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria was provided to all villages through community-based malaria posts equipped with rapid diagnostic tests, and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine plus single low-dose primaquine. Villages were identified as malarial hotspots (operationally defined as > 40% malaria, of which 20% was P falciparum) with surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR either randomly or targeted at villages where the incidence of clinical cases of P falciparum malaria remained high (ie, > 100 cases per 1000 individuals per year) despite a functioning malaria post. During each survey, a 2 mL sample of venous blood was obtained from randomly selected adults. Hotspots received targeted mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus single-dose primaquine once per month for 3 consecutive months in addition to the malaria posts. The main outcome was the change in village incidence of clinical P falciparum malaria, quantified using a multivariate, generalised, additive multilevel model. Malaria prevalence was measured in the hotspots 12 months after mass drug administration.
   Findings Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2017, 1222 malarial posts were opened, providing early diagnosis and treatment to an estimated 365 000 individuals. Incidence of P falciparum malaria decreased by 60 to 98% in the four townships. 272 prevalence surveys were undertaken and 69 hotspot villages were identified. By April 2017, 50 hotspots were treated with mass drug administration. Hotspot villages had a three times higher incidence of P falciparum at malarial posts than neighbouring villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.8-4.4). Early diagnosis and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in P falciparum incidence in hotspots (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88 per quarter) and in other villages (0.75, 0.73-0.78 per quarter). Mass drug administration was associated with a five-times decrease in P falciparum incidence within hotspot villages (IRR 0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.26). By April, 2017, 965 villages (79%) of 1222 corresponding to 104 village tracts were free from P falciparum malaria for at least 6 months. The prevalence of wild-type genotype for K13 molecular markers of artemisinin resistance was stable over the three years (39%; 249/631).
   Interpretation Providing early diagnosis and effective treatment substantially decreased village-level incidence of artemisinin-resistant P falciparum malaria in hard-to-reach, politically sensitive regions of eastern Myanmar. Targeted mass drug administration significantly reduced malaria incidence in hotspots. If these activities could proceed in all contiguous endemic areas in addition to standard control programmes already implemented, there is a possibility of subnational elimination of P falciparum.

TI Evaluating seroprevalence to circumsporozoite protein to estimate
   exposure to three species of Plasmodium in the Brazilian Amazon
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background: Brazil has seen a great decline in malaria and the country is moving towards elimination. However, for eventual elimination, the control program needs efficient tools in order to monitor malaria exposure and transmission. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether seroprevalence to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a good tool for monitoring the exposure to and/or evaluating the burden and distribution of Plasmodium species in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in a rural area of Porto Velho, Rondonia state. Parasite infection was detected by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies to the sporozoite CSP repeats of Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae (PvCS, PfCS, and PmCS) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and DQB1 genes were typed using Luminex (R) xMAP (R) technology.
   Results: The prevalence of immunoglobulin G against P. vivax CSP peptide (62%) was higher than P. falciparum (49%) and P. malariae (46%) CSP peptide. Most of the studied individuals had antibodies to at least one of the three peptides (72%), 34% had antibodies to all three peptides and 28% were non-responders. Although the majority of the population was not infected at the time of the survey, 74.3% of parasite-negative individuals had antibodies to at least one of the CSPs. Importantly, among individuals carrying the haplotypes DRB1*04D similar to QB1*03, there was a significantly higher frequency of PfCS responders, and DRB1*16 similar to DQB1*03 haplotype for PvCS and PfCS responders. In contrast, HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DQB1*05 allelic groups were associated with a lack of antibodies to P. vivax and P. falciparum CSP repeats, and the haplotype DRB1*01 similar to DQB1*05 was also associated with non-responders, including non-responders to P. malariae.
   Conclusions: Our results show that in low transmission settings, naturally acquired antibody responses against the CSP repeats of P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae in a single cross-sectional study may not represent a valuable marker for monitoring recent malaria exposure, especially in an area with a high prevalence of P. vivax. Furthermore, HLA class II molecules play an important role in antibody response and require further study with a larger sample size. It will be of interest to consider HLA analysis when using serosurveillance to monitor malaria exposure among genetically diverse populations.

TI Contribution to Malaria Transmission of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic
   Parasite Carriers in Cambodia
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Eliminating falciparum malaria in Cambodia is a top priority, requiring the implementation of novel tools and strategies to interrupt its transmission. To date, few data are available regarding the contributions to malaria transmission of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.
   Methods. Direct-membrane and skin feeding assays (DMFAs, SFAS) were performed, using Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus, to determine infectivity of symptomatic falciparum-infected patients and malaria asymptomatic carriers; a subset of the latter were followed up for 2 months to assess their transmission potential.
   Results. By microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction, Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte prevalence rates were, respectively, 19.3% (n = 21/109) and 44% (n = 47/109) on day (D) 0 and 17.9% (n = 5/28) and 89.3% (n = 25/28) in recrudescent patients (Drec) (RT-PCR Drec vs DO P = .002). Falciparum malaria patient infectivity was low on DO (6.2%; n = 3/48) and in Drec (8.3%; n = 1/12). Direct-membrane feeding assays and SFAs gave similar results. None of the falciparum (n = 0/19) and 3 of 28 Plasmodium vivax asymptomatic carriers were infectious to mosquitoes, including those that were followed up for 2 months. Overall, P falciparum gametocytemias were low except in a few symptomatic carriers
   Conclusions. Only symptomatic falciparum malaria patients were infectious to mosquito vectors at baseline and recrudescence, highlighting the need to detect promptly and treat effectively P. falciparum patients.

TI Detection of malaria sporozoites expelled during mosquito sugar feeding
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria is a severe disease of global importance transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. The ability to rapidly detect the presence of infectious mosquitoes able to transmit malaria is of vital importance for surveillance, control and elimination efforts. Current methods principally rely on large-scale mosquito collections followed by labour-intensive salivary gland dissections or enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) methods to detect sporozoites. Using forced salivation, we demonstrate here that Anopheles mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium expel sporozoites during sugar feeding. Expelled sporozoites can be detected on two sugar-soaked substrates, cotton wool and Whatman FTA cards, and sporozoite DNA is detectable using real-time PCR. These results demonstrate a simple and rapid methodology for detecting the presence of infectious mosquitoes with sporozoites and highlight potential laboratory applications for investigating mosquito-malaria interactions. Our results indicate that FTA cards could be used as a simple, effective and economical tool in enhancing field surveillance activities for malaria.

TI Detection of Anopheles rivulorum-like, a member of the Anopheles
   funestus group, in South Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and Anopheles funestus s.l. species complexes contain the most important malaria vectors in Africa. Within the An. funestus group of at least 11 African species, the vector status of all but the nominal species An. funestus appears poorly investigated, although evidence exists that Anopheles rivulorum and Anopheles vaneedeni may play minor roles. A new species, An. rivulorum-like, was described from Burkina Faso in 2000 and subsequently also found in Cameroon and Zambia. This is the first paper reporting the presence of this species in South Africa, thereby significantly extending its known range.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected using dry-ice baited net traps and CDC light traps in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Sixty-four An. funestus s.l. among an overall 844 mosquitoes were captured and identified to species level using the polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were also analysed for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein using the enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay.
   Results: Four members of the An. funestus group were identified: An. rivulorum-like (n = 49), An. rivulorum (n = 11), Anopheles parensis (n = 2) and Anopheles leesoni (n = 1). One mosquito could not be identified. No evidence of P. falciparum was detected in any of the specimens.
   Conclusion: This is the first report of An. rivulorum-like south of Zambia, and essentially extends the range of this species from West Africa down to South Africa. Given the continental-scale drive towards malaria elimination and the challenges faced by countries in the elimination phase to understand and resolve residual transmission, efforts should be directed towards determining the largely unknown malaria vector potential of members of the An. funestus group and other potential secondary vectors.

TI Closing in on the Reservoir: Proactive Case Detection in High-Risk
   Groups as a Strategy to Detect Plasmodium falciparum Asymptomatic
   Carriers in Cambodia
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. In the frame of elimination strategies of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), active case detection has been recommended as complementary approach to the existing passive case detection programs. We trialed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based active detection strategy targeting asymptomatic individuals, named proactive case detection (PACD), with the aim of assessing its feasibility, the extra yield of Pf infections, and the at-risk population for Pf carriage status.
   Methods. A pilot of PACD was conducted in 3 villages in Chey Saen district (Preah Vihear province, Cambodia), from December 2015 to March 2016. Voluntary screening and treatment, following health promotion sensitization, was used as mobilization strategy.
   Results. A total of 2802 persons were tested, representing 54% of the population. PACD (n = 30) and the respective reactive case detection (RACD) (n = 3) identified 33 Pf carriers, approximately twice as many as the Pf infections (n = 17) diagnosed in passive case detection and respective RACD, by health centers and village malaria workers using PCR, in the same villages/period. Final positivity rate was 1.07% (30/2802). People spending nighttime in forests and plantations were found to be at increased risk for Pf infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.2], P = .002 and OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.1-4.9], P = .03, respectively).
   Conclusions. We demonstrated the usefulness of the PACD component in identifying Pf asymptomatic carriers. Social mobilization and promotion led to good attendance of specific risk groups, identified to be, in the Cambodian context, individuals spending nighttime in forest and plantations.

TI Pyronaridine-artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kenyan children: a
   randomized controlled non-inferiority trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Pyronaridine-artesunate is a novel artemisinin-based combination therapy. The efficacy and safety of pyronaridine-artesunate were compared with artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children.
   Methods: This phase III open-label randomized controlled non-inferiority trial was conducted in Western Kenya. Children aged 6 months to <= 12 years with a bodyweight > 5 kg and microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to orally receive pyronaridine-artesunate or artemether-lumefantrine, dosed according to bodyweight, for 3 days.
   Results: Of 197 participants, 101 received pyronaridine-artesunate and 96 received artemether-lumefantrine. The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response in the per-protocol population, PCR-corrected for reinfections, was 98.9% (93/94, 95% CI 94.2-99.8) for pyronaridine-artesunate and 96.4% (81/84, 95% CI 90.0-98.8) for artemether-lumefantrine. Pyronaridine-artesunate was found to be non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine: the treatment difference was 2.5% (95% CI - 2.8 to 9.0). Adverse events occurred in 41.6% (42/101) and 34.4% (33/96) of patients in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and the artemether-lumefantrine group, respectively. No participants were found to have alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal.
   Conclusions: Pyronaridine-artesunate was well tolerated, efficacious and non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Kenyan children. Results are in line with previous reports and inclusion of pyronaridine-artesunate in paediatric malaria treatment programmes should be considered.

TI Gene expression of the liver of vaccination-protected mice in response
   to early patent infections of Plasmodium chabaudi blood-stage malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The role of the liver for survival of blood-stage malaria is only poorly understood. In experimental blood-stage malaria with Plasmodium chabaudi, protective vaccination induces healing and, thus, survival of otherwise lethal infections. This model is appropriate to study the role of the liver in vaccination-induced survival of bloodstage malaria.
   Methods: Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine consisting of plasma membranes isolated in the form of erythrocyte ghosts from P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes at week 3 and week 1 before infection with P. chabaudi blood-stage malaria. Gene expression microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the response of the liver, in terms of expression of mRNA and long intergenic non-coding (linc) RNA, to vaccination-induced healing infections and lethal P. chabaudi malaria at early patency on day 4 post infection, when parasitized erythrocytes begin to appear in peripheral blood.
   Results: In vaccination-induced healing infections, 23 genes were identified to be induced in the liver by > tenfold at p < 0.01. More than one-third were genes known to be involved in erythropoiesis, such as Kel, Rhag, Ahsp, Ermap, Slc4a1, Cldn13 Gata1, and Gfi1b. Another group of > tenfold expressed genes include genes involved in natural cytotoxicity, such as those encoding killer cell lectin-like receptors Klrb1a, Klrc3, Klrd1, the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor 1 Ncr1, as well as the granzyme B encoding Gzmb. Additionally, a series of genes involved in the control of cell cycle and mitosis were identified: Ccnb1, Cdc25c, Ckap2l were expressed > tenfold only in vaccination-protected mice, and the expression of 22 genes was at least 100% higher in vaccination-protected mice than in non-vaccinated mice. Furthermore, distinct lincRNA species were changed by > threefold in livers of vaccination-protected mice, whereas lethal malaria induced different lincRNAs.
   Conclusion: The present data suggest that protective vaccination accelerates the malaria-induced occurrence of extramedullary erythropoiesis, generation of liver-resident cytotoxic cells, and regeneration from malaria-induced injury in the liver at early patency, which may be critical for final survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria of P. chabaudi.

TI An innovative diagnostic technology for the codon mutation C580Y in
   kelch13 of Plasmodium falciparum with MinION nanopore sequencer
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The recent spread of artemisinin (ART)-resistant Plasmodium falciparum represents an emerging global threat to public health. In Southeast Asia, the C580Y mutation of kelch13 (k13) is the dominant mutation of ART-resistant P. falciparum. Therefore, a simple method for the detection of C580Y mutation is urgently needed to enable widespread routine surveillance in the field. The aim of this study is to develop a new diagnostic procedure for the C580Y mutation using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with the MinION nanopore sequencer.
   Results: A LAMP assay for the k13 gene of P. falciparum to detect the C580Y mutation was successfully developed. The detection limit of this procedure was 10 copies of the reference plasmid harboring the k13 gene within 60 min. Thereafter, amplicon sequencing of the LAMP products using the MinION nanopore sequencer was performed to clarify the nucleotide sequences of the gene. The C580Y mutation was identified based on the sequence data collected from MinION reads 30 min after the start of sequencing. Further, clinical evaluation of the LAMP assay in 34 human blood samples collected from patients with P. falciparum malaria in Indonesia revealed a positive detection rate of 100%. All LAMP amplicons of up to 12 specimens were simultaneously sequenced using MinION. The results of sequencing were consistent with those of the conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing protocol. All procedures from DNA extraction to variant calling were completed within 3 h. The C580Y mutation was not found among these 34 P. falciparum isolates in Indonesia.
   Conclusions: An innovative method combining LAMP and MinION will enable simple, rapid, and high-sensitivity detection of the C580Y mutation of P. falciparum, even in resource-limited situations in developing countries.

TI Plasmodium falciparum msp1 and msp2 genetic diversity and allele
   frequencies in parasites isolated from symptomatic malaria patients in
   Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: In Burkina Faso, malaria remains the overall leading cause of morbidity and mortality accounting for 35.12% of consultations, 40.83% of hospitalizations and 37.5% of deaths. Genotyping of malaria parasite populations remains an important tool to determine the types and number of parasite clones in an infection. The present study aimed to evaluate the merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) and merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) genetic diversity and allele frequencies in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.
   Method: Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at baseline from patients with uncomplicated malaria in urban health centers in Bobo-Dioulasso. Parasite DNA was extracted using chelex-100 and species were identified using nested PCR. Plamodium falciparum msp1 and msp2 genes were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel. Alleles were categorized according to their molecular weight.
   Results: A total of 228 blood samples were analyzed out of which 227 (99.9%) were confirmed as P. falciparum-positive and one sample classified as mixed infection for P. malaria and P. falciparum. In msp1, the K1 allelic family was predominant with 77.4% (162/209) followed respectively by the MAD20 allelic family with 41.3% and R033 allelic family with 36%. In msp2, the 3D7 allelic family was the most frequently detected with 93.1 % compared to FC27 with 41.3%. Twenty-one different alleles were observed in msp1 with 9 alleles for K1, 8 alleles for MAD20 and 4 alleles for R033. In msp2, 25 individual alleles were detected with 10 alleles for FC27 and 15 alleles for 3D7. The mean multiplicity of falciparum infection was 1.95 with respectively 1.8 (1.76-1.83) and 2.1 (2.03-2.16) for msp1 and msp2 (P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Our study showed high genetic diversity and allelic frequencies of msp1 and msp2 in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from symptomatic malaria patients in Bobo-Dioulasso.

TI Rapid and sensitive multiplex single-tube nested PCR for the
   identification of five human Plasmodium species
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium in humans. Microscopy is currently used for pathogen detection, requiring considerable training and technical expertise as the parasites are often difficult to differentiate morphologically. Rapid diagnostic tests are as reliable as microscopy and offer faster diagnoses but possess lower detection limits and are incapable of distinguishing among the parasitic species. To improve global health efforts towards malaria control, a rapid, sensitive, species-specific, and economically viable diagnostic method is needed. In this study, we designed a malaria diagnostic method involving a multiplex single-tube nested PCR targeting Plasmodium mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase III and single-stranded tag hybridization chromatographic printed-array strip. The detection sensitivity was found to be at least 40 times higher than that of agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. This system also enables the identification of both single- and mixed species malaria infections. The assay was validated with 152 Kenyan samples; using nested PCR as the standard, the assay's sensitivity and specificity were 88.7% and 100.0%, respectively. The turnaround time required, from PCR preparation to signal detection, is 90 min. Our method should improve the diagnostic speed, treatment efficacy, and control of malaria, in addition to facilitating surveillance within global malaria eradication programs.

TI Spatio-temporal distribution of mosquitoes and risk of malaria infection
   in Rwanda
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB To date, the Republic of Rwanda has not systematically reported on distribution, diversity and malaria infectivity rate of mosquito species throughout the country. Therefore, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of mosquitoes in the domestic environment, as well as the nocturnal biting behavior and infection patterns of the main malaria vectors in Rwanda. For this purpose, mosquitoes were collected monthly from 2010 to 2013 by human landing catches (HLC) and pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) in seven sentinel sites. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological characteristics and PCR. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates were determined using ELISA. A total of 340,684 mosquitoes was collected by HLC and 73.8% were morphologically identified as culicines and 26.2% as anophelines. Of the latter, 94.3% were Anopheles gambiae s.l., 0.4% Anopheles funestus and 5.3% other Anopheles species. Of An. gambiae s.l., An. arabiensis and An. gambiae s.s. represented 84.4% and 15.6%, respectively. Of all An. gambiae s.l. collected indoor and outdoor, the proportion collected indoors was 51.3% in 2010 and 44.9% in 2013. A total of 17,022 mosquitoes was collected by PSC of which 20.5% were An. gambiae s.l. and 79.5% were culicines. For the seven sentinel sites, the mean indoor density for An. gambiae s.l. varied from 0.0 to 1.0 mosquitoes/house/night. P. falciparum infection rates in mosquitoes varied from 0.87 to 4.06%. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) ranged from 1.0 to 329.8 with an annual average of 99.5 infective bites/person/year. This longitudinal study shows, for the first time, the abundance, species composition, and entomological inoculation rate of malaria mosquitoes collected throughout Rwanda.

TI Influence of polymorphisms in toll-like receptors (TLRs) on malaria
   susceptibility in low-endemic area of the Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo,
   Brazil
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB In low-endemic areas for malaria transmission, asymptomatic individuals play an important role as reservoirs for malarial infection. Understanding the dynamics of asymptomatic malaria is crucial for its efficient control in these regions. Genetic host factors such as Toll-like receptor CUR) polymorphisms may play a role in the maintenance or elimination of infection. In this study, the effect of TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malaria was investigated among individuals living in the Atlantic Forest of Sao Paulo, Southern Brazil. A hundred and ninety-five Brazilian individuals were enrolled and actively followed up for malaria for three years. Twenty-four polymorphisms in five toll-like receptor (TLR) genes were genotyped by RFLP, direct sequencing or fragment analysis. The genotypes were analyzed for the risk of malaria. Ongoing Plasmodium vivax or P. malaria infection, was identified by the positive results in PCR tests and previous P. vtvax malaria, was assumed when antiplasmodial antibodies against PvMSP1(19) were detected by ELISA. An evaluation of genomic ancestry was conducted using biallelic ancestry informative markers and the results were used as correction in the statistical analysis. Nine SNPs and one microsatellite were found polymorphic and three variant alleles in TLR genes were associated to malaria susceptibility. The regression coefficient estimated for SNP TLR9.-1237.T/C indicated that the presence of at least one allele C increased, on average, 2.3 times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C in this SNP. However, for individuals with the same sex, age and household, the presence of at least one allele C in SNP TLR9.-1486.T/C reduced, on average, 1.9 times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C. Moreover, this allele C plus an S allele in TLR6.P249S in individuals with same sex, age and ancestry, reduced, on average, 4.4 times the malaria odds. Our findings indicate a significant association of TLR9.-1237.T/C gene polymorphism with malarial infection and contribute to a better knowledge of the role of TLRs in malaria susceptibility in an epidemiological setting different from other settings.

TI Plasmodium falciparum infection transmitted by transfusion: A cause of
   hemophagocytic syndrome after bone marrow tranplantation in a
   non-endemic country
SO TRANSPLANT INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB A 27-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia underwent bone marrow transplantation from his HLA identical brother in July 2016. Conditioning included ATGAM 30mg/kg for 3days and Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg for 4days. The patient received several platelet and red blood cell transfusions before and after the conditioning. The patient received broad spectrum antibiotics and caspofungin because persistant febrile neutropenia without bacteriological or mycological documentation. Hemophagocytic syndrome was diagnosed on day +12. Steroids at 1mg/kg were started on day +12. Fever resolved the same day but resumed 3days later associated to intravascular hemolysis with no schizocytes on blood smears and negative DAT. Thick blood film smears performed on day +26 revealed Plasmodium falciparum parasites (parasitemia=20%). Except the level of parasitemia, there were no signs of gravity. Quinine was started on day 26 at a loading dose of 15mg/kg followed by 8mg/kg three times a day for 20 doses. Fever vanished after 2days. Parasitemia cleared in 3days and remained negative thereafter. Investigations revealed that the patient was transfused by a red cell unit harvested in a voluntary donor native of a malaria endemic country. PCR for P.falciparum performed in this donor in the frame of investigations was positive. The patient is alive with a normal blood count 1year after BMT.

   sustained, in BCG-infected mice co-infected with Plasmodium
SO MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of Plasmodium on the process of granuloma formation in Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-infected mice. Female six-week-old BALB/c mice were co-infected with BCG and Plasmodium. The liver index, pathological alterations and quantity of granulomas in the mice were observed when the mice were co-injected with BCG and Plasmodium. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In addition, the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 in liver tissues was observed by RT-PCR. Following co-infection with BCG and Plasmodium, the swelling of the liver had been slowly restored to normal, and the time required to allow granulomas to subside had prolonged. In addition, the expression of iNOS increased, while the expression of IL-10 gradually decreased in Plasmodium-infected mice. It was concluded that the use of Plasmodium relatively delayed granuloma formation in livers of BCG-infected mice. In addition, iNOS and IL-10 are involved in this pathogenesis.

TI Investigating zoonotic infection barriers to ape Plasmodium parasites
   using faecal DNA analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB African apes are endemically infected with numerous Plasmodium spp. including close relatives of human Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. Although these ape parasites are not believed to pose a zoonotic threat, their ability to colonise humans has not been fully explored. In particular, it remains unknown whether ape parasites are able to initiate exo-erythrocytic replication in human hepatocytes following the bite of an infective mosquito. Since animal studies have shown that liver stage infection can result in the excretion of parasite nucleic acids into the bile, we screened faecal samples from 504 rural Cameroonians for Plasmodium DNA. Using pan-Laverania as well as P. malariae- and P. vivax-specific primer sets, we amplified human P. falciparum (n = 14), P. malariae (n = 1), and P. ovate wallikeri (n = 1) mitochondrial sequences from faecal DNA of 15 individuals. However, despite using an intensified PCR screening approach we failed to detect ape Laverania, ape P. vivax or ape P. malariae parasites in these same subjects. One faecal sample from a hunter-gatherer contained a sequence closely related to the porcupine parasite Plasmodium atheruri. Since this same faecal sample also contained porcupine mitochondrial DNA, but a matching blood sample was Plasmodium negative, it is likely that this hunter-gatherer consumed Plasmodium-infected bushmeat. Faecal Plasmodium detection was not secondary to intestinal bleeding and/or infection with gastrointestinal parasites, but indicative of blood parasitaemia. Quantitative PCR identified 26-fold more parasite DNA in the blood of faecal Plasmodium-positive than faecal Plasmodium-negative individuals (P = 0.01). However, among blood-positive individuals only 10% - 20% had detectable Plasmodium sequences in their stool. Thus, faecal screening of rural Cameroonians failed to uncover abortive ape Plasmodium infections, but detected infection with human parasites, albeit with reduced sensitivity compared with blood analysis.

TI Prevalence and risk factors for asymptomatic malaria and genotyping of
   glucose 6-phosphate (G6PD) deficiencies in a vivax-predominant setting,
   Lao PDR: implications for sub-national elimination goals
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Lao People Democratic Republic (PDR; Laos), a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, has made important progress in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in the past 5-6 years, and the northern provinces have very low reported incidence. To support national progress towards elimination, it is critical to verify and understand these changes in disease burden.
   Methods: A two-stage cluster cross-sectional survey was conducted in four districts within four northern provinces (Khua, Phongsaly Province; Paktha, Bokeo Province; Nambak, Luang Prabang, and Muang Et, Huaphanh Province). During September and October 2016, demographics and malaria risk factors were collected from a total of 1492 households. A total of 5085 persons consented to collection of blood samples for testing, by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction ()-based testing. Risk factors for infection were examined using logistic regression; and a randomized subset of males was tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiencies using a combined PCR and sequencing approach.
   Results: There were zero positives by RDT, and PCR detected Plasmodium infections in 39 (0.77%; 95% CI 0.40-1.47%) of 5082 analysable samples. The species distribution was Plasmodium vivax (28 total); Plasmodium falciparum/P. vivax (5); P falciparum (3), Plasmodium malariae (2), and P vivax/P. malariae (1). In multivariable analysis, the main risk factors included having any other cases within the household [aOR 12.83 (95% CI 4.40 to 37.38), p < 0.001]; and lack of bed net ownership within the household [aOR 10.91 (95% 5.42-21.94), p < 0.001]; age, sex and forest-travel were not associated with parasitaemia. A total of 910 males were tested for the six most common G6PDd in SE Asia; and 30 (3.3%; 95% CI 2.1-5.1%) had a G6PD variant allele associated with G6PD deficiency, with the majority being the Union (14) and Viangchan (11) polymorphisms, with smaller numbers of Canton and Mahidol.
   Conclusion: This is the first rigorous PCR-based population survey for malaria infection in Northern Lao PDR, and found a very low prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections by standard PCR methods, with P vivax predominating in the surveyed districts. Clustering of cases within households, and lack of a bed nets suggest reactive case detection, and scale-up of coverage should be prioritized. The predominance of infections with P vivax, combined with moderate levels of serious G6PD deficiencies highlight the need for careful rollout of primaquine towards elimination goals.

TI Exposure and infection to Plasmodium knowlesi in case study communities
   in Northern Sabah, Malaysia and Palawan, The Philippines
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Primarily impacting poor, rural populations, the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi is now the main cause of human malaria within Malaysian Borneo. While data is increasingly available on symptomatic cases, little is known about community-level patterns of exposure and infection. Understanding the true burden of disease and associated risk factors within endemic communities is critical for informing evidence-based control measures.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted comprehensive surveys in three areas where P. knowlesi transmission is reported: Limbuak, Pulau Banggi and Matunggung, Kudat, Sabah, Malaysia and Bacungan, Palawan, the Philippines. Infection prevalence was low with parasites detected by PCR in only 0.2% (4/2503) of the population. P. knowlesi PkSERA3 ag1 antibody responses were detected in 7.1% (95% CI: 6.2-8.2%) of the population, compared with 16.1% (14.6-17.7%) and 12.6% (11.2-14.1%) for P. falciparum and P. vivax. Sero-prevalence was low in individuals <10 years old for P. falciparum and P. vivax consistent with decreased transmission of non-zoonotic malaria species. Results indicated marked heterogeneity in transmission intensity between sites and P. knowlesi exposure was associated with agricultural work (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.48) and higher levels of forest cover (OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.29-4.46) and clearing (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.35-3.40) around houses. Spatial patterns of P. knowlesi exposure differed from exposure to non-zoonotic malaria and P. knowlesi exposed individuals were younger on average than individuals exposed to non-zoonotic malaria.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This is the first study to describe serological exposure to P. knowlesi and associated risk factors within endemic communities. Results indicate community-level patterns of infection and exposure differ markedly from demographics of reported cases, with higher levels of exposure among women and children. Further work is needed to understand these variations in risk across a wider population and spatial scale.

TI Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte dynamics after pyronaridine-artesunate
   or artemether-lumefantrine treatment
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin-based combinations differ in their impact on gametocyte prevalence and density. This study assessed female and male gametocyte dynamics after treating children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria with either pyronaridine-artesunate (PA) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL).
   Methods: Kenyan children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were included and randomly assigned to PA or AL treatment. Filter paper blood samples were collected as a source of RNA for quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA) to detect female gametocytes (targeting Pfs25 mRNA). Male gametocytes were detected by qRT-PCR (targeting PfMGET mRNA). Duration of gametocyte carriage, the female and male gametocyte response and the agreement between qRT-PCR and QT-NASBA were determined.
   Results: The mean duration of female gametocyte carriage was significantly longer for PA (4.9 days) than for AL (3.8 days) as estimated by QT-NASBA (P=0.036), but this difference was less clear when determined by Pfs25 qRT-PCR (4.5 days for PA and 3.7 for AL, P=0.166). qRT-PCR based female gametocyte prevalence decreased from 100% (75/75) at baseline to 6.06% (4/66) at day 14 in the AL group and from 97.7% (83/85) to 13.9% (11/79) in the PA group. Male gametocyte prevalence decreased from 41.3% (31/75) at baseline to 19.7% (13/66) at day 14 in the AL group and from 35.3% (30/85) to 22.8% (18/79) in the PA group. There was good agreement between Pfs25 qRT-PCR and QT-NASBA female gametocyte prevalence (0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.87).
   Conclusions: This study indicates that female gametocyte clearance may be slightly faster after AL compared to PA. Male gametocytes showed similar post-treatment clearance between study arms. Future studies should further address potential differences between the post-treatment transmission potential after PA compared to AL.

TI Genetic diversity and transmissibility of imported Plasmodium vivax in
   Qatar and three countries of origin
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria control program in the Arabian Peninsula, backed by adequate logistical support, has interrupted transmission with exception of limited sites in Saudi Arabia and sporadic outbreaks in Oman. However, sustained influx of imported malaria represents a direct threat to the above success. Here we examined the extent of genetic diversity among imported P. vivax in Qatar, and its ability to produce gametocytes, compared to parasites in main sites of imported cases, the Indian subcontinent (india) and East Africa (Sudan and Ethiopia). High diversity was seen among imported P. vivax in Qatar, comparable to parasites in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. Limited genetic differentiation was seen among imported P. vivax, which overlapped with parasites in India, but differentiated from that in Sudan and Ethiopia. Parasite density among imported cases, ranged widely between 26.25-7985934.1 Pv18S rRNA copies/mu l blood, with a high prevalence of infections carried gametocytes detectable by qRT-PCR. Parasitaemia was a stronger predictor for P. vivax gametocytes density (r = 0.211, P = 0.04). The extensive diversity of imported P. vivax and its ability to produce gametocytes represent a major threat for re-introduction of malaria in Qatar. The genetic relatedness between P. vivax reported in Qatar and those in India suggest that elimination strategy should target flow and dispersal of imported malaria into the region.

TI Seasonal variations in Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence
   assessed by varying diagnostic tests in asymptomatic children in
   southern Ghana
SO PLOS ONE
AB Plasmodium falciparum infections presenting either as symptomatic or asymptomatic may contain sexual stage parasites (gametocytes) that are crucial to malaria transmission. In this study, the prevalence of microscopic and submicroscopic asexual and gametocyte parasite stages were assessed in asymptomatic children from two communities in southern Ghana. Eighty children aged twelve years and below, none of whom exhibited signs of clinical malaria living in Obom and Cape Coast were sampled twice, one during the rainy (July 2015) and subsequently during the dry (January 2016) season. Venous blood was used to prepare thick and thin blood smears, spot a rapid malaria diagnostic test (PfHRP2 RDT) as well as prepare filter paper blood spots. Blood cell pellets were preserved in Trizol for RNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and semi-quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine submicroscopic parasite prevalence. In both sites 87% (95% CI: 78-96) of the asymptomatic individuals surveyed were parasites positive during the 6 month study period. The prevalence of asexual and gametocyte stage parasites in the rainy season were both significantly higher in Obom than in Cape Coast (P < 0.001). Submicroscopic gametocyte prevalence was highest in the rainy season in Obom but in the dry season in Cape Coast. Parasite prevalence determined by PCR was similar to that determined by qRT-PCR in Obom but significantly lower than that determined by qRT-PCR in Cape Coast. Communities with varying parasite prevalence exhibit seasonal variations in the prevalence of gametocyte carriers. Submicroscopic asymptomatic parasite and gametocyte carriage is very high in southern Ghana, even during the dry season in communities with low microscopic parasite prevalence and likely to be missed during national surveillance exercises.

TI Efficacy and Safety of Fosmidomycin-Piperaquine as Nonartemisinin-Based
   Combination Therapy for Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria: A Single-Arm,
   Age De-escalation Proof-of-Concept Study in Gabon
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Fosmidomycin-piperaquine is being developed as nonartemisinin-based combination therapy to meet the challenge of emerging artemisinin resistance.
   Methods. The study was a phase 2, single-arm, proof-of-concept study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of fosmidomycin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection in Gabon. Adults and children of both sexes with initial parasite counts between 1000 and 150 000/mu L received oral treatment with fosmidomycin (twice daily doses of 30 mg/kg) and piperaquine (once daily dose of 16 mg/kg) for 3 days and followed-up for 63 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the per-protocol polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected day 28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR).
   Results. One hundred patients were enrolled. The PCR-corrected day 28 ACPR rate was 83/83, or 100% (95% confidence interval, 96-100). Fourteen patients had asexual parasitaemia between day 28 and day 63; all were typed by PCR as new infections. Fosmidomycin-piperaquine therapy led to rapid parasite clearance (median, 36 hours; interquartile range [IQR], 6-60) and fever clearance time (median, 12 hours; IQR, 6-48). The electrocardiogram assessments showed 2 patients with prolonged QT interval >500 msec following study drug administration. The majority of adverse events affected the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and were transient and mild to moderate in severity.
   Conclusions. This is the first report of the use of the combination fosmidomycin-piperaquine. The combination appeared to have high efficacy and be safe and well tolerated despite observed transient changes in electrocardiogram with prolongation of the QT interval .

TI The Relative Contribution of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Plasmodium
   vivax and Plasmodium falciparum Infections to the Infectious Reservoir
   in a Low-Endemic Setting in Ethiopia
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The majority of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections in low-endemic settings are asymptomatic. The relative contribution to the infectious reservoir of these infections compared to clinical malaria cases is currently unknown.
   Methods. We assessed infectivity of passively recruited symptomatic malaria patients (n = 41) and community-recruited asymptomatic individuals with microscopy-detected (n = 41) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detected infections (n = 82) using membrane feeding assays with Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes in Adama, Ethiopia. Malaria incidence and prevalence data were used to estimate the contributions of these populations to the infectious reservoir.
   Results. Overall, 34.9% (29/83) of P. vivax-and 15.1% (8/53) P. falciparum-infected individuals infected = 1 mosquitoes. Mosquito infection rates were strongly correlated with asexual parasite density for P. vivax (rho = 0.63; P < .001) but not for P. falciparum (rho = 0.06; P = .770). Plasmodium vivax symptomatic infections were more infectious to mosquitoes (infecting 46.5% of mosquitoes, 307/660) compared to asymptomatic microscopy-detected (infecting 12.0% of mosquitoes, 80/667; P = .005) and PCR-detected infections (infecting 0.8% of mosquitoes, 6/744; P < .001). Adjusting for population prevalence, symptomatic, asymptomatic microscopy-detected, and PCR-detected infections were responsible for 8.0%, 76.2%, and 15.8% of the infectious reservoir for P. vivax, respectively. For P. falciparum, mosquito infections were sparser and also predominantly from asymptomatic infections.
   Conclusions. In this low-endemic setting aiming for malaria elimination, asymptomatic infections were highly prevalent and responsible for the majority of onward mosquito infections. The early identification and treatment of asymptomatic infections might accelerate elimination efforts.

TI Identification and characterization of DNA endonucleases in Plasmodium
   falciparum 3D7 clone
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent parasite of the five Plasmodium species that cause human malaria, and biological analysis of the parasite is critical for the development of novel strategies for disease control. DNA endonucleases are important for maintaining the biological activity, gene stability of the parasite and interaction with host immune systems. In this study, ten sequences of DNA endonucleases were found in the genome of P. falciparum 3D7 clone, seven of them were predicted to contain an endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (IPR005135) domain which plays an important role in DNA catalytic activity. The seven DNA endonucleases of P. falciparum were systematically investigated.
   Methods: Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 clone was cultured in human O+ RBCs, RNA was extracted at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 h post invasion and real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to analyse the transcription of the seven DNA endonuclease genes in asexual stages. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to confirm the location of the encoded proteins expressed in the erythrocytic stages. Finally, the catalytic activity of the DNA nucleases were tested.
   Results: Of the seven proteins analysed, two proteins were not soluble. Fragments derived from the rest five endonuclease sequences were successfully expressed as soluble proteins, and which were used to generate antisera for protein localization. The proteins were all located in the nucleus at ring and trophozoite stages. While at schizont stage, proteins encoded by PF3D7_1238600, PF3D7_0107200 and PF3D7_0319200 were in the punctuated forms in the parasite most likely around nuclei of the merozoites. But the proteins encoded by PF3D7_0305600 and PF3D7_1363500 were distributed around the infected erythrocyte membrane. The enzymatic activity of the recombinant GST-PF3D7_1238600 was very efficient without divalent iron, while the activity of the rest four enzymes was iron dependent. Further, divalent irons did not show any specific enhancement on the activity of GST-PF3D7_1238600, but the activity of GST-PF3D7_0107200, GST-PF3D7_1363500 and GST-PF3D7_0319200 were Cu2+ dependent. The activity of GST-PF3D7_0305600 was dependent on Mg2+ and Mn2+. Except GST-PF3D7_1363500, four of the GST tagged recombinant proteins hydrolysed the supercoiled circular plasmid DNA with or without divalent metal ions. The GSTPF3D7_1363500 protein only changed the supercoiled circular plasmid DNA into nicked plasmids, even with Cu2+.
   Conclusions: Fragments derived from five of the endonuclease sequences of P. falciparum 3D7 clone were successfully expressed. The proteins displayed diverse cell distribution, biochemical and enzymatic activities, which indicated that they carried different biological function in the development of the parasite in the erythrocytes. The DNA repair and DNA degradation capacity of the DNA endonucleases in the biology of the parasite remained further studied.

TI In situ loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for identification
   of Plasmodium species in wide-range thin blood smears
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Five species of Plasmodium are known to infect humans. For proper treatment of malaria, accurate identification of the parasite species is crucial. The current gold standard for malaria diagnosis is microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Since the parasite species are identified by microscopists who manually search for the parasite-infected red blood cells (RBCs), misdiagnosis due to human error tends to occur in case of low parasitaemia or mixed infection. Then, molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are required for conclusive identification of the parasite species. However, since molecular methods are highly sensitive, false-positive results tend to occur due to contamination (carry over) or the target gene products may be detected even after clearance of the parasites from the patient's blood. Therefore, accurate detection of parasites themselves by microscopic examination is essential for the definitive diagnosis. Thus, the method of in situ LAMP for the parasites was developed.
   Results: Red blood cell suspensions, including cultured Plasmodium falciparum, strain 3D7, infected-RBCs, were dispersed on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) plate surfaces rendered hydrophilic by reactive ion-etching treatment using a SAMCO RIE system (hydrophilic-treated), followed by standing for 10 min to allow the RBCs to settle down on the plate surface. By rinsing the plate with RPMI 1640 medium, monolayers of RBCs formed on almost the entire plate surface. The plate was then dried with a hair drier. The RBCs were fixed with formalin, followed by permeabilization with Triton X-100. Then, amplification of the P.falciparum 18S rRNA gene by the LAMP reaction with digoxigenin (DIG)labelled dUTP and a specific primer set was performed. Infected RBCs as fluorescence-positive cells with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated with fluorescein using fluorescent microscopy could be detected.
   Conclusions: The present work shows that the potential of in situ LAMP for the identification of Plasmodium species at the single cell level on hydrophilic-treated COC palates, allowing highly sensitive and accurate malaria diagnosis. The findings will improve the efficacy of the gold standard method for malaria diagnosis.

TI Label-free, high-throughput detection of P-falciparum infection in
   sphered erythrocytes with digital holographic microscopy
SO LAB ON A CHIP
AB Effective malaria treatment requires rapid and accurate diagnosis of infecting species and actual parasitemia. Despite the recent success of rapid tests, the analysis of thick and thin blood smears remains the gold standard for routine malaria diagnosis in endemic areas. For non-endemic regions, sample preparation and analysis of blood smears are an issue due to low microscopy expertise and few cases of imported malaria. Automation of microscopy results could be beneficial to quickly confirm suspected infections in such conditions. Here, we present a label-free, high-throughput method for early malaria detection with the potential to reduce inter-observer variation by reducing sample preparation and analysis effort. We used differential digital holographic microscopy in combination with two-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing for the label-free detection of P. falciparum infection in sphered erythrocytes, with a parasitemia detection limit of 0.01%. Moreover, the achieved differentiation of P. falciparum ring-, trophozoite- and schizont life cycle stages in synchronized cultures demonstrates the potential for future discrimination of even malaria species.

TI PCR-based detection of Plasmodium falciparum in saliva using
   mitochondrial cox3 and varATS primers
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background: Sampling of saliva for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum infections is a safe, non-invasive alternative to sampling of blood. However, the use of saliva presents a challenge because lower concentrations of parasite DNA are present in saliva compared to peripheral blood. Therefore, a sensitive method is needed for detection of parasite DNA in saliva. This study utilized two recently reported "ultra-sensitive" PCR assays based on detection of the P. falciparum mitochondrial cox3 gene and the multi-copy nuclear varATS gene. The ultra-sensitive assays have an advantage over standard 18S rRNA gene-based PCR assay as they target genes with higher copy numbers per parasite genome. Stored saliva DNA samples from 60 Cameroonian individuals with infections previously confirmed by 18S rRNA gene PCR in peripheral blood were tested with assays targeting the cox3 and varATS genes.
   Results: Overall, the standard 18S rRNA gene-based PCR assay detected P. falciparum DNA in 62% of the stored saliva DNA samples, whereas 77 and 68% of the samples were positive with assays that target the cox3 and varATS genes, respectively. Interestingly, the ultra-sensitive assays detected more P. falciparum infections in stored saliva samples than were originally detected by thick-film microscopy (41/60 = 68%). When stratified by number of parasites in the blood, the cox3 assay successfully detected more than 90% of infections using saliva when individuals had > 1000 parasites/mu l of peripheral blood, but sensitivity was reduced at submicroscopic parasitemia levels. Bands on electrophoresis gels were distinct for the cox3 assay, whereas faint or non-specific bands were sometimes observed for varATS and 18S rRNA that made interpretation of results difficult. Assays could be completed in 3.5 and 3 h for the cox3 and varATS assays, respectively, whereas the 18S rRNA gene assays required at least 7 h.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a PCR assay targeting the cox3 gene detected P. falciparum DNA in more saliva samples than primers for the 18S rRNA gene. Non-invasive collection of saliva in combination with the proposed cox3 primer-based PCR assay could potentially enhance routine testing of P. falciparum during disease surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation of interventions for malaria elimination.

TI Fully 3D printed integrated reactor array for point-of-care molecular
   diagnostics
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Molecular diagnostics that involve nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are crucial for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we developed a simple, inexpensive, disposable, fully 3D printed microfluidic reactor array that is capable of carrying out extraction, concentration and isothermal amplification of nucleic acids in variety of body fluids. The method allows rapid molecular diagnostic tests for infectious diseases at point of care. A simple leak-proof polymerization strategy was developed to integrate flow-through nucleic acid isolation membranes into microfluidic devices, yielding a multifunctional diagnostic platform. Static coating technology was adopted to improve the biocompatibility of our 3D printed device. We demonstrated the suitability of our device for both end-point colorimetric qualitative detection and real-time fluorescence quantitative detection. We applied our diagnostic device to detection of Plasmodium falciparum in plasma samples and Neisseria meningitides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples by loop-mediated, isothermal amplification (LAMP) within 50 min. The detection limits were 100 fg for P. falciparum and 50 colony-forming unit (CFU) for N. meningitidis per reaction, which are comparable to that of benchtop instruments. This rapid and inexpensive 3D printed device has great potential for point-of-care molecular diagnosis of infectious disease in resource-limited settings.

TI Evaluation of four novel isothermal amplification assays towards simple
   and rapid genotyping of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum
SO EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY
AB Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is sensitive, prompt, high throughput and field deployable technique for nucleic acid amplification under isothermal conditions. In this study, we have developed and optimized four different visualization methods of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect Pfcrt K76T mutants of P. falciparum and compared their important features for one-pot in-field applications. Even though all the four tested LAMP methods could successfully detect K76T mutants of P. falciparum, however considering the time, safety, sensitivity, cost and simplicity, the malachite green and HNB based methods were found more efficient. Among four different visual dyes uses to detect LAMP products accurately, hydroxynaphthol blue and malachite green could produce long stable color change and brightness in a close tube-based approach to prevent cross-contamination risk. Our results indicated that the LAMP offers an interesting novel and convenient best method for the rapid, sensitive, cost-effective, and fairly user friendly tool for detection of K76T mutants of P. falciparum and therefore presents an alternative to PCR-based assays. Based on our comparative analysis, better field based LAMP visualization method can be chosen easily for the monitoring of other important drug targets (Kelch13 propeller region).

TI Genetic Diversity in C-terminal of SERA5 Gene in the Blood Stage of
   Human Isolates of Plasmodium vivax in Sistan and Baluchistan, Iran
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: Vivax malaria is more prevalent in the malarious areas of Iran, which makes vaccine research a high priority. Serine Repeat Antigens (SERA) have essential role in the parasite life cycle and high expression profiles of PvSERA5 make it suitable vaccine candidates. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity of C-terminal region of PvSERA5 in Iranian isolates of Plasmodium vivax in Sistan and Baluchistan.
   Methods: Totally, 49 blood samples were taken from symptomatic malaria patients in Sistan and Baluchistan Province in 2016. Mono-infection to P. vivax was confirmed by 18srRNA-Nested-PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted and C-terminal region of PvSERA5 was amplified by specific primers. PCR-products have been sequenced and analysis was done by using bioinformatics software, mainly DnaSP & MEGA5.
   Results: Genetic diversity was calculated 14.8% in C-terminal region of PvSERA5 in Iranian isolates, 19 different sequences and 4 haplotypes existed. The amount of Tajima's D (0.3805) and ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutation (1.82) showed that C-terminal region of PvSERA5 is under positive natural selection; also intragenic recombination could interfere.
   Conclusion: Results could be helpful in any research, regarding this antigen as vaccine candidate in Iran or worldwide.

TI Plasmodium falciparum merozoite protein-1 genetic diversity and
   multiplicity of infection in isolates from Congolese children consulting
   in a pediatric hospital in Brazzaville
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB As in many sub-Saharan African countries, the burden of malaria has been reduced in the Republic of Congo as a result of massive deployment of insecticide treated nets and availability of artemisinin-combinations therapies (ACTs). High to moderate genetic diversity of msp-1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) has been reported from different parts of the world but limited data are available from Central Africa including the Republic of Congo. For this reason, the aim of study was to investigate the P. falciparum genetic diversity and to determine the multiplicity of infection in P. falciparum isolates from Congolese children in order to dispose of an additional parameter to measure the impact malaria control intervention. A total of 229 blood samples were collected from September 2014 to February 2015 in children aged from one to ten years presenting a paediatric hospital Marien NGOUABI located in Northern part of Brazzaville. Inclusion criterion was fever (axillary temperature >= 37.5 C-degrees) or history of fever in the preceding 48 h before inclusion in this study. Then thick and thin blood smears were done to detect malaria parasites, to determine parasite density and to identify plasmodial species. Sub-microscopic infection was detected by PCR using the P. falciparum msp-1 gene as molecular marker. The prevalence of microscopic and sub-microscopic infection in this cohort was 10% and 27.5%, respectively. The K1 allelic family was predominant (45% of isolates) whereas the RO33 and MAD20 represented 35% and 20%, respectively of isolates. In this study 48% (38/79) of isolates harbored more than one parasite clone. Overall the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 1.7. According to type of infection, the MOI was significantly higher in children with microscopic infection (2.5 vs 1.4 for submicroscopic infection, P = .001). When considering age, hemoglobin genotype (AA or AS) and level and parasite density, no association was observed with the MOI. This study reveals that the P. falciparum genetic diversity in isolates from Congolese children is high but with low multiplicity of infection.

TI The Complement System Contributes to Functional Antibody Mediated
   Responses Induced by Immunization with Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
   Sporozoites
SO INFECTION AND IMMUNITY
AB Long-lasting and sterile homologous protection against malaria can be achieved by the exposure of malaria-naive volunteers under chemoprophylaxis to Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes (chemoprophylaxis and sporozoite [CPS] immunization). While CPS-induced antibodies neutralize sporozoite infectivity in vitro and in vivo, antibody-mediated effector mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether complement contributes to CPS-induced preerythrocytic immunity. Sera collected before and after CPS immunization in the presence of active or inactive complement were assessed for the recognition of homologous NF54 and heterologous NF135.C10 sporozoites, complement fixation, sporozoite lysis, and possible subsequent effects on in vitro sporozoite infectivity in human hepatocytes. CPS immunization induced sporozoite-specific IgM (P < 0.0001) and IgG (P = 0.001) antibodies with complement-fixing capacities (P < 0.0001). Sporozoite lysis (P = 0.017), traversal (P < 0.0001), and hepatocyte invasion inhibition (P < 0.0001) by CPS-induced antibodies were strongly enhanced in the presence of active complement. Complement-mediated invasion inhibition in the presence of CPS-induced antibodies negatively correlated with cumulative parasitemia during CPS immunizations (P = 0.013). While IgG antibodies similarly recognized homologous and heterologous sporozoites, IgM binding to heterologous sporozoites was reduced (P = 0.023). Although CPS-induced antibodies did not differ in their abilities to fix complement, lyse sporozoites, or inhibit the traversal of homologous and heterologous sporozoites, heterologous sporozoite invasion was more strongly inhibited in the presence of active complement (P = 0.008). These findings demonstrate that CPS-induced antibodies have complement-fixing activity, thereby significantly further enhancing the functional inhibition of homologous and heterologous sporozoite infectivity in vitro. The combined data highlight the importance of complement as an additional immune effector mechanism in preerythrocytic immunity after whole-parasite immunization against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

TI Serological and molecular techniques applied for identification of
   Plasmodium spp. in blood samples from nonhuman primates
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA
AB The aim of this study was to identify Plasmodium spp. in blood samples from nonhuman primates (NHPs) in the state of Maranhao, using classical and alternative techniques for examination of human malaria. A total of 161 blood samples from NHPs were analyzed: 141 from captive animals at a Wildlife Screening Center (CETAS) and 20 from free-living animals in a private reserve. The techniques used were microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), Indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and molecular techniques (semi-nested PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and LAMP). Two serological methods (dot-ELISA and indirect ELISA) were also standardized with rhoptry protein-soluble antigen of P. falciparum and P. berghei. Trophozoite forms of Plasmodium sp. were identified on slides from five different animals. No samples were positive through RDT and LAMP. Four samples were seropositive for P. malariae through IFAT. The samples showed low reactivity to ELISA. Plasmodium sp. was detected in 34.16% (55/161) of the samples using qPCR based on the 18S rRNA gene. After sequencing, two samples showed 100% identityl to P. malariae, one showed 97% identity to Plasmodium sp. ZOOBH and one showed 99% identity to P. falciparum. PCR was shown to be the most sensitive technique for diagnosing Plasmodium in NHP samples.

TI Efficacy of two artemisinin-based combinations for the treatment of
   malaria in pregnancy in India: a randomized controlled trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In India, the recommended first-line treatment for malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy is artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP). However, data on safety and efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in pregnancy is limited. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of AS+SP and artesunate + mefloguine (AS+MQ) for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy in India.
   Methods: This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2010 to December 2013 at three sites in India (Ranchi and Jamshedpur in Jharkhand state, and Rourkela in Odisha state). Pregnant women in the second or third trimester who had P. falciparum mono-infection of any parasite density with or without fever were randomized to receive AS+SP or AS+MQ. Blood slides and filter paper samples for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were collected on days 0,1,2,3,14,21,28,42 and 63 post treatment Women were followed up at delivery and at day 42 postpartum.
   Findings: Two hundred and forty-eight women of 7064 pregnant women (3.5%) who were screened at monthly antenatal clinics had a P. falciparum mono-infection and were randomized to receive AS+SP (125) or AS+MQ (123) and all of these women were included in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. The primary endpoint of an adeguate clinical and parasite response (ACPR) on day 63 was not available for 9 women who were counted as treatment failure in the ITT analysis. In the ITT population, the ACPR was 121/125 (96.8%, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 92.0-99.1%) in the AS+SP group and 117/123 (95.1%, 95% CI 89.7-98.2) in the AS+MQ group. Among the 239 women (121 from the AS+SP arm and 118 from the AS+MQ arm) who completed the day 63 follow up (per protocol analysis) the ACPR was 100% in the AS+SP group and 99.2% (117/118) in the AS+MQ group. There were five serious adverse events (SAE) among pregnant women (4 in the AS+SP group and 1 in the AS+MQ group) and 13 fetal/neonatal SAEs (7 in the AS+SP group and 6 in the AS+MQ) but none of them were related to the study drugs. A higher proportion of women in the AS+MQ arm reported vomiting within 7 days post-treatment than did women in the AS+SP arm (6.9 vs 1.6%, p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Both AS+SP and AS+MQ are safe and effective for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy in India.

TI Risk factors for asymptomatic malaria infections from seasonal
   cross-sectional surveys along the China-Myanmar border
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Border malaria, a shared phenomenon in the Greater Mekong Sub-region of Southeast Asia, is a major obstacle for regional malaria elimination. Along the China-Myanmar border, an additional problem arose as a result of the settlement of internally displaced people (IDP) in the border region. Since asymptomatic malaria significantly impacts transmission dynamics, assessment of the prevalence, dynamics and risk factors of asymptomatic malaria infections is necessary.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in 3 seasons (March and April, July and November) and 2 sites (villages and IDP camps) in 2015. A total of 1680 finger-prick blood samples were collected and used for parasite detection by microscopy and nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR). Logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with asymptomatic malaria at individual and household levels.
   Results: The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections was 23.3% by nRT-PCR, significantly higher than that detected by microscopy (1.5%). The proportions of Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed-species infections were 89.6,8.1 and 2.3%, respectively. Asymptomatic infections showed obvious seasonality with higher prevalence in the rainy season. Logistic regression analysis identified males and school children (<= 15 years) as the high-risk populations. Vector-based interventions, including bed net and indoor residual spray, were found to have significant impacts on asymptomatic Plasmodium infections, with non-users of these measures carrying much higher risks of infection. In addition, individuals living in poorly constructed households or farther away from clinics were more prone to asymptomatic infections.
   Conclusions: Sub-microscopic Plasmodium infections were highly prevalent in the border human populations from IDP camps and surrounding villages. Both individual- and household-level risk factors were identified, which provides useful information for identifying the high-priority populations to implement targeted malaria control.

TI Identifying Recrudescent Plasmodium falciparum in Treated Malaria
   Patients by Real-time PCR and High Resolution Melt Analysis of Genetic
   Diversity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recurrent parasitaemia during follow up of clinical trials of antimalarial drug efficacy results from either recrudescence of parasites surviving treatment or from parasites newly emerging from the hepatic stage of infection. Nested PCR is used to distinguish these two possibilities and the technique is difficult to standardise. There is risk of both false positive and false negative results, leading to misclassification errors. The high-resolution melt (HRM) assay was developed with pairs of conserved primers targeting blocks of merozoite surface protein 1 and 2 (msp1 and msp2) genes, and polymorphisms were compared using sequence-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum DNA samples from laboratory isolates. In this study, the HRM dissociation profiles of msp1 and msp2 amplicons were determined and validated against parasite isolates from malaria patients. The msp1 and msp2 profiles of both laboratory and clinical isolates were reproducibly differentiated by HRM. These rapid assays are performed in a closed-tube system, and so avoid cross-contamination while increasing throughput, which are two major advantages. The HRM assays offer significant gains in simplicity, speed and interpretation of results, and reduced analysis cost, for studies that require discrimination of parasite clones. Assay performance in large-scale studies utilizing DNA samples derived from filter-paper bloodspots should now be evaluated.

TI Assessing Plasmodium falciparum transmission in mosquito-feeding assays
   using quantitative PCR
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Evaluating the efficacy of transmission-blocking interventions relies on mosquito-feeding assays, with transmission typically assessed by microscopic identification of oocysts in mosquito midguts; however, microscopy has limited throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Where low prevalence and intensity mosquito infections occur, as observed during controlled human malaria infection studies or natural transmission, a reliable method for detection and quantification of low-level midgut infection is required. Here, a semi-automated, Taqman quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay sufficiently sensitive to detect a single-oocyst midgut infection is described.
   Results: Extraction of genomic DNA from Anopheles stephensi midguts using a semi-automated extraction process was shown to have equivalent extraction efficiency to manual DNA extraction. An 18S Plasmodium falciparum qPCR assay was adapted for quantitative detection of P. falciparum midgut oocyst infection using synthetic DNA standards. The assay was validated for sensitivity and specificity, and the limit of detection was 0.7 genomes/mu L (95% CI 0.4-1.6 genomes/mu L). All microscopy-confirmed oocyst infected midgut samples were detected by qPCR, including all single-oocyst positive midguts. The genome number per oocyst was assessed 8-9 days after feeding assay using both qPCR and droplet digital PCR and was 3722 (IQR: 2951-5453) and 3490 (IQR: 2720-4182), respectively.
   Conclusions: This semi-automated qPCR method enables accurate detection of low-level P. falciparum oocyst infections in mosquito midguts, and may improve the sensitivity, specificity and throughput of assays used to evaluate candidate transmission-blocking interventions.

TI Introduction of F446I mutation in the K13 propeller gene leads to
   increased ring survival rates in Plasmodium falciparum isolates
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum k13 gene are associated with artemisinin (ART) resistance. However, it is unclear whether the F446I mutation, the most prevalent allele at the China-Myanmar border and north of Myanmar, is associated with ART resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of this mutation in ART resistance by generating transgenic parasites expressing the F446I mutant allele.
   Methods: The transgenic parasites carrying the F446I or C580Y mutation in both 3D7 and FCC1/HN isolates were generated by single crossing-over recombination and verified using PCR and gene sequencing. The ring-stage survival assay of 0-3 h -(RSA(0-3) h) was used to evaluate ART susceptibility of the transgenic parasites in vitro.
   Results: Four transgenic parasite lines named -3D7(F446I mut), -3D7(C580Y) (mut), FCC1/HNF446I (mut) and FCC1/HNC580Y (mut) were successfully generated. These parasite lines showed no changes in the expression level of k13 when compared with their parent parasite isolates. However, introduction of the F446I mutation in k13 of the 3D7 and FCC1/HN isolates led to elevated ring survival rates detected using -RSA(0-3) (h) when subjected to both 700 and 20 nM concentrations of dihydroartemisinin. The survival rates were similar to those detected in the parasite lines with the C580Y mutation.
   Conclusions: Insertion of the F446I mutation in k13 led to increased ring survival, suggesting that this mutation may be associated with ART resistance and could be used as a molecular marker for monitoring ART-resistant parasites. The results also highlights the importance of surveillance of F446I mutants for containing the resistant parasite.

TI Evidence for histidine-rich protein 2 immune complex formation in
   symptomatic patients in Southern Zambia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) detection are the primary tools used to detect Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections. Recent conflicting reports call into question whether alpha-HRP2 antibodies are present in human host circulation and if resulting immune complexes could interfere with HRP2 detection on malaria RDTs. This study sought to determine the prevalence of immune-complexed HRP2 in a low-transmission region of Southern Zambia.
   Methods: An ELISA was used to quantify HRP2 in patient sample DBS extracts before and after heat-based immune complex dissociation. A pull-down assay reliant on proteins A, G, and L was developed and applied for IgG and IgM capture and subsequent immunoprecipitation of any HRP2 present in immune complexed form. A total of 104 patient samples were evaluated using both methods.
   Results: Immune-complexed HRP2 was detectable in 17% (18/104) of all samples evaluated and 70% (16/23) of HRP2-positive samples. A majority of the patients with samples containing immune-complexed HRP2 had P. falciparum infections (11/18) and were also positive for free HRP2 (16/18). For 72% (13/18) of patients with immune-complexed HRP2, less than 10% of the total HRP2 present was in immune-complexed form. For the remaining samples, a large proportion (>= 20%) of total HRP2 was complexed with alpha-HRP2 antibodies.
   Conclusions: Endogenous alpha-HRP2 antibodies form immune complexes with HRP2 in the symptomatic patient population of a low-transmission area in rural Southern Zambia. For the majority of patients, the percentage of HRP2 in immune complexes is low and does not affect HRP2-based malaria diagnosis. However, for some patients, a significant portion of the total HRP2 was in immune-complexed form. Future studies investigating the prevalence and proportion of immune-complexed HRP2 in asymptomatic individuals with low HRP2 levels will be required to assess whether alpha-HRP2 antibodies affect HRP2 detection for this portion of the transmission reservoir.

TI Evaluation of loop-mediated isothermal amplification as a surveillance
   tool for malaria in reactive case detection moving towards elimination
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: As malaria transmission decreases, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic at any given time increases. This poses a challenge for diagnosis as routinely used rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) miss asymptomatic malaria cases with low parasite densities due to poor sensitivity. Yet, asymptomatic infections can contribute to onward transmission of malaria and therefore act as infectious reservoirs and perpetuate malaria transmission. This study compared the performance of RDTs to loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in the diagnosis of malaria during reactive active case detection surveillance.
   Methods: All reported malaria cases in the Engela Health District of Namibia were traced back to their place of residence and persons living within the four closest neighbouring houses to the index case (neighbourhood) were tested for malaria infection with RDTs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected. LAMP and nested PCR (nPCR) were carried out on all RDTs and DBS. The same procedure was followed in randomly selected control neighbourhoods.
   Results: Some 3151 individuals were tested by RDT, LAMP and nPCR. Sensitivity of RDTs and LAMP were 9.30 and 95.50%, respectively, and specificities were 99.27 and 99.92%, respectively, compared to nPCR. LAMP carried out on collected RDTs showed a sensitivity and specificity of 95.35 and 99.85% compared to nPCR carried out on DBS. There were 2 RDT samples that were negative by LAMP but the corresponding DBS samples were positive by PCR.
   Conclusion: The study showed that LAMP had the equivalent performance as nPCR for the identification of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Given its relative simplicity to implement over more complex and time-consuming methods, such as PCR, LAMP is particularly useful in elimination settings where high sensitivity and ease of operation are important.

TI High efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and
   dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated
   falciparum malaria in Muheza and Kigoma Districts, Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the recommended first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in most of the malaria-endemic countries, including Tanzania. Recently, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has been recommended as the alternative anti-malarial to ensure effective case management in Tanzania. This study assessed the parasite clearance rate and efficacy of AL and DP among patients aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in two sites with different malaria transmission intensity.
   Methods: This was an open-label, randomized trial that was conducted at two sites of Muheza Designated District Hospital and Ujiji Health Centre in Tanga and Kigoma regions, respectively. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled, treated with either AL or DP and followed up for 28 (extended to 42) and 42 (63) days for AL and DP, respectively. Parasite clearance time was monitored in the first 72 h post treatment and the clearance rate constant and half-life were calculated using an established parasite clearance estimator. The primary outcome was parasitological cure on days 28 and 42 for AL and DP, respectively, while secondary outcome was extended parasitological cure on days 42 and 63 for AL and DP, respectively.
   Results: Of the 509 children enrolled (192 at Muheza and 317 at Ujiji), there was no early treatment failure and PCR uncorrected cure rates on day 28 in the AL group were 77.2 and 71.2% at Muheza and Ujiji, respectively. In the DP arm, the PCR uncorrected cure rate on day 42 was 73.6% at Muheza and 72.5% at Ujiji. With extended follow-up (to day 42 for AL and 63 for DP) cure rates were lower at Ujiji compared to Muheza (AL: 60.2 and 46.1%, p = 0.063; DP: 57.6 and 40.3% in Muheza and Ujiji, respectively, p = 0.021). The PCR corrected cure rate ranged from 94.6 to 100% for all the treatment groups at both sites. Parasite clearance rate constant was similar in the two groups and at both sites (< 0.28/h); the slope half-life was < 3.0 h and all but only one patient cleared parasites by 72 h.
   Conclusion: These findings confirm high efficacy of the first-and the newly recommended alternative ACT for treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Tanzania. The high parasite clearance rate suggests absence of suspected artemisinin resistance, defined as delayed parasite clearance.

TI Effectiveness and safety of 3 and 5 day courses of
   artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
   malaria in an area of emerging artemisinin resistance in Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has emerged and spread in Southeast Asia. In areas where resistance is established longer courses of artemisinin-based combination therapy have improved cure rates.
   Methods: The standard 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was compared with an extended 5-day regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Kayin state in South-East Myanmar, an area of emerging artemisinin resistance. Late parasite clearance dynamics were described by microscopy and quantitative ultrasensitive PCR. Patients were followed up for 42 days.
   Results: Of 154 patients recruited (105 adults and 49 children < 14 years) 78 were randomized to 3 days and 76 to 5 days AL. Mutations in the P. falciparum kelch13 propeller gene (k13) were found in 46% (70/152) of infections, with F446I the most prevalent propeller mutation (29%; 20/70). Both regimens were well-tolerated. Parasite clearance profiles were biphasic with a slower submicroscopic phase which was similar in k13 wild-type and mutant infections. The cure rates were 100% (70/70) and 97% (68/70) in the 3- and 5-day arms respectively. Genotyping of the two recurrences was unsuccessful.
   Conclusion: Despite a high prevalence of k13 mutations, the current first-line treatment, AL, was still highly effective in this area of South-East Myanmar. The extended 5 day regimen was very well tolerated, and would be an option to prolong the useful therapeutic life of AL.

TI Field evaluation of a real time loop-mediated isothermal amplification
   assay (RealAmp) for malaria diagnosis in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
AB Conventional molecular methods, such as nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are very sensitive for detection of malaria parasites, but require advanced laboratory equipment and trained personnel. Real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp), a loop- mediated isothermal amplification-based molecular tool (LAMP), facilitates rapid target amplification at a single temperature setting, reducing the need for sophisticated equipment. We evaluated the performance of a field-adapted RealAmp assay for malaria diagnosis in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre State, Brazil, a remote area in Brazil with limited laboratory capabilities. We enrolled 1,000 patients with fever (axillary temperature >= 37.5 C) or history of fever in last 24 h presenting for malaria diagnosis from February through June 2015. DNA was extracted from dried blood spots using a boil and spin method (heat treatment) at the sample processing site, and also using commercial kits at a Brazilian national reference laboratory. RealAmp was performed for Plasmodium genus, P. falciparum, and P. vivax identification. In addition, Giemsa-stained blood smears were prepared and examined by two independent well-trained study microscopists. A combination of Real-time PCR and nested PCR was used as reference test. The sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in the field site laboratory were 94.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.1-96.8) and 83.9% (95% CI: 81.1-86.4), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of local microscopy were 87.7% (95% CI: 82.6-91.7) and 98.9% (95% CI: 97.8-99.4), respectively, while study microscopy showed sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI: 93.0-98.4) and specificity of 98.2% (95% CI: 97.0-99.0). None of the three tests detected 20 P. falciparum and P. vivax mixed infections identified by the reference test. Our findings highlight that it is possible to implement simple molecular tests in facilities with limited resources such as Cruzeiro do Sul in Brazil. RealAmp sensitivity was similar to that of microscopy performed by skilled professionals; both RealAmp and study microscopy performed poorly in detection of mixed infection. Attempts to develop and evaluate simpler molecular tools should continue, especially for the detection of malaria infection in remote areas.

TI Diagnostic accuracy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for
   screening malaria in peripheral and placental blood samples from
   pregnant women in Colombia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Pregnant women frequently show low-density Plasmodium infections that require more sensitive methods for accurate diagnosis and early treatment of malaria. This is particularly relevant in low-malaria transmission areas, where intermittent preventive treatment is not recommended. Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive, but require sophisticated equipment and advanced training. Instead, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides an opportunity for molecular detection of malaria infections in remote endemic areas, outside a reference laboratory. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of LAMP for the screening of malaria in pregnant women in Colombia.
   Methods: This is a nested prospective study that uses data and samples from a larger cross-sectional project conducted from May 2016 to January 2017 in three Colombian endemic areas (El Bagre, Quibdo, and Tumaco). A total of 531 peripheral and placental samples from pregnant women self-presenting at local hospitals for antenatal care visits, at delivery or seeking medical care for suspected malaria were collected. Samples were analysed for Plasmodium parasites by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and LAMP. Diagnostic accuracy endpoints (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa scores) of LM, RDT and LAMP were compared with nested PCR (nPCR) as the reference standard.
   Results: In peripheral samples, LAMP showed an improved sensitivity (100.0%) when compared with LM 79.5% and RDT 76.9% (p <0.01), particularly in afebrile women, for which LAMP sensitivity was two-times higher than LM and RDT. Overall agreement among LAMP and nPCR was high (kappa value= 1.0). Specificity was similar in all tests (100%). In placental blood, LAMP evidenced a four-fold improvement in sensitivity (88.9%) when compared with LM and RDT (22.2%), being the only method, together with nPCR, able to detect placental infections in peripheral blood.
   Conclusions: LAMP is a simple, rapid and accurate molecular tool for detecting gestational and placental malaria, being able to overcome the limited sensitivity of LM and RDT. These findings could guide maternal health programs in low-transmission settings to integrate LAMP in their surveillance systems for the active detection of low-density infections and asymptomatic malaria cases.

TI A Systematic Review: Performance of Rapid Diagnostic Tests for the
   Detection of Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium
   ovale Monoinfections in Human Blood
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Despite the increased use and worldwide distribution of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that distinguish between Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum species, little is known about their performance detecting Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk), Plasmodium malariae (Pm), and Plasmodium ovale (Po). This review seeks to analyze the results of published studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of malaria RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections.
   Methods. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched to identify studies that reported the performance of RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections.
   Results. Among 40 studies included in the review, 3 reported on Pk, 8 on Pm, 5 on Po, 1 on Pk and Pm, and 23 on Pm and Po infections. In the meta-analysis, estimates of sensitivities of RDTs in detecting Pk infections ranged 2%-48%. Test performances for Pm and Po infections were less accurate and highly heterogeneous, mainly because of the small number of samples tested.
   Conclusions. Limited data available suggest that malaria RDTs show suboptimal performance for detecting Pk, Pm, and Po infections. New improved RDTs and appropriately designed cross-sectional studies to demonstrate the usefulness of RDTs in the detection of neglected Plasmodium species are urgently needed.

TI A novel recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the rapid
   isothermal detection of Neospora caninum in aborted bovine fetuses
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB The development of a method to rapidly diagnose Neospora caninum infection is highly desirable. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combined with lateral flow (LF) strips, is a novel approach to rapidly amplify and visualize DNA. We have developed a prototype LF-RPA assay, using primers and a probe that targeted a specific sequence in the N. caninum NC-5 gene. The N. caninum-specific LF-RPA assay was first tested on purified DNA from oocysts and amplified N. caninum DNA to detectable levels in 10 min, at a constant temperature and without the need for an expensive thermocycler. The designed RPA primers and probe displayed 100% specificity for detecting N. caninum without any cross-reaction with DNA from nine related protozoan spp. (eg Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis gigantean, Sarcocystis zuoi, Hanunondia hammondi, Hammondia heydorni, Eimeria cylindrica, Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria annulata and Babesia bigemina). Although, LF-RPA assay detected amounts as low as 50 fg of N. caninum DNA, it was nearly 5-fold less sensitive than previously published qPCR and nested PCR assays. We tested the diagnostic performance of the LF-RPA assay for the detection of N. caninum DNA in aborted bovine fetal tissue samples, and compared the results with those obtained from nested PCR. Out of the 75 samples examined, 18 (24%) and 17 (22.6%) tested positive using LF-RPA and nested PCR, respectively. Our results indicate that LF-RPA is a suitable assay for the rapid and reliable detection of N. caninum.

TI Genetic polymorphisms in the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium
   malariae show a geographical bias
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium malariae is characterized by its long asymptomatic persistence in the human host. The epidemiology of P. malariae is incompletely understood and is hampered by the limited knowledge of genetic polymorphisms. Previous reports from Africa have shown heterogeneity within the P. malariae circumsporozoite protein (pmcsp) gene. However, comparative studies from Asian countries are lacking. Here, the genetic polymorphisms in pmcsp of Asian isolates have been characterized.
   Methods: Blood samples from 89 symptomatic P. malariae-infected patients were collected, from Thailand (n = 43), Myanmar (n = 40), Lao PDR (n = 5), and Bangladesh (n = 1). pmcsp was amplified using semi-nested PCR before sequencing. The resulting 89 pmcsp sequences were analysed together with 58 previously published pmcsp sequences representing African countries using BioEdit, MEGA6, and DnaSP.
   Results: Polymorphisms identified in pmcsp were grouped into 3 populations: Thailand, Myanmar, and Kenya. The nucleotide diversity and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in Thailand and Myanmar were higher compared with that in Kenya. Phylogenetic analysis showed clustering of pmcsp sequences according to the origin of isolates (Asia vs. Africa). High genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.404) was observed between P. malariae isolates from Asian and African countries. Sequence analysis of pmcsp showed the presence of tetrapeptide repeat units of NAAG, NDAG, and NAPG in the central repeat region of the gene. Plasmodium malariae isolates from Asian countries carried fewer copies of NAAG compared with that from African countries. The NAPG repeat was only observed in Asian isolates. Additional analysis of 2 T-cell epitopes, Th2R and Th3R, showed limited heterogeneity in P. malariae populations.
   Conclusions: This study provides valuable information on the genetic polymorphisms in pmcsp isolates from Asia and advances our understanding of P. malariae population in Asia and Africa. Polymorphisms in the central repeat region of pmcsp showed association with the geographical origin of P. malariae isolates and can be potentially used as a marker for genetic epidemiology of P. malariae population.

TI Clinical management of respiratory syndrome in patients hospitalized for
   suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the
   Paris area from 2013 to 2016
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Patients with suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection should be hospitalized in isolation wards to avoid transmission. This suspicion can also lead to medical confusion and inappropriate management of acute respiratory syndrome due to causes other than MERS-CoV.
   Methods: We studied the characteristics and outcome of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection in the isolation wards of two referral infectious disease departments in the Paris area between January 2013 and December 2016.
   Results: Of 93 adult patients (49 male (52.6%), median age 63.4 years) hospitalized, 82 out of 93 adult patients had returned from Saudi Arabia, and 74 of them were pilgrims (Hajj). Chest X-ray findings were abnormal in 72 (77%) patients. The 93 patients were negative for MERS-CoV RT-PCR, and 70 (75.2%) patients had documented infection, 47 (50.5%) viral, 22 (23.6%) bacterial and one Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microbiological analysis identified Rhinovirus (27.9%), Influenza virus (26.8%), Legionella pneumophila (7.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5%), and non-MERS-coronavirus (6.4%). Antibiotics were initiated in 81 (87%) cases, with two antibiotics in 63 patients (67.7%). The median duration of hospitalization and isolation was 3 days (1-33) and 24 h (8-92), respectively. Time of isolation decreased over time (P < 0.01). Two patients (2%) died.
   Conclusion: The management of patients with possible MERS-CoV infection requires medical facilities with trained personnel, and rapid access to virological results. Empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and an association of antibiotics effective against S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila are the cornerstones of the management of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection.

TI Plasmodium 18S rRNA of intravenously administered sporozoites does not
   persist in peripheral blood
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium 18S rRNA is a biomarker used to monitor blood-stage infections in malaria clinical trials. Plasmodium sporozoites also express this biomarker, and there is conflicting evidence about how long sporozoitederived 18S rRNA persists in peripheral blood. If present in blood for an extended timeframe, sporozoite-derived 18S rRNA could complicate use as a blood-stage biomarker.
   Methods: Blood samples from Plasmodium yoelii infected mice were tested for Plasmodium 18S rRNA and their coding genes (rDNA) using sensitive quantitative reverse transcription PCR and quantitative PCR assays, respectively. Blood and tissues from Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ)-infected rhesus macaques were similarly tested.
   Results: In mice, when P. yoelii sporozoite inoculation and blood collection were performed at the same site (tail vein), low level rDNA positivity persisted for 2 days post-infection. Compared to intact parasites with high rRNAto- rDNA ratios, this low level positivity was accompanied by no increase in rRNA-to-rDNA, indicating detection of residual, non-viable parasite rDNA. When P. yoelii sporozoites were administered via the retro-orbital vein and blood sampled by cardiac puncture, neither P. yoelii 18S rRNA nor rDNA were detected 24 h post-infection. Similarly, there was no P. falciparum 18S rRNA detected in blood of rhesus macaques 3 days after intravenous injection with extremely high doses of PfSPZ. Plasmodium 18S rRNA in the rhesus livers increased by approximately 101-fold from 3 to 6 days post infection, indicating liver-stage proliferation.
   Conclusions: Beyond the first few hours after injection, sporozoite-derived Plasmodium 18S rRNA was not detected in peripheral blood. Diagnostics based on 18S rRNA are unlikely to be confounded by sporozoite inocula in human clinical trials.

TI Tropical diseases in the ICU: A syndromic approach to diagnosis and
   treatment
SO JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB Tropical infections form 20-30% of ICU admissions in tropical countries. Diarrheal diseases, malaria, dengue, typhoid, rickettsial diseases and leptospirosis are common causes of critical illness. Overlapping clinical features makes initial diagnosis challenging. A systematic approach involving (1) history of specific continent or country of travel, (2) exposure to specific environments (forests or farms, water sports, consumption of exotic foods), (3) incubation period, and (4) pattern of organ involvement and subtle differences in manifestations help in differential diagnosis and choice of initial empiric therapy. Fever, rash, hypotension, thrombocytopenia and mild derangement of liver function tests is seen in a majority of patients. Organ failure may lead to shock, respiratory distress, renal failure, hepatitis, coma, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias or hemorrhage. Diagnosis in some conditions is made by peripheral blood smear examination, antigen detection or detection of microbial nucleic acid by PCR. Tests that detect specific IgM antibody become positive only in the second week of illness. Initial therapy is often empiric; a combination of intravenous artesunate, ceftriaxone and either doxycycline or azithromycin would cover a majority of the treatable syndromes. Additional antiviral or antiprotozoal medications are required for some specific syndromes. Involving a physician specializing in tropical or travel medicine is helpful. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI Antimalarial activity of single-dose DSM265, a novel plasmodium
   dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, in patients with uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria infection: a
   proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2a study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background DSM265 is a novel, long-duration inhibitor of plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with excellent selectivity over human DHODH and activity against blood and liver stages of Plasmodium falciparum. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of DSM265 in patients with P falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria infection.
   Methods This proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2a study was conducted at the Asociacion Civil Selva Amazonica in Iquitos, Peru. Patients aged 18-70 years, weighing 45-90 kg, who had clinical malaria (P falciparum or P vivax monoinfection) and fever within the previous 24 h were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical or laboratory signs of severe malaria, inability to take oral medicine, and use of other antimalarial treatment in the preceding 14 days. Patients were divided into cohorts of those with P falciparum (cohort a) or P vivax (cohort b) infection. Two initial cohorts received single oral doses of 400 mg DSM265. Patients were followed up for efficacy for 28 days and safety for 35 days. Further cohorts received escalated or de-escalated doses of DSM265, after safety and efficacy assessment of the initial dose. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) by day 14 for patients infected with P falciparum and the proportion of patients achieving a crude cure by day 14 for those infected with P vivax. Cohort success, the criteria for dose escalation, was defined as ACPR (P falciparum) or crude cure (P vivax) in at least 80% of patients in the cohort. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population (ITT) and the per-protocol population, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received the study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02123290).
   Findings Between Jan 12, 2015, and Dec 2, 2015, 45 Peruvian patients (24 with P falciparum [cohort a] and 21 with P vivax [cohort b] infection) were sequentially enrolled. For patients with P falciparum malaria in the per-protocol population, all 11 (100%) in the 400 mg group and eight (80%) of ten in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR on day 14. In the ITT analysis, 11 (85%) of 13 in the 400 mg group and eight (73%) of 11 in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR at day 14. For the patients with P vivax malaria, the primary endpoint was not met. In the per-protocol analysis, none of four patients who had 400 mg, three (50%) of six who had 600 mg, and one (25%) of four who had 800 mg DSM265 achieved crude cure at day 14. In the ITT analysis, none of five in the 400 mg group, three (33%) of nine in the 600 mg group, and one (14%) of seven in the 800 mg group achieved crude cure at day 14. During the 28-day extended observation of P falciparum patients, a resistance-associated mutation in the gene encoding the DSM265 target DHODH was observed in two of four recurring patients. DSM265 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pyrexia (20 [44%] of 45) and headache (18 [40%] of 45), which are both common symptoms of malaria, and no patients had any treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation.
   Interpretation After a single dose of DSM265, P falciparum parasitaemia was rapidly cleared, whereas against P vivax, DSM265 showed less effective clearance kinetics. Its long duration of action provides the potential to prevent recurrence of P falciparum after treatment with a single dose, which should be further assessed in future combination studies.

TI Avian malaria co-infections confound infectivity and vector competence
   assays of Plasmodium homopolare
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Currently, there are very few studies of avian malaria that investigate relationships among the host-vector-parasite triad concomitantly. In the current study, we experimentally measured the vector competence of several Culex mosquitoes for a newly described avian malaria parasite, Plasmodium homopolare. Song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) blood infected with a low P. homopolare parasitemia was inoculated into a na < ve domestic canary (Serinus canaria forma domestica). Within 5 to 10 days post infection (dpi), the canary unexpectedly developed a simultaneous high parasitemic infection of Plasmodium cathemerium (Pcat6) and a low parasitemic infection of P. homopolare, both of which were detected in blood smears. During this infection period, PCR detected Pcat6, but not P. homopolare in the canary. Between 10 and 60 dpi, Pcat6 blood stages were no longer visible and PCR no longer amplified Pcat6 parasite DNA from canary blood. However, P. homopolare blood stages remained visible, albeit still at very low parasitemias, and PCR was able to amplify P. homopolare DNA. This pattern of mixed Pcat6 and P. homopolare infection was repeated in three secondary infected canaries that were injected with blood from the first infected canary. Mosquitoes that blood-fed on the secondary infected canaries developed infections with Pcat6 as well as another P. cathemerium lineage (Pcat8); none developed PCR detectable P. homopolare infections. These observations suggest that the original P. homopolare-infected songbird also had two un-detectable P. cathemerium lineages/strains. The vector and host infectivity trials in this study demonstrated that current molecular assays may significantly underreport the extent of mixed avian malaria infections in vectors and hosts.

TI Photo-Induced Electron Transfer Real-Time PCR for Detection of
   Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin 2 Gene Copy Number
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Piperaquine is an important partner drug used in artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). An increase in the plasmepsin 2 and 3 gene copy numbers has been associated with decreased susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to piperaquine in Cambodia. Here, we developed a photo-induced electron transfer real-time KR (PET-PCR) assay to quantify the copy number of the P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 gene (PfPM2) that can be used in countries where P. falciparum is endemic to enhance molecular surveillance.

TI Genomics and molecular epidemiology of Cryptosporidium species
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Cryptosporidium is one of the most widespread protozoan parasites that infects domestic and wild animals and is considered the second major cause of diarrhea and death in children after rotavirus. So far, around 20 distinct species are known to cause severe to moderate infections in humans, of which Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are the major causative agents. Currently, ssurRNA and gp60 are used as the optimal markers for differentiating species and subtypes respectively. Over the last decade, diagnostic tools to detect and differentiate Cryptosporidium species at the genotype and subtype level have improved, but our understanding of the zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission potential of each species is less clear, largely because of the paucity of high resolution whole genome sequencing data for the different species. Defining which species possess an anthroponotic vs. zoonotic transmission cycle is critical if we are to limit the spread of disease between animals and humans. Likewise, it is unclear to what extent genetic hybridization impacts disease potential or the emergence of outbreak strains. The development of high resolution genetic markers and whole genome sequencing of different species should provide new insights into these knowledge gaps. The aim of this review is to outline currently available molecular epidemiology and genomics data for different species of Cryptosporidium.

TI Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of Escherichia coli involved in
   transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections: implications for
   preventive strategies
SO TRANSFUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBIs) are the main residual infectious complications of transfusions. Escherichia coli and platelet (PLT) concentrates may be epidemiologically associated, leading to severe, if not lethal, TTBIs. We investigated the genotypic and phenotypic reasons for this clinically deleterious combination. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Weinvestigated a French national E. coli strain collection related to six independent episodes of TTBIs. Their phenotypic characterizations included antibiotic susceptibility testing, growth testing under different culture conditions, serum survival assays, and virulence in a sepsis mousemodel. Their genotypic characterizations included polymerase chain reaction phylotyping, whole genome sequencing, and a subsequent in silico analysis. RESULTS: We highlighted a selection process of highly extraintestinal virulent strains, mainly belonging to the B2 phylogroup, adapted to the hostile environment (high citrate concentration and a bactericidal serum effect) of apheresiscollected platelet concentrates (PCs). Compared to controls, the E. coli TTBI strains grew faster in the PCs due to a superior ability to capture iron. The in vitro growth performances were highly compatible with blood-derived product real-life conditions, including storage conditions and delays. The consistent serum resistance of TTBI strains promotes their survival in both the donor's and the receiver's blood and in the PCs. CONCLUSION: This study pointed out that E. coli strains responsible for TTBI exhibit very specific traits. They belong to the extraintestinal pathogenic phylogroups and have a high intrinsic virulence. They can be resistant to complement, capture iron, and grow in the apheresiscollected PCs. These findings therefore support the reinforcement of the postdonation information.
