TI Role of genetic factors and ethnicity on the multiplicity of Plasmodium
   falciparum infection in children with asymptomatic malaria in Yaounde,
   Cameroon
SO HELIYON
AB In this cross-sectional study, we investigated host genetic factors and ethnic variation in circulating Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2) clones among children with asymptomatic malaria.
   Isolates from seventy two asymptomatic malaria children were used for genotyping block 3 of msp-2 gene by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sickle cell trait and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism of DNA products from PCR targeting codons 6 and 68 of the beta-globin (HBB) and G6PD genes respectively. ABO blood group was typed by agglutination method.
   A total of forty two msp-2 genotypes (20 for 3D7 and 22 for FC27) were detected for an average (standard error of mean) multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.45 (0.16). The MOI was statistically the same among the five identified ethnic groups (P = 0.83). The overall prevalence of sickle cell trait and G6PD deficiency were 12.50 % and 22.22 % respectively. MOI was similar between children with Hb AA and Hb AS genotypes (P = 0.42). MOI was significantly high among children with a mutant G6PD genotype (P = 0.017). MOI was significantly higher in blood group O than group A (P = 0.03).
   Our findings show that although ethnicity and sickle cell trait have no association with MOI, the association was observed with G6PD genotype and ABO group. The results suggest the need for extension and expansion of the current study in order to investigate the mechanisms involved.

TI Performance of a highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (HS-RDT) for
   detecting malaria in peripheral and placental blood samples from
   pregnant women in Colombia
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Pregnancy poses specific challenges for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection due to parasite sequestration in the placenta, which translates in low circulation levels in peripheral blood. The aim of this study is to assess the performance of a new highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (HS-RDT) for the detection of malaria in peripheral and placental blood samples from pregnant women in Colombia.
   Methods
   This is a retrospective study using 737 peripheral and placental specimens collected from pregnant women in Colombian malaria-endemic regions. Light microscopy (LM), conventional rapid diagnostic tests (Pf/Pv RDT and Pf RDT), and HS-RDT testing were performed. Diagnostic accuracy endpoints of LM, HS-RDT and RDTs were compared with nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) as the reference test.
   Results
   In comparison with nPCR, the sensitivity of HS-RDT, Pf RDT, Pf/Pv RDT and LM to detect infection in peripheral samples was 85.7% (95% CI = 70.6-93.7), 82.8% (95% CI = 67.391.9), 77.1 % (95% CI = 61.0-87.9) and 77.1 % (95% CI = 61.0-87.9) respectively. The sensitivity to detect malaria in asymptomatic women, was higher with HS-RDT, where LM and Pf/Pv RDT missed half of infections detected by nPCR, but differences were not significant. Overall, specificity was similar for all tests (>99.0%). In placental blood, the prevalence of infection by P. falciparum by nPCR was 2.8% (8/286), by HS-RDT was 1 % and by conventional RDTs (Pf RDT and Pf/Pv RDT) and LM was 0.7%. The HS-RDT detected placental infections in peripheral blood that were negative by LM and Pf/Pv RDT, however the number of positive placentas was low.
   Conclusions
   The sensitivity of HS-RDT to detect P. falciparum infections in peripheral and placental samples from pregnant women was slightly better compared to routinely used tests during ANC visits and at delivery. Although further studies are needed to guide recommendations on the use of the HS-RDT for malaria case management in pregnancy, this study shows the potential value of this test to diagnose malaria in pregnancy in low-transmission settings.

TI Efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine in the treatment of falciparum
   uncomplicated malaria in Madagascar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Since 2006, the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are recommended to treat uncomplicated malaria including non Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Madagascar. Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine are the first-and second-line treatment in uncomplicated falciparum malaria, respectively. No clinical drug efficacy study has been published since 2009 to assess the efficacy of these two artemisinin-based combinations in Madagascar, although the incidence of malaria cases has increased from 2010 to 2016. In this context, new data about the efficacy of the drug combinations currently used to treat malaria are needed.
   Methods: Therapeutic efficacy studies evaluating the efficacy of ASAQ were conducted in 2012, 2013 and 2016 among falciparum malaria-infected patients aged between 6 months and 56 years, in health centres in 6 sites representing different epidemiological patterns. The 2009 World Health Organization protocol for monitoring anti-malarial drug efficacy was followed.
   Results: A total of 348 enrolled patients met the inclusion criteria including 108 patients in 2012 (n = 64 for Matanga, n = 44 for Ampasipotsy), 123 patients in 2013 (n = 63 for Ankazomborona, n = 60 for Anjoma Ramartina) and 117 patients in 2016 (n = 67 for Tsaratanana, n = 50 for Antanimbary). The overall cumulative PCR-corrected day 28 cure rate was 99.70% (95% IC 98.30-99.95). No significant difference in cure rates was observed overtime: 99.02% (95% IC 94.65-99.83) in 2012; 100% (95% IC 96.8-100) in 2013 and 100% (95% IC 96.65-100) in 2016.
   Conclusion: The ASAQ combination remains highly effective for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Madagascar.

TI Genetic diversity of merozoite surface ID protein-1 C-terminal 42 kDa of
   Plasmodium falciparum (PfMSP-1(42)) may be greater than previously known
   in global isolates
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The C-terminal 42 kDa region of merozoite surface protein-1 of Plasmodium falciparum (PfMSP-1(42)) is the target of an immune response. It has been recognised as one of the promising candidate antigens for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. Genetic structure of PfMSP-1(42) has been considered to be largely conserved in the P. falciparum population. However, only limited information is currently available. This study aimed to analyse genetic diversity and the effect of natural selection on PfMSP-1(42) among the Myanmar P. falciparum population and compare them with publicly available PfMSP-1(42) from global P. falciparum populations.
   Methods: A total of 69 P. falciparum clinical isolates collected from Myanmar malaria patients in Upper Myanmar in 2015 were used. The PfMSP-1(42) region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. Genetic structure and natural selection of this region were analysed using MEGA4 and DnaSP programs. Polymorphic nature and natural selection in global PfMSP-1(42) were also investigated.
   Results: All three allele types (MAD20, K1, and R033) of PfMSP-1 42 were identified in Myanmar isolates of P. falciparum. Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) displayed genetic diversity. Most polymorphisms were scattered in blocks 16 and 17. Polymorphisms observed in Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) showed a similar pattern to those of global PfMSP1(42); however, they were not identical to each other. Genetic diversity of Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) was relatively lower than that of PfMSP-1(42) from different geographical regions. Evidence of natural selection and recombination were found. Comparative analysis of genetic polymorphism and natural selection in the global PfMSP-1(42) population suggested that this region was not tightly conserved in global PfMSP-1(42) as previously thought and is under the complicated influence of natural selection and recombination.
   Conclusions: Global PfMSP-1(42) revealed limited, but non-negligible, genetic diversity by allele types and geographical origins. Complicated natural selection and potential recombination might have occurred in global PfMSP-1(42). Comprehensive monitoring of genetic diversity for global PfMSP-1(42) would be needed to better understand the polymorphic nature and evolutionary aspect of PfMSP-1(42 )in the global P. falciparum population. More thought would be necessary for designing a vaccine based on PfMSP-1(42).

TI Imported and autochthonous malaria in West Saudi Arabia: results from a
   reference hospital
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seeking malaria eradication. Malaria transmission has been very low over the last few years. Discovered cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection are assigned a treatment protocol of artemisinin-zbased combination therapy, which consists of artesunate in addition to sulfadoxine-zpyrimethamine rather than the traditional chloroquine, which has high resistance rates worldwide. This study aims to investigate the presence of different gene mutations concerning anti-zmalarial drug resistance (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt, pfcytb, pfketch13) to identify whether drug-zresistant alleles are present in this area of the Kingdom and whether the country's treatment protocol is still suitable for Plasmodium bearing a resistance mutation.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from patients suffering from symptoms suggesting malaria coming to King Faisal Hospital, Taif, from February to August 2016. Diagnosis was performed by Giemsa-zstained thin and thick blood films, rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Positive P. falciparum samples were further subjected to series of PCR amplification reactions targeting genes related with drug resistance (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt, pfcytb, pfketch13).
   Results: Twenty-zsix cases were positives, 13 infected with P. falciparum, of those, 4 cases were autochthonous, and 13 with Plasmodium vivax. The results of the gene mutation detection confirmed that there was no mutation related to resistance to artemisinin or atovaquone, on the other hand chloroquine resistance alleles were detected in 31% of samples. Moreover, point mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes, related resistance to antifolate drugs, were detected in all characterized samples.
   Conclusions: Haplotypes of P. falciparum in the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia exhibit high resistance against antifolate drugs. These results should be extensively discussed when planning to modify anti-zmalarial drug protocols in the future.

TI A barcode of multilocus nuclear DNA identifies genetic relatedness in
   pre- and post-Artemether/Lumefantrine treated Plasmodium falciparum in
   Nigeria
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: The decline in the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) in some endemic regions threatens the progress towards global elimination of malaria. Molecular surveillance of drug resistance in malaria-endemic regions is vital to detect the emergence and spread of mutant strains.
   Methods: We observed 89 malaria patients for the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections in Lagos, Nigeria and determined the prevalence of drug resistant strains in the population. Parasite clearance rates were determined by microscopy and the highly sensitive var gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS) polymerase chain reaction for 65 patients with samples on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after commencement of treatment. The genomic finger print of parasite DNA from pre- and post-treatment samples were determined using 24 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) barcode for P. falciparum. Drug resistance associated alleles in chloroquine resistance transporter gene (crt-76), multidrug resistance genes (mdr1-86 and mdr1-184), dihydropteroate synthase (dhps-540), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr-108) and kelch domain (K-13580) were genotyped by high resolution melt analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments.
   Results: By varATS qPCR, 12 (18.5%) of the participants had detectable parasite DNA in their blood three days after treatment, while eight (12.3%) individuals presented with genotypable day 28 parasitaemia. Complexity of infection (Col) was 1.30 on day 0 and 1.34 on day 28, the mean expected heterozygosity (H-E) values across all barcodes were 0.50 +/- 0.05 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 on days 0 and 28 respectively. Barcode (pi) pairwise comparisons showed high genetic relatedness of day 0 and day 28 parasite isolates in three (37.5%) of the eight individuals who presented with reappearing infections. Crt-76 mutant allele was present in 38 (58.5%) isolates. The mdr1-86 mutant allele was found in 56 (86.2%) isolates. No mutation in the K-13580 was observed.
   Conclusions: Persistence of DNA-detectable parasitaemia in more than 18% of cases after treatment and indications of genetic relatedness between pre- and post-treatment infections warrants further investigation of a larger population for signs of reduced ACT efficacy in Nigeria.

TI Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Nepal
SO TROPICAL DISEASES TRAVEL MEDICINE AND VACCINES
AB BackgroundThe national treatment guidelines of Nepal have adopted Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2004. Emergence of Artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) and beyond may become a threat for Nepal as well. The main objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drug artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated P. falciparum infected patients at health centers/hospitals treated over the period of 2 years (2013-2014).MethodsGiemsa stained thick and thin smears, prepared from uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients who visited the selected sentinel sites in Nepal during 2013 to 2014 and met the inclusion criteria that included parasitemia (1000-10,000 /mu L of blood), were evaluated until 28 days after ACTs treatment, following a World Health Organization (WHO) therapeutic efficacy protocol. Based on the re-occurrence of fever and resurge in parasitemia, the study patients were classified as resistant or susceptible. Blood specimens on filter papers were further analyzed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), specifically for the K13 propeller gene mutation (a recently identified molecular marker for ACT resistance).ResultsA total of 56,013 suspected malaria cases were screened for this study. Of which, 120 (0.21%) were infected with falciparum malaria. Out of 120, 28 cases of P. falciparum (28/120; 23.33%) were enrolled in the study, of which 24 cases completed the post-treatment follow up for 28 days. Only one case out of 24 (4%) was identified as a late treatment failure (LTF). K13 mutation, a proxy indicator for ACT resistance in parasites, was not detected on the day 1, which indicates resistance had not yet reached the molecular level.ConclusionOnly one case of late treatment failure was identified in this study. ACT combination using artemether-lumefantrine was still effective for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nepal. A close monitoring and supervision for ACT resistance is essential for future malaria treatment in Nepal.

TI Different Erythrocyte MicroRNA Profiles in Low- and High-Altitude
   Individuals
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Background: The number of red blood cells (RBCs) increases significantly in response to high-altitude hypoxic environments, and the RBC microRNA (miRNA) expression pattern is similar to that in whole blood. Studies have shown that miRNA in plasma can act as a circulating hypoxia-associated marker, but the effect of a high-altitude hypoxic environment on RBC-derived miRNAs has not yet been reported.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 20 Han Chinese individuals residing at 500m (Sichuan Han), 10 migrant Han Chinese citizens residing at 3,658m (Tibet Han) and 12 native Tibetans, and RBC indices measurements and miRNA sequencing analyses were performed for the three sample groups. The levels of some markedly altered miRNAs at high altitude were subsequently measured from 5 randomly selected samples of each group by real-time PCR. Bioinformatic analyses was performed to determine the potential target genes of selected hypoxia-associated miRNAs.
   Results: Marked changes of several RBC indices were observed among the Tibet Han population, the Tibetan population and the Sichuan Han population. A total of 516 miRNAs derived from RBCs were initially identified by miRNA sequencing in the three sample groups. Compared with the Sichuan Han population, 49 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the Tibet Han population (17 upregulated and 32 downregulated). 12 upregulated and 21 downregulated miRNAs were observed in the Tibetan population compared with the Sichuan Han population. A total of 40 RBC miRNAs were differentially expressed in the Tibetan population (15 upregulated and 25 downregulated) compared with the Tibet Han population. Two significantly altered miRNAs with the highest expression levels (miRNA-144-5p and miR-30b-5p) were selected for real-time PCR analysis, and the results were consistent with those of miRNA sequencing. Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses showed that some potential target genes of miR-144-5p and miR-30b-5p are involved in the erythroid-hypoxia-, and nitric oxide (NO)-related signaling pathways in response to hypoxia.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide clear evidence, for the first time, that a high-altitude hypoxic environment significantly affects human RBC miRNA profiles.

TI Manifestation of malaria in Mangaluru, southern India
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Severe and fatal vivax malaria is increasingly reported from India. In Mangaluru, southern India, malaria is focused in urban areas and associated with importation by migrant workers. In Wenlock Hospital, the largest governmental hospital, the clinical, parasitological and biochemical characteristics of malaria patients were assessed.
   Methods: During the peak malaria season in 2015 (June to December), outpatients were interviewed and clinically assessed. Malaria was ascertained by microscopy and PCR assays, concentrations of haemoglobin, creatinine and bilirubin, as well as thrombocyte count, were determined, and severe malaria was defined according to WHO criteria.
   Results: Among 909 malaria patients, the vast majority was male (93%), adult (median, 26 years) and of low socioeconomic status. Roughly half of them were migrants from beyond the local Karnataka state, mostly from northern and northeastern states. Vivax malaria (69.6%) predominated over mixed Plasmodium vivax-Plasmodium falciparum infection (21.3%) and falciparum malaria (9.0%). The geometric mean parasite density was 3412/mu L. As compared to vivax malaria, patients with falciparum malaria had higher parasite density and more frequently showed impaired general condition, affected consciousness and splenomegaly. Also, they tended to more commonly have anaemia and increased creatinine levels, and to be hospitalized (7.3%). Mixed-species infections largely assumed an interim position. Severe malaria (3.5%) was not associated with parasite species. No fatality occurred.
   Conclusion: In this study, uncomplicated cases of malaria predominated, with P. falciparum causing slightly more intense manifestation. Severe malaria was infrequent and fatalities absent. This contrasts with the reported pattern of manifestation in other parts of India, which requires the analysis of underlying causes.

TI Study of the diagnostic accuracy of microbiological techniques in the
   diagnosis of malaria in the immigrant population in Madrid
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is currently the most important human parasitic disease in the world responsible for high morbidity and mortality. Appropriate diagnostic methods are essential for early detection. Microscopy examination remains the gold standard, although molecular techniques have higher sensitivity and are very useful in cases of low parasitaemia and mixed infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new commercial molecular diagnostic technique.
   Methods: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was performed between January 2015 and April 2017. All participants were immigrants from malaria-endemic areas, who were divided into two groups: asymptomatic group and symptomatic. Samples from both groups were evaluated by a rapid diagnostic test-(ImmunoQuick (R) Malaria + 4 RDT), microscopy examination, and two commercial molecular malaria tests (FTD Malaria and FTD Malaria Differentiation), then compared against an in-house reference PCR technique.
   Results: In all, 250 patients were included: 164 (65.6%) in the asymptomatic group, and 86 (34.4%) in the symptomatic group. There were seven cases of asymptomatic parasitaemia (prevalence = 2.8%) that were detected only by molecular methods. In the symptomatic group, there were seven cases of submicroscopic malaria. The main species detected was Plasmodium falciparum (96.6%). The commercial molecular technique had higher sensitivity than the other methods (S = 96%) and a high rate of concordance with the in-house reference PCR technique (Kappa score = 0.93).
   Conclusions: The molecular techniques, although slower than microscopy, have adequate diagnostic accuracy and are very useful for the detection of P. falciparum in cases with low parasitaemia.

TI Seasonal variations in Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity and
   multiplicity of infection in asymptomatic children living in southern
   Ghana
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) parasites is a major hurdle to the control of malaria. This study monitored changes in the genetic diversity and the multiplicity of P. falciparum parasite infection in asymptomatic children living in southern Ghana at 3 month intervals between April 2015 and January 2016.
   Methods: Filter paper blood spots (DBS) were collected quarterly from children living in Obom, a community with perennial malaria transmission and Abura, a community with seasonal malaria transmission. Genomic DNA was extracted from the DBS and used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping of the merozoite surface protein 1 (msp 1) and merozoite surface protein 2 (msp 2) genes.
   Results: Out of a total of 787 samples that were collected from the two study sites, 59.2% (466/787) tested positive for P. falciparum. The msp 1 and msp 2 genes were successfully amplified from 73.8% (344/466) and 82.5% (385/466) of the P. falciparum positive samples respectively. The geometric mean MOI in Abura ranged between 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.28) and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.36-1.60) and was significantly lower (p < 0.01, Dunn's multiple comparison test) than that determined in Obom, where the geometric mean MOI ranged between 1.82 (95% CI: 1.58-2.08) and 2.50 (95% CI: 2.33-2.678) over the study period. Whilst the msp 1 R033:MAD20:KI allelic family ratio was dynamic, the msp 2 3D7:FC27 allelic family ratio remained relatively stable across the changing seasons in both sites.
   Conclusions: This study shows that seasonal variations in parasite diversity in these communities can be better estimated by msp 1 rather than msp 2 due to the constantly changing relative intra allelic frequencies observed in msp 1 and the fact that the dominance of any msp 2 allele was dependent on the transmission setting but not on the season as opposed to the dominance of any msp 1 allele, which was dependent on both the season and the transmission setting.

TI Deletions of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes of Plasmodium falciparum from
   Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria remains a public health problem in some countries of Central America. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are one of the most useful tools to assist in the diagnosis of malaria in remote areas. Since its introduction, a wide variety of RDTs have been developed for the detection of different parasite antigens. PfHRP2 is the most targeted antigen for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Genetic mutations and gene deletions are important factors influencing or affecting the performance of rapid diagnostic tests.
   Methods: In order to demonstrate the presence or absence of the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes and their flanking regions, a total of 128 blood samples from patients with P. falciparum infection from three Central American countries were analysed through nested or semi-nested PCR approaches.
   Results: In total, 25.8 and 91.4% of the isolates lacked the region located between exon 1 and exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively. Parasites from the three countries showed deletions of one or both genes. The highest proportion of pfhrp2 deletions was found in Nicaragua while the isolates from Guatemala revealed the lowest number of pfhrp2 deletions. Parasites collected from Honduras showed the highest proportion of phfrp3 absence (96.2%). Twenty-one percent of isolates were double negative mutants for the exon 1-2 segment of both genes, and 6.3% of isolates lacked the full-length coding region of both genes.
   Conclusions: This study provides molecular evidence of the existence of P. falciparum isolates lacking the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, and their flanking regions, in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. This finding could hinder progress in the control and elimination of malaria in Central America. Continuous evaluation of RDTs and molecular surveillance would be recommended.

TI Efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies and prevalence of
   molecular markers associated with artemisinin, piperaquine and
   sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Sierra Leone
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Currently, the national malaria control programme (NMCP) of Sierra Leone recommends artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as first- and second-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, respectively, and artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy and for infants. In 2016, the NMCP conducted a study to assess the clinical and parasitological responses of children under five years to ASAQ, AL and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/PPQ) according to the WHO protocol. Day-0 samples were tested for mutations in the Kelch 13 gene (pfk13) and dihydrofolate reductase/dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhfr/pfdhps) genes associated with artemisinin and SP resistance, respectively, and amplification in the pfplasmepsin2 gene for piperaquine resistance. A total of 295 (ASAQ = 128, AL = 64 and DHA/PPQ = 103) eligible children were enrolled at three sites. PCR-corrected 100% adequate clinical and parasitological response and no parasitaemia on day-3 were observed for all patients in each treatment group. Of the 278 samples with interpretable molecular data, only 2.2% carried non-synonymous pfkl3 mutants (A578S, I646T), which are not associated with artemisinin resistance. None of the 103 day-0 samples from the DAH/PPQ group had pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification, confirming the absence of piperaquine resistance. The prevalence of the triple pfdhfr mutant (N51I/C59R/S108N) was close to or reached fixation (97.4-100%). For combined pfdhfr/pfdhps mutation, 55-71% carried the quadruple (N51I/C59R/S108N + A437G) mutant and about 10% the quintuple mutant N51I/C59R/S108N +A437G/K540E. Our findings confirm that ASAQ, AL and DHA/PPQ were highly effective for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the study areas, and neither pflc13 validated mutations nor pfplasmepsin2 multiple copies were found. The very low prevalence of the quintuple mutant in this study supports the NMCP's decision to introduce intermittent preventive treatment for infants with SP in the districts with high malaria transmission.

TI A novel nested polymerase chain reaction assay targeting Plasmodium
   mitochondrial DNA in field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes
SO MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB Sensitive techniques for the detection of Plasmodium (Aconoidasida: Plasmodiidae) sporozoites in field-collected malaria vectors are essential for the correct assessment of risk for malaria transmission. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol targeting Plasmodium mtDNA proved to be much more sensitive in detecting sporozoites in mosquitoes than the widely used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay targeting Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CSP-ELISA). However, because of the relatively high costs associated with equipment and reagents, RT-PCR5 are mostly used to assess the outcomes of experimental infections in the frame of research experiments, rather than in routine monitoring of mosquito infection in the field. The present authors developed a novel mtDNA-based nested PCR protocol, modified from a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Plasmodium recognition in human blood samples, and compared its performance with that of routinely used CSP-ELISAs in field-collected Anopheles coluzzii (Diptera: Culicidae) samples. The nested PCR showed 1.4-fold higher sensitivity than the CSP-ELISA. However, nested PCR results obtained in two laboratories and in different replicates within the same laboratory were not 100% consistent, probably because the copy number of amplifiable Plasmodium mtDNA was close in some specimens to the threshold of nested PCR sensitivity. This implies that Plasmodium-positive specimens should be confirmed by a second nested PCR to avoid false positives. Overall, the results emphasize the need to use molecular approaches to obtain accurate estimates of the actual level of Plasmodium circulation within malaria vector populations.

TI Spatio-temporal distribution of PfMDR1 polymorphism among uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases along international border of north
   east India
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB PfMDR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are good correlate markers for antimalarial drug resistance worldwide. Present study is a comprehensive view of screening of PfMDR1 polymorphism to antimalarials practiced with geography and time. Study sites Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya chosen are at multivariate drug pressure due to cross border migration and transmission. Mizoram is gateway to south east Asia through Myanmar whereas Tripura, Meghalaya share porous border with Bangladesh. Baseline finger pricked blood stained filter paper for confirmed uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infected patients (year 2015) were obtained from National Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi, India. PfMDR1 polymorphism for codon N86Y, Y184F, D1246Y was determined by PCR-RFLP, further confirmed by sequencing. There observed marked predominance of Plasmodium isolates with PfMDR1 wild type alleles for all codons under study i.e. 86, 184, 1246. Spatially, Plasmodium isolates from Mizoram were most diverse with co-existence of PfMDR1 genotype with NYD, YYD, NFD haplotypes, followed by Tripura. Isolates from Meghalaya were of all NYD haplotype. Reports, referring to screening of PfMDR1 SNPs to CQ/SP/AS-SP across India, were archived. Temporal study show distinct rise in proportion of PfMDR1 wild type N86 allele since introduction of Artemether-Lumefantrine as first line antimalarial. Hence spatio-temporal screening of Plasmodium population with PfMDR1 single nucleotide polymorphism accounts for its association with antimalarial susceptibility and validate PfMDR1 SNPs as antimalarial drug resistant marker.

TI Detecting eukaryotic microbiota with single-cell sensitivity in human
   tissue
SO MICROBIOME
AB Background: Fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth are major adverse pregnancy outcomes. These complications are considerable contributors to fetal/maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A significant proportion of these cases are thought to be due to dysfunction of the placenta. However, the underlying mechanisms of placental dysfunction are unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with evidence of placental eukaryotic infection.
   Results: We modified the 18S Illumina Amplicon Protocol of the Earth Microbiome Project and made it capable of detecting just a single spiked-in genome copy of Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or Toxoplasma gondii among more than 70,000 human cells. Using this method, we were unable to detect eukaryotic pathogens in placental biopsies in instances of adverse pregnancy outcome (n = 199) or in healthy controls (n = 99).
   Conclusions: Eukaryotic infection of the placenta is not an underlying cause of the aforementioned pregnancy complications. Possible clinical applications for this non-targeted, yet extremely sensitive, eukaryotic screening method are manifest.

TI Investigation of a case of suspected transfusion-transmitted malaria
SO TRANSFUSION
AB BACKGROUNDTransfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is a rare occurrence with serious consequences for the recipient. A case study is presented as an example of best practices for conducting a TTM investigation.
   CASE REPORTA 15-year-old male with a history of sickle cell disease developed fever after a blood transfusion. He was diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and was successfully treated. The American Red Cross, New York State Department of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the eight donors who provided components to the transfusion. The investigation to identify a malaria-positive donor included trace back of donors, serologic methods to identify donor(s) with a history of malaria exposure, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, microsatellite analysis to identify the parasite in a donor and match its genotype to the parasite in the recipient, and reinterview of all donors to clarify malaria risk factors.
   RESULTSOne donor had evidence of infection with P. falciparum by PCR, elevated antibody titers, and previously undisclosed malaria risk factors. Reinterview revealed that the donor immigrated to the United States from Togo just short of 3 years before the blood donation. The donor was treated for asymptomatic low parasitemia infection.
   CONCLUSIONThis investigation used standard procedures for investigating TTM but also demonstrated the importance of applying sensitive laboratory techniques to identify the infected donor, especially a donor with asymptomatic infection with low parasitemia. Repeat interview of all donors identified as having contributed to the transfused component provides complementary epidemiologic information to confirm the infected donor.

AB Introduction: Malaria is still a major problem in Indonesia. Therefore the development of its vaccine that can be created with radiation is urgently needed. This research aims to determine the genotype of blood specimens obtained from 4-22 years old malaria outpatients in Jayapura General Hospital, Papua. The information obtained will be a great value in additional knowledge for vaccine development of irradiated gamma-ray parasites. Methodology: Microscopic examination on thin blood smear was done, followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) diagnosis to further confirm the parasite using 18S rRNA gene and mitochondrial primers on deoxyribonucleic acid extracted using chelex-100 ion exchanger and the presence of each mutation in the genes was examined using restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results: Our result showed that nine samples infected with Plasmodium falciparum and 1 with P. vivax. Beside that nine samples carried mutations in pfcrt and 22% in pfmdr1. Mutations involving N1042D in pfmdr1 gene was also detected in 3 samples (33%). Mutations in dhfr gene at codon S108N were detected in all nine samples. Mutations in this gene at codon K540E have also detected in 3 (33%) samples. Conclusion: Analysis of the parasite genotype indicated that infection occurred with multiple parasite strains. The majority of the samples carried the 3D7 type of MSP2 gene while others carried the FC27 type. The MSP1 genes observed carried K1, MAD20, and RO33 types but some other types could not be determined.

TI Investigation of Plasmodium vivax Rhomboid-like Protease 1 Compared to
   Plasmodium falciparum Rhomboid Protease 1 in Erythrocytic Cycle
SO CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Plasmodium Rhomboids (ROM) are members of a family of serine pro teases that play key roles in erythrocyte invasion. To date, the P. vivax ROM-like 1 (PvROM-like 1) protein has not been characterized. This study aimed to detect the rhomboid proteins in the erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite. Infected blood samples were collected from malaria clinics in Mae Sot, Tak, Thailand during September 2013 - May 2014. Extracted RNA was examined for the presence of Pvrom-like 1 by RT-PCR. The corresponding protein was characterized using SOS-PAGE, Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. The apparent molecular weight of PvROM-like 1 protein was estimated to be approximately 30 kDa using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. PvROM-like 1 and PfROM1 proteins could be detected by use of anti-PfROM1 and anti-PbROM1 antibodies, hut not with an anti-DroROM1 antibody. Our results show that PvROM-like 1 protein is found in all erythrocytic stages of the P. vivax cycle and may function in the invasion of malaria into red blood cells.

TI Clinical enzymes as possible immunological biomarkers in the diagnosis
   of malaria, human African and American trypanosomiasis
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Peripheral blood smear microscopy still remains the gold standard for diagnosing malaria and trypanosomiasis. Microscopy is a labor-intensive process and requires great amount of skill to accomplish. Even though cheap and easy to perform, it still has several limitations. This hinders the microscopist in identifying protozoan structure or differentiating species from one another. Considering these factors in the performance of microscopic examination, it is crucial to identify new strategies for parasite identification and species differentiation. Innovations in clinical enzymology, immunodiagnostics, and molecular technology would be of help in resolving the problem. This study mainly focused on the possible role of clinical enzymes in malaria and trypanosomiasis diagnosis. Enzymes play a vital role in parasite physiology and metabolism. They enable the parasite to survive inside the living host by initiating different metabolic cycles. These enzymes can either be expressed on the surface of the protozoa or excreted in the extracellular environment. Lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were the significant enzymes associated with pathogenic Plasmodium spp. Other malarial enzymes were also identified but further validation is still required to establish their use as diagnostic biomarkers. Whereas, the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase was identified as significant for diagnosing and differentiating Trypanosoma spp. Analysis of these enzymes can be used as alternative means for microscopy in parasite identification and differentiation. Application of these enzymes as immunologic markers in various diagnostic test kits should be further evaluated.

TI Within-host modeling of blood-stage malaria
SO IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB Malaria infection continues to be a major health problem worldwide and drug resistance in the major human parasite species, Plasmodium falciparum, is increasing in South East Asia. Control measures including novel drugs and vaccines are in development, and contributions to the rational design and optimal usage of these interventions are urgently needed. Infection involves the complex interaction of parasite dynamics, host immunity, and drug effects. The long life cycle (48 hours in the common human species) and synchronized replication cycle of the parasite population present significant challenges to modeling the dynamics of Plasmodium infection. Coupled with these, variation in immune recognition and drug action at different life cycle stages leads to further complexity. We review the development and progress of "within-host" models of Plasmodium infection, and how these have been applied to understanding and interpreting human infection and animal models of infection.

TI High prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum antimalarial drug resistance
   markers in isolates from asymptomatic patients from the Republic of the
   Congo between 2010 and 2015
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
AB Objectives: This study investigated the prevalence of haplotypes of the Pfdhps, Pfdhfr, Pfcrt, Pfmdr1 and PfK13 resistance markers in isolates from asymptomatic patients from the Republic of the Congo following implementation of artemisinin based-combination therapy (ACT).
   Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from asymptomatic children in 2010 and 2015 from Brazzaville in the south and in 2013 in the north of the Congo. Genotypes of Pfmdr1, Pfcrt, Pfdhps, Pfdhfr and PfK13 were assessed by PCR.
   Results: Children from 2010 were younger than those from 2015 (mean age 5.38 years vs. 8.67 years; P= 0.003). The main Pfcrt haplotype was the wild-type CVMNK (84.85%) in 2010, whereas the mutant CVIET (61.64%) predominated in 2015 (P<0.001). In the north, 45.00% of samples were CVMNK and 10.00% were CVIET. Other samples harboured new haplotypes in the country or mixed alleles. No significant difference in Pfmdr1 haplotypes was observed in 2010 and 2015 and the main haplotypes were NYD and NFD (30.56% vs. 28.57% and 61.11% vs. 42.86% for 2010 and 2015, respectively). In the south, the Pfdhps haplotypes observed were AAKAA, AGKAA, SGKAA and SGEGA (87.50% vs. 0%, 12.50% vs. 33.33%, 0% vs. 33.33% and 0% vs. 33.33% for 2010 and 2015, respectively). For Pfdhfr, the IRNI haplotype was most prevalent (85.71% for 2010, 87.50% for 2013 and 100% for 2015). No PfK13 mutations were found.
   Conclusions: Monitoring the efficacy of ACT and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is necessary to ensure an epidemiological survey of asymptomatic malaria.

TI Functional Conservation of P48/45 Proteins in the Transmission Stages of
   Plasmodium vivax (Human Malaria Parasite) and P-berghei (Murine Malaria
   Parasite)
SO MBIO
AB Sexual-stage proteins have a distinct function in the mosquito vector during transmission and also represent targets for the development of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine. P48/45, a leading vaccine candidate, is critical for male gamete fertility and shows > 50% similarity across various species of Plasmodium. We evaluated functional conservation of P48/45 in Plasmodium vivax and P. berghei with the motivation to establish transgenic P. berghei strains expressing P. vivax P48/45 (Pvs48/45) in an in vivo assay to evaluate the transmission-blocking activity of antibodies elicited by Pvs48/45. Homologous recombination was employed to target P. berghei s48/45 (pbs48/45) for knockout (KO) or for its replacement by two different forms of P. vivax s48/45 (pvs48/45) (the full-length gene and a chimeric gene consisting of pbs48/45 5' signal and 3' anchor sequences flanking pvs48/45). Expression of Pvs48/45 in transgenic parasites and lack of expression of any P48/45 in KO parasites were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Both transgenic and knockout parasites revealed asexual growth kinetics in mice comparable to that seen with wild-type parasites. When employed in mosquito infection experiments, both transgenic parasite strains remained transmission competent and developed into infectious sporozoites, whereas the knockout parasites were incapable of establishing mosquito-stage infection. These results indicate the functional conservation of P48/45 protein during transmission, and the transgenic parasites generated in this study represent a valuable tool to evaluate the protective efficacy of transmission-blocking antibodies elicited by Pvs48/45-based vaccines using an in vivo mouse animal assay instead of ex vivo membrane feeding assays (MFA) relying on access to P. vivax gametocytes from infected patients.
   IMPORTANCE Malaria transmission depends upon successful sexual differentiation and maturation of parasites in the vertebrate host and further development in the mosquito midgut. Stage-specific proteins in the sexual stages have been shown to play a critical role in development and successful transmission through the anopheline mosquito vector. Studies presented in the current manuscript evaluated functional conservation of one such protein, P48/45, in two diverse species (P. berghei and P. vivax). Replacement of endogenous pbs48/45 in P. berghei with pvs48/45 (P. vivax homologue) did not affect the viability of the parasites, and the transgenic parasites expressing Pvs48/45 remained transmission competent. These studies establish not only the functional conservation of P48/45 in P. berghei and P. vivax but also offer an opportunity to develop an in vivo test model for Pvs48/45-based P. vivax transmission-blocking vaccines, currently under development.

TI Hepatitis B and asymptomatic malaria coinfection in Sub-Saharan African
   immigrants: epidemiological and clinical features of HBV infection
SO REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB Introduction: Here, we conducted an epidemiological study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) mono-infected and asymptomatic malaria/HBV coinfected immigrants and further discussed the possibility of malaria disease modifying the clinical presentation of HBV infection. Methods: A total of 195 African immigrants were examined for HBV infection or coinfection with HBV and asymptomatic malaria. HBV infection was diagnosed using serological tests and confirmed by PCR; furthermore, we performed a pan-Plasmodium-specific-nucleic-acid-sequence-based-amplification (NASBA) assay to detect asymptomatic malaria infection. The stage/grade of the liver disease was determined using echotomography and elastometry. Results: PCR-NASBA results confirmed that 62 of 195 subjects (31.8%) were positive for Plasmodium infection, whereas 41 of 195 subjects (21%) tested positive for HBV chronic hepatitis (HBV-DNA positive). Among the HBV-positive subjects, 26 (63.4%) of them were mono-infected patients (Group A), whereas 15 (36.6%) patients had HBV chronic hepatitis and asymptomatic malaria coinfections (Group B). The HBV-DNA median levels were 1.4x10(5)IU/mL in HBV-mono-infected patients and 2.0x10(5)IU/mL in coinfected patients. Echotomography and hepatic elastometry presented similar findings for both groups of patients. Conclusions: Coinfected patients seem to present with the same clinical symptoms of the liver disease as HBV mono-infected patients.

TI Females of HbAS genotype have reduced concentration of the malaria
   protective deoxyhemoglobin S than males
SO PLOS ONE
AB The quantity of the intra-erythrocytic deoxyhemoglobin S (Hb S) affects the level of protection against malaria and also the sickling phenomenon. This study reports on significantly lower concentration of Hb S in females than males. Data came from 350 children, aged 12-47 months who participated in a phase 2b malaria vaccine trial. Hemoglobinopathy and G6PD deficiency typing was necessary to ascertain equal representation of these malaria protective traits across the vaccine cohorts. Hemoglobin types (HbAA, HbAS) and % Hb S were evaluated by HPLC. Alpha thalassemia (alpha-that) and G6PD genotypes were evaluated by PCR. The overall prevalence for HbAS was 20%, 46% for 3 alpha genes and 10% for 2 alpha genes and 14% for G6PD A-. More females of HbAS/act/aa genotype had low Hb S than males and had mean % Hb S of 37.5% +/- 5.4 SD, compared to 42.0% +/- 2.5 SD in males of same genotype (P = 0.018). Consistent with reduction of the malaria protective Hb S in females, parasite load in females was nearly twice that of males but the difference was not statistically significant. The X-chromosome linked G6PD deficiency did not influence the level of Hb S. We conclude that, the low Hb S in these females explains the resultant higher malaria parasite load. We speculate that the low Hb S in females could also explain observations suggesting that the sickling phenomenon tends to be less severe in females than males.

TI Prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with sub-microscopic
   parasite densities in the northwestern border of Thailand: a potential
   threat to malaria elimination
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Asymptomatic infections with sub-microscopic Plasmodium serve as a silent reservoir of disease, critical to sustaining a low level of remanent malaria in the population. These infections must be effectively identified and targeted for elimination. The sensitivity of light microscopy, the traditional method used for diagnosing Plasmodium infections, is frequently insufficient for detecting asymptomatic infections due to the low density of parasitaemia. The objective of this study was to explore the current prevalence of asymptomatic sub-microscopic Plasmodium carriages to evaluate the parasite reservoir amongst residents from 7 hamlets in Tak Province in northwestern Thailand using a highly sensitive molecular method.
   Methods: Malaria infection was screened in a real-world setting from 3650 finger-prick blood specimens collected in a mass cross-sectional survey using light microscopy and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP results were later confirmed in a laboratory setting in Bangkok using nested PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The association of malaria infection with demographic factors was explored.
   Results: Parasite prevalence was 0.27% (10/3650) as determined by microscopy. Sub-microscopic infection prevalence was 2.33% (85/3650) by LAMP. Of these, 30.6% (26/85) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 52.9% (45/85) with Plasmodium vivax, 2.4% (2/85) with Plasmodium malariae, 4.7% (4/85) with mixed P falciparum and P vivax, and 9.4% (8/85) had parasite densities too low for species identification. Asymptomatic carriages (T<37.5 degrees C) accounted for 95% (76/80) of all sub-microscopic cases with the highest prevalence occurring in the subjects 31-45 years of age (p <= 0.035). Participants working on plantations or as merchants had an increased infection risk. Evaluation by microscopy identified 10.53% (10/95) of all Plasmodium infected participants.
   Conclusion: Participants carrying asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with sub-microscopic parasite densities are considerable in this area. These findings provide the true disease burden and risk factors in this region. This information helps to direct policy makers towards better schemes and delivery of targeted interventions. Moreover, this is the first study to use LAMP in mass screening for sub-clinical and sub-microscopic infections in a field setting in Thailand. LAMP proves to be a sensitive and field-deployable assay suitable for national malaria control screening campaigns.

TI Do hotspots fuel malaria transmission: a village-scale spatio-temporal
   analysis of a 2-year cohort study in The Gambia
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: Despite the biological plausibility of hotspots fueling malaria transmission, the evidence to support this concept has been mixed. If transmission spreads from high burden to low burden households in a consistent manner, then this could have important implications for control and elimination program development.
   Methods: Data from a longitudinal cohort in The Gambia was analyzed. All consenting individuals residing in 12 villages across the country were sampled monthly from June (dry season) to December 2013 (wet season), in April 2014 (mid dry season), and monthly from June to December 2014. A study nurse stationed within each village recorded passively detected malaria episodes between visits. Plasmodium falciparum infections were determined by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a geostatistical model.
   Results: Household-level observed monthly incidence ranged from 0 to 0.50 infection per person (interquartile range = 0.02-0.10) across the sampling months, and high burden households exist across all study villages. There was limited evidence of a spatio-temporal pattern at the monthly timescale irrespective of transmission intensity. Within-household transmission was the most plausible hypothesis examined to explain the observed heterogeneity in infections.
   Conclusions: Within-village malaria transmission patterns are concentrated in a small proportion of high burden households, but patterns are stochastic regardless of endemicity. Our findings support the notion of transmission occurring at the household and village scales but not the use of a targeted approach to interrupt spreading of infections from high to low burden areas within villages in this setting.

TI Sample-to-answer palm-sized nucleic acid testing device towards low-cost
   malaria mass screening
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB The effectiveness of malaria screening and treatment highly depends on the low-cost access to the highly sensitive and specific malaria test. We report a real-time fluorescence nucleic acid testing device for malaria field detection with automated and scalable sample preparation capability. The device consists a compact analyzer and a disposable microfluidic reagent compact disc. The parasite DNA sample preparation and subsequent realtime LAMP detection were seamlessly integrated on a single microfluidic compact disc, driven by energy efficient non-centrifuge based magnetic field interactions. Each disc contains four parallel testing units which could be configured either as four identical tests or as four species-specific tests. When configured as species-specific tests, it could identify two of the most life-threatening malaria species (P. falciparum and P. vivax). The NAT device is capable of processing four samples simultaneously within 50 min turnaround time. It achieves a detection limit of similar to 0.5 parasites/mu I for whole blood, sufficient for detecting asymptomatic parasite carriers. The combination of the sensitivity, specificity, cost, and scalable sample preparation suggests the real-time fluorescence TAMP device could be particularly useful for malaria screening in the field settings.

TI A Controlled Trial of Mass Drug Administration to Interrupt Transmission
   of Multidrug-Resistant Falciparum Malaria in Cambodian Villages
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The increase in multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia suggests a need for acceleration of malaria elimination. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt malaria transmission.
   Methods. Four malaria-endemic villages in western Cambodia were randomized to 3 rounds of MDA (a 3-day course of dihydroartemisinin with piperaquine-phosphate), administered either early in or at the end of the study period. Comprehensive malaria treatment records were collected during 2014-2017. Subclinical parasite prevalence was estimated by ultrasensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction quarterly over 12 months.
   Results. MDA coverage with at least 1 complete round was 88% (1999/2268), >= 2 rounds 73% (1645/2268), and all 3 rounds 58% (1310/2268). Plasmodium falciparum incidence in intervention and control villages was similar over the 12 months prior to the study: 39 per 1000 person-years (PY) vs 45 per 1000 PY (P=.50). The primary outcome, P. falciparum incidence in the 12 months after MDA, was lower in intervention villages (1.5/1000 PY vs 37.1/1000 PY; incidence rate ratio, 24.5 [95% confidence interval], 3.4-177; P=.002). Following MDA in 2016, there were no clinical falciparum malaria cases over 12 months (0/2044 PY) in all 4 villages. Plasmodium vivax prevalence decreased markedly in intervention villages following MDA but returned to approximately half the baseline prevalence by 12 months. No severe adverse events were attributed to treatment.
   Conclusions. Mass drug administrations achieved high coverage, were safe, and associated with the absence of clinical P. falciparum cases for at least 1 year.

TI Comparison of three diagnostic methods (microscopy, RDT, and PCR) for
   the detection of malaria parasites in representative samples from
   Equatorial Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria in Equatorial Guinea remains a major public health problem. The country is a holo-endemic area with a year-round transmission pattern. In 2016, the prevalence of malaria was 12.09% and malaria caused 15% of deaths among children under 5 years. In the Continental Region, 95.2% of malaria infections were Plasmodium falciparum, 9.5% Plasmodium vivax, and eight cases mixed infection in 2011. The main strategy for malaria control is quick and accurate diagnosis followed by effective treatment. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is essential for both effective disease management and malaria surveillance. The quality of malaria diagnosis is important in all settings, as misdiagnosis can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Microscopy and RDTs are the primary choices for diagnosing malaria in the field. However, false-negative results may delay treatment and increase the number of persons capable of infecting mosquitoes in the community. The present study analysed the performance of microscopy and RDTs, the two main techniques used in Equatorial Guinea for the diagnosis of malaria, compared to semi-nested multiplex PCR (SnM-PCR).
   Results: A total of 1724 samples tested by microscopy, RDT, and SnM-PCR were analysed. Among the negative samples detected by microscopy, 335 (19.4%) were false negatives. On the other hand, the negative samples detected by RDT, 128 (13.3%) were false negatives based on PCR. This finding is important, especially since it is a group of patients who did not receive antimalarial treatment.
   Conclusions: Owing to the high number of false negatives in microscopy, it is necessary to reinforce training in microscopy, the "Gold Standard" in endemic areas. A network of reference centres could potentially support ongoing diagnostic and control efforts made by malaria control programmes in the long term, as the National Centre of Tropical Medicine currently supports the National Programme against Malaria of Equatorial Guinea to perform all of the molecular studies necessary for disease control. Taking into account the results obtained with the RDTs, an exhaustive study of the deletion of the hrp2 gene must be done in EG to help choose the correct RDT for this area.

TI The prevalence of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte
   carriage and multiplicity of infection in children, pregnant women and
   adults in a low malaria transmission area in Southern Ghana
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The gametocyte stage of Plasmodium falciparum is considered an important target for disrupting malaria transmission. Indications are that various demographic groups, such as children and pregnant women may differ in risk of harbouring gametocytes, which may be crucial for targeted control. In this study, the relationship between the prevalence and multiplicity of P. falciparum, asexual parasite infections and gametocytaemia was assessed in three different demographic groups in an area of southern Ghana with low malaria endemicity. Levels of antibody responses to Pfs230 were also assessed as a proxy for the presence of gametocytes.
   Methods: The study involved multiple cross-sectional sampling of children (N = 184, aged 2-15 years), male and non-pregnant female adults (N = 154, aged 16-65 years) and pregnant women (N = 125, aged 18-45 years) from Asutsuare in the Shai Osudoku District of Greater Accra Region in Ghana. Asexual parasitaemia was detected by microscopy and PCR, and gametocytaemia was assessed by Pfs25-real time PCR. Multiclonal P. falciparum infections were estimated by msp2 genotyping and an indirect ELISA was used to measure plasma IgG antibodies to Pfs230 antigen.
   Results: Overall, children and pregnant women had higher prevalence of submicroscopic gametocytes (39.5% and 29.7%, respectively) compared to adults (17.4%). Multiplicity of infection observed amongst children (3.1) and pregnant women (3.9) were found to be significantly higher (P = 0.006) compared with adults (2.7). Risk of gametocyte carriage was higher in individuals infected with P. falciparum having both Pfmsp2 3D7 and FC27 parasite types (OR = 5.92, 95% CI 1.56-22.54, P = 0.009) compared with those infected with only 3D7 or FC27 parasite types. In agreement with the parasite prevalence data, anti-Pfs230 antibody levels were lower in gametocyte positive adults (beta = -0.57, 95% CI -0.81, -0.34, P < 0.001) compared to children.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that children and pregnant women are particularly important as P. falciparum submicroscopic gametocyte reservoirs and represent important focus groups for control interventions. The number of clones increased in individuals carrying gametocytes compared to those who did not carry gametocytes. The higher anti-gametocyte antibody levels in children suggests recent exposure and may be a marker of gametocyte carriage.

TI Restriction enzyme digestion of host DNA enhances universal detection of
   parasitic pathogens in blood via targeted amplicon deep sequencing
SO MICROBIOME
AB Background: Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) of the 16S rRNA gene is commonly used to explore and characterize bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile, attempts to apply TADS to the detection and characterization of entire parasitic communities have been hampered since conserved regions of many conserved parasite genes, such as the 18S rRNA gene, are also conserved in their eukaryotic hosts. As a result, targeted amplification of 185 rRNA from clinical samples using universal primers frequently results in competitive priming and preferential amplification of host DNA. Here, we describe a novel method that employs a single pair of universal primers to capture all blood-borne parasites while reducing host 185 rRNA template and enhancing the amplification of parasite 185 rRNA for TADS. This was achieved using restriction enzymes to digest the 18S rRNA gene at cut sites present only in the host sequence prior to PCR amplification.
   Results: This method was validated against 16 species of blood-borne helminths and protozoa. Enzyme digestion prior to PCR enrichment and Illumina amplicon deep sequencing led to a substantial reduction in human reads and a corresponding 5- to 10-fold increase in parasite reads relative to undigested samples. This method allowed for discrimination of all common parasitic agents found in human blood, even in cases of multi-parasite infection, and markedly reduced the limit of detection in digested versus undigested samples.
   Conclusions: The results herein provide a novel methodology for the reduction of host DNA prior to TADS and establish the validity of a next-generation sequencing-based platform for universal parasite detection.

TI Human infection with Plasmodium knowlesi on the Laos-Vietnam border
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background: Border malaria in the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia poses a serious threat to the health of the ethnic minority populations of the region. Traditionally thought to be caused primarily by the malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, recently a zoonotic parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, has been identified in some countries of the region. The presence of this parasite poses a challenge to malaria control programmes, as it is maintained in a zoonotic reservoir of forest-dwelling macaque monkeys.
   Methods: A cross-sectional malaria parasite species prevalence survey was conducted along the Laos-Vietnam border in the central part of the two countries. Human blood samples were collected from Savannakhet in Laos and Quang Tri in Vietnam between August and October 2010 and assayed for the presence of human malaria parasite species and P. knowlesi. A PCR targeting the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene and circumsporozoite protein gene was used for Plasmodium species identification.
   Results: Nine cases of P. knowlesi were detected by PCR in blood samples from the Laos side and three from the Vietnam side. All P. knowlesi infections were found in co-infection with P. vivax, with some triple infections of P. knowlesi, P. vivax and P. falciparum detected in Laos. Phylogenetic analysis of these parasites suggests that P. knowlesi is circulating in the Laos-Vietnam border region.
   Conclusion: This report shows that P. knowlesi is transmited on both sides of the Vietnam-Laos border. Continued monitoring of the range and prevalence of P. knowlesi on both the sides of Laos-Vietnam border is of importance to the National Malaria Control Programmes of both countries.

TI Molecular identification of Plasmodium species in symptomatic children
   of Democratic Republic of Congo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Worldwide, the highest malaria mortality is due to Plasmodium falciparum infection. However, other species of Plasmodium (Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi) can also cause malaria. Therefore, accurate identification of malaria species is crucial for patient management and epidemiological surveillance.This study aimed to determine the different Plasmodium species causing malaria in children under 5 years old in two provinces (Kinshasa and North Kivu) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
   Methods: From October to December 2015, a health-facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in General Reference Hospitals in Kinshasa and North Kivu. Four hundred and seven blood samples were collected from febrile children aged <= 5 years. Nested polymerase chain reaction assays were performed for Plasmodium species identification.
   Results: Out of 407 children, 142 (34.9%) were infected with Plasmodium spp. and P falciparum was the most prevalent species (99.2%). Among those infected children, 124 had a mono infection with P. faiciparum and one with P. malariae. Mixed infections with P. falciparum/P. malariae and P. falciparum/P. vivax were observed in 6 (1.5%) and 8 (2.0%) children, respectively. The prevalence of infection was higher in females (64.8%) than in males (35.2%), p<0.001. The age-specific distribution of infection showed that children of less than 2 years old were less infected (18.4%) compared to those aged above 2 years (81.6%), p<0.001.
   Conclusion: Although this study showed clearly that the most prevalent species identified was P. faiciparum, the findings demonstrate the existence of non-falciparum malaria, especially P. malariae and P. vivax among children aged <= 5 years living both Kinshasa and North Kivu Provinces in DRC.

TI Molecular assays for antimalarial drug resistance surveillance: A target
   product profile
SO PLOS ONE
AB Antimalarial drug resistance is a major constraint for malaria control and elimination efforts. Artemisinin-based combination therapy is now the mainstay for malaria treatment. However, delayed parasite clearance following treatment with artemisinin derivatives has now spread in the Greater Mekong Sub region and may emerge or spread to other malaria endemic regions. This spread is of great concern for malaria control programmes, as no alternatives to artemisinin-based combination therapies are expected to be available in the near future. There is a need to strengthen surveillance systems for early detection and response to the antimalarial drug resistance threat. Current surveillance is mainly done through therapeutic efficacy studies; however these studies are complex and both time-and resource-intensive. For multiple common antimalarials, parasite drug resistance has been correlated with specific genetic mutations, and the molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance offer a simple and powerful tool to monitor the emergence and spread of resistant parasites. Different techniques to analyse molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance are available, each with advantages and disadvantages. However, procedures are not adequately harmonized to facilitate comparisons between sites. Here we describe the target product profiles for tests to analyse molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance, discuss how use of current techniques can be standardised, and identify the requirements for an ideal product that would allow malaria endemic countries to provide useful spatial and temporal information on the spread of resistance.

TI Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency allelic variants and their
   prevalence in malaria patients in Eritrea
SO PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Introduction: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy with a relatively high frequency in malaria-endemic regions. In Eritrea, there is scanty knowledge of G6PD deficiency. The aim of the study was to characterize and determine the prevalence of four common G6PD allelic variants. Methods: three hundred and fourteen dried blood spot samples from unrelated microscopically diagnosed malaria patient Eritrean ethnic groups living in five zobas (regions) of Eritrea were analysed by PCR-RFLP method to identify the G6PD B, G6PD A (A376G), G6PD A-(G202A), and G6PD Mediterranean (C563T) variants. To confirm the RFLP results, samples positive for A376G but negative for G202A variants were subjected to Sanger sequencing and a subset of PCR products (exon 5) directly sequenced to identify A376G and other mutations. Results: for G6PD genotyping, G6PD B was detected in 87.5% and A376G detected in 12.5% of malaria patients, whereas G202A and C563T were absent. Bivariate Statistical analysis showed a statistically significant association between G6PD genotypes and zoba (P < 0.004 < 0.05). Sequencing revealed the expected A376G variant. In exon 5, four common (A376G) mutations, three uncommon mutations rs782669677 (535G -> A) and one potentially new mutation (451G -> C), relative to the reference, mRNA NM_001042351 were detected. Bioinformatic analysis of these mutations' potential functional impact suggests minimal effect on protein function. Conclusion: this is the first report indicating that G6PD B and G6PD A genotypes are prevalent in Eritrea. Similar findings were reported in neighboring countries. Further studies including phenotype analysis are needed to corroborate the observed results.

TI Automated microscopy for routine malaria diagnosis: a field comparison
   on Giemsa-stained blood films in Peru
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films remains a major form of diagnosis in malaria case management, and is a reference standard for research. However, as with other visualization-based diagnoses, accuracy depends on individual technician performance, making standardization difficult and reliability poor. Automated image recognition based on machine-learning, utilizing convolutional neural networks, offers potential to overcome these drawbacks. A prototype digital microscope device employing an algorithm based on machine-learning, the Autoscope, was assessed for its potential in malaria microscopy. Autoscope was tested in the Iquitos region of Peru in 2016 at two peripheral health facilities, with routine microscopy and PCR as reference standards. The main outcome measures include sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, observational trial was conducted at two peripheral primary health facilities in Peru. 700 participants were enrolled with the criteria: (1) age between 5 and 75 years, (2) history of fever in the last 3 days or elevated temperature on admission, (3) informed consent. The main outcome measures included sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
   Results: At the San Juan clinic, sensitivity of Autoscope for diagnosing malaria was 72% (95% CI 64-80%), and specificity was 85% (95% CI 79-90%). Microscopy performance was similar to Autoscope, with sensitivity 68% (95% CI 59-76%) and specificity 100% (95% CI 98-100%). At San Juan, 85% of prepared slides had a minimum of 600 WBCs imaged, thus meeting Autoscope's design assumptions. At the second clinic, Santa Clara, the sensitivity of Autoscope was 52% (95% CI 44-60%) and specificity was 70% (95% CI 64-76%). Microscopy performance at Santa Clara was 42% (95% CI 34-51) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 94-99). Only 39% of slides from Santa Clara met Autoscope's design assumptions regarding WBCs imaged.
   Conclusions: Autoscope's diagnostic performance was on par with routine microscopy when slides had adequate blood volume to meet its design assumptions, as represented by results from the San Juan clinic. Autoscope's diagnostic performance was poorer than routine microscopy on slides from the Santa Clara clinic, which generated slides with lower blood volumes. Results of the study reflect both the potential for artificial intelligence to perform tasks currently conducted by highly-trained experts, and the challenges of replicating the adaptiveness of human thought processes.

TI Amplification of GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 gene in Plasmodium falciparum
   isolates with the quadruple mutant of dihydrofolate reductase and
   dihydropteroate synthase genes in Ghana
SO PLOS ONE
AB Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used as malaria chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women and children in Ghana. Plasmodium falciparum resistance to SP is linked to mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase gene (pfdhps), dihydrofolate reductase gene (pfdhfr) and amplification of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) gene. The pfgch1 duplication is associated with pfdhfr L164, a crucial mutant for high level pyrimethamine resistance which is rare in Ghana. The presence of amplified pfgch1 in Ghanaian isolates could be an indicator of the evolution of the L164 mutant. This study therefore determined the pfgch1 copy number variations and SP resistance mutations in clinical isolates from Ghana. One hundred and ninety-two (192) blood samples collected from children aged <= 14 years with uncomplicated malaria in 2013-14 and 2015-16 were used. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the pfgch1 copy number and nested PCR-Sanger sequencing used to detect mutations in pfdhps and pfdhfr genes. Twelve parasites (6.3%) harbored double copies of the pfgch1 gene out of the 192 samples. Of the 12, 75% had the pfdhfr I51-R59-N108, 92% had the pfdhps G437 mutant, 8% had the pfdhps E540 and 67% had the SP resistance haplotype IRNG. No L164 was detected in samples with amplified pfgch1. The rare T108 mutant associated with cycloguanil resistance showed predominance (60%) over N108 in the 2015-16 isolates. The observation of parasites with increased copy number of pfgch1 gene is indicative of the future evolution of the rare quadruple pfdhfr mutant, I51-R59-N108-L164, in Ghanaian parasites. Mutant pfdhps isolates also had increased gch1 copy number suggestive that it may also facilitate sulphadoxine resistance. The selection of parasites with pfgch1 gene amplification will enhance the sustenance and persistence of parasites with SP resistance in the country. Policy makers need to begin the search for a replacement chemoprophylaxis drug for malaria vulnerable groups in Ghana.

TI Molecular evaluation of pvdhfr and pvmdr-1 mutants in Plasmodium vivax
   isolates after treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and chloroquine
   in Iran during 2001-2016
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The rising use of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) in the treatment of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has resulted in increased exposure to P. vivax isolates in Iran, where both species are being circulated. In this investigation, the frequency of pvdhfr and pvmdr-1 mutants was assessed in P. vivax strains during 2001-2016 after the introduction of SP/CQ in malarious areas of Iran. The P. vivax isolates (n, 52) were obtained from autochthonous samples in Southeast Iran during 2015-2016. The genomic DNA was extracted and examined using nested polymerase chain reaction-(PCR) and sequencing. Mutations were detected in pvdhfr codons P33L (21.2%), T61 M (25%), S93H (3.9%), and 5117 T (1.9%) and 5 isolates showed double mutations (33 L/ 61 M, 7.7%; 33 L/117 T, 1.9%). No mutation was identified in pvdhfr codons F57 and S58. The pvmdr-1 1076 L mutation was detected in 93.3% of P. vivax isolates. The findings indicated that the frequency of three codons of pvdhfr F57/S58/S117 has decreased from 2001 (1.05%/7.0%/16.9%) to 2016 (0%/0%/1.9%). Genomic analysis of pvmdr-1 showed that the frequency of 1076 L has gradually increased from 2013 (93%) to 2016 (93.3%) (P > .05). The results demonstrated that P. vivax isolates are probably being exited under SP pressure, which reflects the appropriate level of training for field microscopists, as established by Iranian policymakers. Emergent pvdhfr codons 33L, 61M, and 93H should be noticed in plausible drug tolerance and treatment plans. The high prevalence of pvmdr-1 1076L mutation shows that efficacy of CQ combination with primaquine may be in danger of being compromised, however further investigations are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of CQ-resistant P. vivax isolates.

TI Exploring the TLR and NLR signaling pathway relevant molecules induced
   by the Theileria annulata infection in calves
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Theileria annulata is the pathogen of bovine tropical theileriosis. It is extremely harmful to the cattle industry, with huge economic losses. The toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are crucial for resistance to infection of the protozoa, such as Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the role of these immune-related pathways is unclear during T. annulata infection. In the present study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum were separated from blood samples of calves infected with homogenized tick supernatants carrying T. annulata sporozoites at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h and 168 h postinoculation. The Custom RT2 Profiler PCR Array was used to explore the mRNA levels of 42 TLR and NLR signaling pathway relevant genes. The TLR1, TLR6, TLR10, NLRP1, and MyD88 genes and their downstream signaling molecules significantly differed after the T. annulata infection in comparison with that of preinfection from 72 h to 168 h postinoculation. The serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha were significantly increased at 96 h and 168 h postinfection. These findings provided novel information to help determine the mechanisms of TLR and NLR signaling pathway involvement in protection against T. annulata infection.

TI Genetic diversity at the C-terminal domain of knob-associated
   histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
   Burundi, Eastern Africa
SO ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB The knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) is an exported parasite protein and the major component of infected erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum. P. falciparum histidine-rich protein-1 (PfHRP-1) is docked by KAHRP, which this interaction plays a significant role in cytoadherence of the malaria protozoan to erythrocytes and pathogenicity. The most polymorphic region of the PfHRP-1 is the C-terminal of decapeptide repeat domain (region III). The main objective of this study was to explore the genetic diversity at the region III of KAHRP in P. falciparum isolates from Burundi. In the present study, the nested PCR was performed for the amplification of the coding gene (kahrp gene) for region III in 35 P. falciparum isolates from Burundi. The nested PCR products of seven randomly selected isolates were purified and then sequenced. As the result, three allelic forms (340 bp, 370 bp, and 400 bp) were seen at the C-terminal domain of kahrp gene. The existence of multiple alleles of the kahrp gene revealed the presence of different P. falciparum strains in Burundi. It is suggested that the results could be useful in designing and the improvement of targeted therapy agents for falciparum malaria.

TI Assessment of ultra-sensitive malaria diagnosis versus standard
   molecular diagnostics for malaria elimination: an in-depth molecular
   community cross-sectional study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background Submicroscopic malaria infections contribute to transmission in exposed populations but their extent is underestimated even by standard molecular diagnostics. Sophisticated sampling and ultra-sensitive molecular methods can maximise test sensitivity but are not feasible in routine surveillance. Here we investigate the gains achievable by using increasingly sensitive methods with the aim to understand what diagnostic sensitivity is necessary to guide malaria interventions.
   Methods Venous blood samples were collected from participants in a cross-sectional survey in two coastal medium-endemic villages in Madang province, Papua New Guinea. Using ultra-sensitive quantitative PCR (us-qPCR) on concentrated high-volume blood samples (2 mL) as reference, we quantified the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and gametocyte carriers detectable in fingerprick blood volumes (200 mu L) by standard 18S rRNA qPCR, us-qPCR, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and ultra-sensitive P falciparum RDT. We further compared the epidemiological patterns observed with each diagnostic approach in the study population.
   Findings Venous blood samples were collected from 300 participants between Dec 5, 2016, and Feb 24, 2017 (ie, during peak rainy season). Standard qPCR identified 87 (54%) of 161 P falciparum infections and 73 (52%) of 141 P vivax infections detected by the reference method. us-qPCR identified an additional 11 (7%) P falciparum infections and 14 (10%) P vivax infections. 80 (86%) of 93 P falciparum gametocyte carriers and 75 (91%) of 82 P vivax gametocyte carriers were found among infections detectable by us-qPCR. Ultra-sensitive RDT missed half of P falciparum infections detected by standard qPCR, including high gametocytaemic infections. Epidemiological patterns corresponded well between standard qPCR and the reference method. As the prevalence of P vivax decreased with increasing age, the proportion of P vivax infections undetectable by standard qPCR increased.
   Interpretation Almost all potentially transmitting parasite carriers were identified with us-qPCR on fingerprick blood volumes. Analysing larger blood volumes revealed a large pool of ultra-low-density P falciparum and P vivax infections, which are unlikely to be transmitted. Therefore, current RDTs cannot replace molecular diagnostics for identifying potential P falciparum transmitters. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Strategy to improve malaria surveillance system preventing
   transfusion-transmitted malaria in blood banks using molecular
   diagnostic
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria can be transmitted by blood transfusion through donations collected from asymptomatic or parasitic donors. The parasites are released into the bloodstream during its life cycle and will therefore be present in donated blood by infected individuals. All cases of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) notified since 2005 in Brazil were fatal. A good screening tool for Plasmodium spp. detection in blood units must have a high detection threshold, and the prevention of TTM relies entirely on the exclusion of potentially infected donors. However, in Brazilian blood banks, the screening test relies on blood thick smears examination.
   Methods: The molecular diagnostic based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using real time PCR (mt-qPCR) was improved to detect Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and standardized for use in Plasmodium malariae. The analytic sensitivity of this mt-qPCR methodology was performed using a sample of P. vivax.
   Results: The mt-qPCR was highly efficient, and the analytic sensitivity for P. vivax was determined (0.000006 parasites/mu L). This method was tested to detect P. vivax and P. falciparum in individuals from two malaria-endemic areas in Brazil, Amazon region (Para and Rondonia states), the samples were collected in 10 reference units of two blood banks (Para/nine cities and Rondonia/Porto Velho), and parasites mtDNA were detected in 10 of 2224 potential blood donors (0.45%). In all 10 positive samples, only P. vivax was detected.
   Conclusion: Molecular diagnostic using mt-qPCR was effective in revealing infected potential donors with good perspectives to be applied as screening routine of asymptomatic carriers for preventing transfusion-transmitted malaria in blood banks.

TI Donor-derived multiorgan transmission of mixed P-malariae and P-ovale
   infection: Impact of globalization on post-transplant infections
SO TRANSPLANT INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB A 57-year-old man was admitted with fever and thrombocytopenia 1month after renal transplantation. He had never received a blood transfusion or travelled outside Spain. A peripheral blood smear revealed Plasmodium malariae and P. ovale parasites, diagnosis confirmed later by malaria PCR. The donor, from Equatorial Guinea, had negative thick and thin blood smears and rapid malaria antigen test prior to organ donation. Peripheral blood malaria PCR was not performed during donor screening. The second renal recipient and the liver recipient were evaluated and were found to be asymptomatic. Thick and thin films and rapid malaria diagnostic tests were negative for both patients and blood for malaria PCR was sent to the referral laboratory. The index patient was treated with oral chloroquine diphosphate, with a favorable outcome and was considered cured. Malaria PCR was negative for the other renal recipient and positive for P. malariae and P. ovale curtisi for the liver transplant patient. Both were treated with oral chloroquine and the liver recipient also completed treatment with primaquine phosphate. This reported case of multiorgan transmission of mixed malaria infection highlights the importance of PCR-based tests for Plasmodium in the screening of donors from endemic areas.

TI A diagnostic performance evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests and
   microscopy for malaria diagnosis using nested polymerase chain reaction
   as reference standard in a tertiary hospital in Jos, Nigeria
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests are frequently used in healthcare settings across Nigeria for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which is the commonest form of malaria in the country. In this study, the performance of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was compared with expert microscopy using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the reference standard in a tertiary hospital in Jos, Nigeria.
   Methods: This study was a prospective, cross-sectional, hospital-based study. A total of 200 participants of all ages presenting to Jos University Teaching Hospital with a history of fever or an axillary temperature of >37.5 degrees C were recruited. Blood specimens were collected and malaria testing was done using RDT, microscopy and PCR.
   Results: The prevalence of malaria in this study was 17%, 15% and 13% by PCR, microscopy and RDT, respectively. Compared with microscopy, RDT had Lower sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 56.60-88.54) vs 88.24% (95% CI: 72.55-96.70), Lower specificity of 98.80% (95% CI: 95.72-99.85) vs 100.0% (95% CI: 97.80-100.0), Lower positive predictive value 92.31 (95% CI: 74.89-97.97) vs 100 (95% CI: 98.0-100.0), and Lower negative predictive value 95.35 (95% CI: 91.83-97.39) versus 97.65 (95% CI: 94.30-99.05).
   Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of expert microscopy was better than RDT in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Quality assurance procedures such as using expert microscopy to cross-check a proportion of RDT negative results in patients with clinical features of malaria is desirable.

TI Considerations on PCR-based methods for malaria diagnosis in China
   malaria diagnosis reference laboratory network
SO BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
AB Precise diagnosis is a key measurement for malaria control and elimination, traditional microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests cannot satisfy the requirements especially in the low transmission endemic areas or in the malaria elimination phase. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with high sensitivity and specificity can be considered as a diagnostic standard while no uniform PCR assay was established due to variations in their performance and lack of formal external quality assurance programs for validation for PCR assays in use. Here, 24 articles including 43 paired comparative evaluations limited to paired comparison of diagnostic performance between real-time PCR and conventional PCR to detect plasmodium in blood samples of human subjects from clinics or the field are systematically summarized. And according to the Landis and Koch classification, nineteen pairs showed almost perfect agreement, followed by 8 pairs of moderate agreement and 4 pairs of good agreement, while the kappa values of 12 pairs couldn't be examined. Moreover, the performance of 14 pairs were completely the same and 8 pairs had no differences, but 14 pairs were significant different including 8 pairs of real-time PCR with better performance than conventional PCR. Therefore, it is still an outstanding issue to choose PCR methods, and more work such as the standardization of materials and methods in use and their availability are needed to settle priority to better promote the role of malaria diagnosis reference laboratories.

TI Dynamics of Afebrile Plasmodium falciparum Infections in Mozambican Men
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Afebrile Plasmodium falciparum infections usually remain undetected and untreated in the community and could potentially contribute to sustaining local malaria transmission in areas aiming for malaria elimination.
   Methods. Thirty-two men with afebrile P. falciparum infections detected with rapid diagnostic test (RDTs) were followed for 28 days. Kaplan-Meier estimates were computed to estimate probability of parasite positivity and of reducing parasitemia by half of its initial level by day 28. Trends of parasite densities quantified by microscopy and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were assessed using Poisson regression models, and the microscopy-to-qPCR positivity ratio was calculated at each time point. Three survival distributions (Gompertz, Weibull, and gamma) were used to evaluate their strength of fit to the data and to predict the median lifetime of infection.
   Results. The cumulative probability of parasite qPCR positivity by day 28 was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.2-91.6). Geometric mean parasitemia at recruitment was 516.1 parasites/mu L and fell to <100 parasites/mu L by day 3, reaching 56.7 parasites/mu L on day 28 (P < .001). The ratio of P. falciparum-positive samples by microscopy to qPCR decreased from 0.9 to 0.52 from recruitment to day 28. The best model fit to the data was obtained assuming a Gompertz distribution.
   Conclusions. Afebrile P. falciparum infections detectable by RDT in semi-immune adults fall and stabilize at low-density levels during the first 4 days after detection, suggesting a rapid decline of potential transmissibility in this hidden parasite reservoir.

TI Polymorphisms in TLRs influence circulating cytokines production in
   Plasmodium vivax malaria TLR polymorphisms influence cytokine
   productions in malaria-vivax
SO CYTOKINE
AB The efficiency of the immune system has been shaped throughout the evolutionary process allowing adaptations. In a Plasmodium vivax infection, the host attempts to develop an innate immune response to keep in check the parasite that is associated with inflammatory and regulatory processes. Production of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines simultaneously appears to be a balancing mechanism for the host to prevent the onset of severe disease. Changes in the dynamics of circulating cytokines production can influence the pathogenesis, severity of the disease and episodes of recurrent Plasmodium vivax malaria (Pv-malaria). A cross-sectional study was conducted in endemic areas for Pv-malaria in the Amazonas State, Brazil. Several SNPs in TLR genes were genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 137 patients infected with P. vivax. Circulating cytokines IL-6, TNF, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-y and IL-4 were measured by CBA. Influence of the studied SNPs on circulating cytokines was investigated by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunns' multiple comparison post-test. A Spearman correlation test also was performed to elaborate circulating cytokine networks and to demonstrate the level of interaction between each molecule. Individuals with genotypes A/G (TLR4 A299G), C/C (TLR6 S249P) and T/T (TLR9-1486C/ T) appear to produce less/gain IL-6, IFN-y, IL-10, IL-2 and IL-4 compared to patients with wild-type and heterozygous genotypes. In addition, these genotypes seem to influence the interaction network between the molecules studied, causing a lower interaction, absence or even negative interaction between the cytokines. Data presented in this study suggests the influence of polymorphisms TLR4 (A299G), TLR6 (S249P) and TLR9 (-1486C/T) on the production of circulating cytokines during Pv-malaria.

TI Chloroquine Sensitivity and Prevalence of Chloroquine-resistant Genes
   pfcrt and pfmdr-1 in Western Kenya after Two Decades of Chloroquine
   Withdrawal
SO ANNALS OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES RESEARCH
AB Background: The widespread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kenya lead to the official withdrawal of chloroquine (CQ) drug by the Government as a first-line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in 1999. This study aimed to investigate CQ resistant in Kenya after its withdrawal. Methods: Blood samples were collected on 3M Whatman from patients infected with P. falciparum from Chulaimbo Sub-District Hospital. DNA was extracted using Chelex method for Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of pfcrt and pfmdr-1 genes. PCR--restrictive fragment length polymorphism was performed using enzymes Apol1 and Afl3 targeting point mutation of K76T and N86Y in pfcrt and pfmdr-1 respectively. The PCR products were sequenced, genotyped and further analyzed for amino acid changes in these codons. Chi square tests were used to test the significance of the findings against previous prevalence results. Results: The frequency of pfcrt wild-type codon K76 (chloroquine sensitive) stood at 76.3% while the mutant type codon 76T (chloroquine resistant) at 23.7%. Likewise, the frequency of the pfmdr-1 wild-type codon N86 was 82.9% (chloroquine sensitive) and mutant codon 86Y (chloroquine resistant) was 17.1%. Conclusion: This study observed that there is a significant (chi(2)= 170.1, df=2, p<0.05) increase in CQ sensitivity in 2015 compared to 1999 when it was withdrawn indicating that the prevalence and patterns of point mutations of pfcrt (K76T) and pfmdr-1 (N86Y) is decreasing. This further suggests that CQ-sensitive P. falciparum strains are gradually returning after the withdrawal of CQ from the Kenyan population.

TI Low rates of Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt K76T mutation in three sentinel
   sites of malaria monitoring in Cote d'Ivoire
SO ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB Despite efforts to eliminate it, malaria remains a major public health concern, particularly in Cote d'Ivoire. Chloroquine (CQ) was one of the first drugs used for its treatment, but was officially withdrawn from the market in 2007 following reports of high levels of chloroquine resistance. The present study was carried out after the withdrawal of CQ and provides an update on the rates of CQ resistance in Cote d'Ivoire. Samples were collected between September 2013 and March 2014 in Abidjan and from January to May 2016 in Abengourou and San Pedro through cross-sectional studies. Parasitemia was assessed by microscopy, and single nucleotide polymorphism in the Pfcrt (codon 76) gene was analyzed by nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of 343 samples were analyzed: 119, 106 and 118 were from Abidjan, Abengourou, and San Pedro, respectively. The sex ratio of patients was 0.92. The mean age of patients enrolled was 9.6 years (SD = 10.8). The geometric mean of parasite density was 21,337 parasites/L (SD = 49,508; range, 2,000-200,000). Molecular analysis revealed 57 K76T mutants (16.6%): 33, 9, and 15 in Abidjan, Abengourou and in San Pedro, respectively. Most of these were found in patients aged 15 years (42/57) who had parasitemia greater than 10,000 parasites/L (40/57). This is the first study conducted in Cote d'Ivoire reporting a decline in Pfcrt K76T mutation rate. Thus, our results indicate the importance of following up on the observed trend also at a national level.

TI High-sensitivity detection of human malaria parasites by the use of
   rapid diagnostic tests and nested polymerase chain reaction in burdened
   communities of North East India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Background and Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of malaria through microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) analysis performed locally and the accuracy evaluated by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum from hotspot regions of North East (NE) India. Materials and Methods: One thousand one hundred and seventy-three blood samples were collected for identification of P. falciparum infection using microscopy and RDT analysis. DNA was extracted from whole blood using QIAamp DNA blood mini kit, and nested PCR was performed to confirm P. falciparum for evaluating sensitivity and specificity from various epidemiological surveys and geographical areas of NE India. Results: Of 1173 symptomatic malaria suspected patients, 15.6% (183/1173) patients were diagnosed as malaria positive by RDT and 67.94% cases (53/78) with microscopy. Of 183 malaria-positive patients, 42.62% (78/183) were diagnosed with P. falciparum and 84.61% (66/78) further confirmed to be P. falciparum positive by nested PCR. High sensitivity (97.9%) and low specificity (2.03%) of the RDT and high sensitivity (99.1%) and low specificity (0.9%) in microscopy against nested PCR results was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Epidemiological comparisons expressed highest incidences in Manipur (51.11%) followed by Meghalaya (48.93%) and Assam (35.16%). Overall incidence rate among the genders was observed to be higher in males than in females. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PCR, RDT and microscopy can potentially determine hotspots at moderate transmission intensities, but PCR testing has a diagnostic advantage as transmission intensity falls. Therefore, malaria control programs should consider PCR testing when the prevalence of infection is low.

TI Comparative Assessment of Diagnostic Performances of Two Commercial
   Rapid Diagnostic Test Kits for Detection of Plasmodium spp. in Ugandan
   Patients with Malaria
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Prompt diagnosis of malaria cases with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has been widely adopted as an effective malaria diagnostic tool in many malaria endemic countries, primarily due to their easy operation, fast result output, and straightforward interpretation. However, there has been controversy about the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs. This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performances of the 2 commercially available malaria RDT kits, RapiGEN Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (pLDH/pLDH) and Asan EasyTest (TM) Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (HRP-2/pLDH) for their abilities to detect Plasmodium species in blood samples collected from Ugandan patients with malaria. To evaluate the diagnostic performances of these 2 RDT kits, 229 blood samples were tested for malaria infection by microscopic examination and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection sensitivities for P. falciparum of Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (pLDH/pLDH) and Asan EasyTest (TM) Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (HRP-2/pLDH) were 87.83% and 89.57%, respectively. The specificities of the 2 RDTs were 100% for P. falciparum and mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections. These results suggest that the 2 RDT kits showed reasonable levels of diagnostic performances for detection of the malaria parasites from Ugandan patients. However, neither kit could effectively detect P. falciparum infections with low parasitaemia (< 500 parasites/mu l).

TI Screening and identification of potential novel biomarker for diagnosis
   of complicated Plasmodium vivax malaria
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: In the recent years Plasmodium vivax has been reported to cause severe infections associated with mortality. Clinical evaluation has limited accuracy for the early identification of the patients progressing towards the fatal condition. Researchers have tried to identify the serum and the plasma-based indicators of the severe malaria. Discovery of MicroRNA (miRNA) has opened up an era of identification of early biomarkers for various infectious and non-infectious diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are the small non-coding RNA molecules of length 19-24 nts and are responsible for the regulation of the majority of human gene expressions at post transcriptional level.
   Methods: We identified the differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray and validated the selected miRNAs by qRT-PCR. We assessed the diagnostic potential of these up-regulated miRNAs for complicated P. vivax malaria. Futher, the bioinformtic analysis was performed to construct protein-protein and mRNA-miRNA networks to identify highly regulated miRNA.
   Results: In the present study, utility of miRNA as potential biomarker of complicated P. vivax malaria was explored. A total of 276 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed by miRNA microarray and out of which 5 miRNAs (hsa-miR-7977, hsa-miR-28-3p, hsa-miR-378-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p and hsa-miR-3667-5p) were found to be significantly up-regulated in complicated P. vivax malaria patients using qRT-PCR. The diagnostic potential of these 5 miRNAs were found to be significant with sensitivity and specificity of 60-71% and 69-81% respectively and area under curve (AUC) of 0.7 (p <0.05). Moreover, in silico analysis of the common targets of up-regulated miRNAs revealed UBA52 and hsa-miR-7977 as majorly regulated hubs in the PPI and mRNA-miRNA networks, suggesting their putative role in complicated P. vivax malaria.
   Conclusion: miR-7977 might act as a potential biomarker for differentiating complicated P. vivax malaria from uncomplicated type. The elevated levels of miR-7977 may have a role to play in the disease pathology through UBA52 or TGF-beta signalling pathway.

TI A randomized trial of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus
   artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
   falciparum malaria in Mali
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine are first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in many endemic countries, including Mali. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) is also an alternative first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy, but only few data are available on DHA-PQ efficacy in sub-Saharan Africa. The main aim of this study was to compare clinical efficacy of DHA-PQ versus AL, using the World Health Organization (WHO) 42-day in vivo protocol.
   Methods: The efficacy of three-dose regimens of DHA-PQ was compared to AL combination in a randomized, comparative open label trial using the WHO 42-day follow-up protocol from 2013 to 2015 in Doneguebougou and Torodo, Mali. The primary endpoint was to access the PCR-corrected Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Responses at day 28.
   Results: A total of 317 uncomplicated malaria patients were enrolled, with 159 in DHA-PQ arm and 158 in AL arm. The parasite positivity rate decreased from 68.4% (95% CI 60.5-75.5) on day 1 to 3.8% (95% CI 1.4-8.1) on day 2 for DHA-PQ and 79.8% (95% CI 72.3-85.7) on day 1 to 9.5% (95% CI 5.4-15.2) on day 2 for AL, (p = 0.04). There was a significant difference in the uncorrected ACPR between DHA-PQ and AL, both at 28-day and 42-day follow-up with 97.4% (95% CI 93.5-99.3) in DHA-PQ vs 84.5% (95% CI 77.8-89.8) in AL (p < 0.001) and 94.2% (95% CI 89.3-97.3) in DHA-PQ vs 73.4% (95% CI 65.7-80.2) in AL, respectively (p < 0.001). After molecular correction, there was no significant difference in ACPRc between DHA-PQ and AL, both at the 28-day and 42-day follow-up with 99.4% (95% CI 96.5-100) in DHA-PQ versus 98.1% (95% CI 94.5-99.6) in AL (p = 0.3) and 99.3% (95% CI 96.5-100) in DHA-PQ vs 97.4% (95% CI 93.5-99.3) in AL (p = 0.2). There was no significant difference between DHA-PQ and AL in QTc prolongation 12.1% vs 7%, respectively (p = 0.4).
   Conclusion: The results showed that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine were clinically efficacious on Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Mali.

TI Does it take three to tango? An unsuspected multimorbidity of CD8(+) T
   cell lymphoproliferative disorder, malaria, and EBV infection
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is known to cause acute and deadly complications. However, malaria can cause unforeseen pathologies due to its chronicity. It increases the risk of endemic Burkitt Lymphoma development by inducing DNA damage in germinal centre (GC) B cells, and leading higher frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells in GCs. EBV is well known for its tropism for B cells. However, less is known about EBV's interaction with T cells and its association with T cell lymphoma.
   Case presentation: A 43-year-old Sudanese male admitted to hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, a non-endemic country, with hyperpigmented painful skin rashes on his whole body. A complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear during admission revealed large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) with abnormally higher CD8 T cell numbers. Additional skin biopsy and pathology results were compatible with CD8(+) T cell lymphoproliferative disorder with skin involvement. Patient was treated and discharged. However, a pathologist noticed unusual structures in skin tissue samples. Careful evaluation of skin biopsy samples by polarized microscopy revealed birefringent crystalloid structures resembling malarial haemozoin mainly loaded in macrophages and giant histiocytes. After purification of DNA from the skin biopsy samples, nested PCR was performed for the detection of Plasmodium parasites and Plasmodium falciparum DNA was amplified. Because, the co-presence of EBV infection with malaria is a well-known aetiology of lymphoma, EBV-early RNA (EBER) transcripts were investigated in paraffin-embedded tissue samples and found to be positive in macrophage-like histiocytes.
   Conclusions: This is a unique case of malaria and EBV infection in a T-LGL lymphoma patient who presented in a non-endemic country. This case emphasizes the clinical importance of EBV monitoring in T-LGL patients with skin involvement. Notably, Plasmodium infection should be examined in patients from malaria endemic regions by pathological and molecular investigations.

TI Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
   for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In 2009, the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Department of Health adopted artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) as the first-and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria, respectively. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of both drugs following adoption of the new policy.
   Methods: Between June 2012 and September 2014, a therapeutic efficacy study was conducted in East Sepik and Milne Bay Provinces of PNG in accordance with the standard World Health Organization (WHO) protocol for surveillance of anti-malarial drug efficacy. Patients >= 6 months of age with microscopy confirmed Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax mono-infections were enrolled, treated with AL or DHA-PPQ, and followed up for 42 days. Study endpoints were adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on days 28 and 42. The in vitro efficacy of antimalarials and the prevalence of selected molecular markers of resistance were also determined.
   Results: A total of 274 P. falciparum and 70 P. vivax cases were enrolled. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR for P. falciparum was 98.1% (104/106) for AL and 100% (135/135) for DHA-PPQ. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR for P. vivax was 79.0% (15/19) for AL and 92.3% (36/39) for DHA-PPQ. Day 3 parasite clearance of P. falciparum was 99.2% with AL and 100% with DHA-PPQ. In vitro testing of 96 samples revealed low susceptibility to chloroquine (34% of samples above -IC50 threshold) but not to lumefantrine (0%). Molecular markers assessed in a sub-set of the study population indicated high rates of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum (pfcrt SVMNT: 94.2%, n = 104) and in P. vivax (pvmdr1 Y976F: 64.8%, n = 54).
   Conclusions: AL and DHA-PPQ were efficacious as first-and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria in PNG. Continued in vivo efficacy monitoring is warranted considering the threat of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs in the region and scale-up of artemisinin-based combination therapy in PNG.

TI Dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriage in pregnant women
   under intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
   in Benin
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, in particular in children and pregnant women. During pregnancy, Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells expressing VAR2CSA are selected from circulation by selective cytoadherence to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan receptors expressed in the placenta, leading to an increased susceptibility to malaria, long-lasting infections and poor pregnancy outcome. Partly because of these long-lasting infections, women were reported to have a higher density of gametocytes in their peripheral blood, and are considered as a potential reservoir for malaria transmission. To improve pregnancy outcome in areas of high malaria transmission, The WHO recommends intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) during antenatal care visits. The effect of IPTp-SP on gametocyte carriage in infected pregnant women was studied.
   Methods: The levels of transcription of three gametocytes stage-specific genes Pfs16 (expressed by sexually-committed ring stage parasites and fully matured gametocytes), Pfs25 (expressed by female mature gametocytes) and Pfs230 (expressed by male mature gametocytes) were assessed by real-time PCR in 50 P. falciparum infected women at early pregnancy (before implementation of IPTp-SP), and in 50 infected women at delivery. Sex ratios of male and female gametocytes were determined in these women to assess the effect of IPTp-SP on the gametocyte populations.
   Results: The data show that the three transcript types specific to Pfs16, Pfs25 and Pfs230 were detected in all samples, both at inclusion and delivery. Levels of Pfs25 and Pfs230 transcripts were higher at delivery than at inclusion (p = 0.042 and p = 0.003), while the opposite was observed for Pfs16 (p = 0.048). The ratio of male/female gametocyte transcript levels was higher at delivery than at inclusion (p = 0.018). Since a mixed gender late stage gametocyte culture was used as a positive control, male and female gametocytes could not be quantified in an absolute way in the samples. However, the amplification reliability of the Pfs25 and Pfs230 markers in the samples could be checked. A relative quantity of each type of Pfs transcript was, therefore, used to calculate the sex ratio proxy.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that IPTp-SP treatment contributes to modify the parasite populations' structure during pregnancy. In line with previous studies, we suggest that the continued use of SP in pregnant women as IPTp, despite having a beneficial effect on the pregnancy outcome, could be a risk factor for increased transmission. This reinforces the need for an alternative to the SP drug for malaria prevention during pregnancy.

TI Proportional decline of Anopheles quadriannulatus and increased
   contribution of An. arabiensis to the An. gambiae complex following
   introduction of indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl: an
   observational, retrospective secondary analysis of pre-existing data
   from south-east Zambia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Across most of sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex, comprising seven morphologically indistinguishable but behaviourally-diverse sibling species with ecologically-distinct environmental niches. Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis are the mostly widely distributed major malaria vectors within the complex, while An. quadriannulatus is sparsely distributed.
   Methods: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl (PM) was conducted four times between 2011 and 2017 in the Luangwa Valley, south-east Zambia. Anopheles mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors by several experiments with various objectives conducted in this study area from 2010 onwards. Indoor mosquito collection methods included human landing catches, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps and back pack aspirators. Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species level using taxonomic keys, and to molecular level by polymerase chain reaction. These multi-study data were collated so that time trends in the species composition of this complex could be assessed.
   Results: The proportion of indoor An. gambiae complex accounted for by An. quadriannulatus declined from 95.1% to 69.7% following two application PM-IRS rounds with an emulsifiable concentrate formulation from 2011 to 2013, while insecticidal net utilisation remained consistently high throughout that period. This trend continued after two further rounds of PM-IRS with a longer-lasting capsule suspension formulation in 2015 and 2016/2017, following which An. quadriannulatus accounted for only 4.5% of the complex. During the same time interval there was a correspondingly steady rise in the proportional contribution of An. arabiensis to the complex, from 3.9 to 95.1%, while the contribution of nominate An. gambiae remained stable at <= 0.9%.
   Conclusion: It seems likely that An. arabiensis is not only more behaviourally resilient against IRS than An. gambiae, but also than An. quadriannulatus populations exhibiting indoor-feeding, human-feeding and nocturnal behaviours that are unusual for this species. Routine, programmatic entomological monitoring of dynamic vector population guilds will be critical to guide effective selection and deployment of vector control interventions, including supplementary measures to tackle persisting vectors of residual malaria transmission like An. arabiensis.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection among pregnant women at
   first antenatal visit in post-Ebola Monrovia, Liberia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Disruption of malaria control strategies during the West African 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic led to an increase in malaria-attributable mortality. However, recent data on malaria infection in vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, are lacking in this post-Ebola scenario. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection and of molecular markers of drug resistance among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
   Methods: From October 2016 to June 2017, all pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the Saint Joseph's Catholic Hospital, Monrovia, were invited to participate in the study. In addition to their routine antenatal care tests, capillary blood spotted onto filter papers were collected from all consenting participants to determine presence of P. falciparum by real-time quantitative PCR. Molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance were assessed through Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR in specimens positive for P. falciparum analysis.
   Results: Of the 195 women participants, 24 (12.3%) were P. falciparum-positive by qPCR. Infected women tended to be more commonly primigravidae and younger than uninfected ones. Parasite densities were higher in primigravidae. Fever was more frequently detected among the infected women. No statistically significant association between P. falciparum infection and haemoglobin levels or insecticide-treated net use was found. While high prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance were detected, no molecular markers of artemisinin resistance were observed.
   Conclusion: Plasmodium falciparum infections are expected to occur in at least one in every eight women attending first ANC at private clinics in Monrovia and outside the peak of the rainy season. Young primigravidae are at increased risk of P. falciparum infection. Molecular analyses did not provide evidence of resistance to artemisinins among the P. falciparum isolates tested. Further epidemiological studies involving pregnant women are necessary to describe the risk of malaria in this highly susceptible group outside Monrovia, as well as to closely monitor the emergence of resistance to anti-malarials, as recommended by the Liberian National Malaria Control Programme.

TI Genetic polymorphism and natural selection of circumsporozoite surface
   protein in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) is one of the most extensively studied malaria vaccine candidates, but the genetic polymorphism of PfCSP within and among the global P. falciparum population raises concerns regarding the efficacy of a PfCSP-based vaccine efficacy. In this study, genetic diversity and natural selection of PfCSP in Myanmar as well as global P. falciparum were comprehensively analysed.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 51 P. falciparum infected Myanmar patients. Fifty-one full-length PfCSP genes were amplified from the blood samples through a nested polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a TA cloning vector, and then sequenced. Polymorphic characteristics and natural selection of Myanmar PfCSP were analysed using the DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP programs. Polymorphic diversity and natural selection in publicly available global PfCSP were also analysed.
   Results: The N-terminal and C-terminal non-repeat regions of Myanmar PfCSP showed limited genetic variations. A comparative analysis of the two regions in global PfCSP displayed similar patterns of low genetic diversity in global population, but substantial geographic differentiation was also observed. The most notable polymorphisms identified in the N-terminal region of global PfCSP were A98G and 19-amino acid length insertion in global population with different frequencies. Major polymorphic characters in the C-terminal region of Myanmar and global PfCSP were found in the Th2R and Th3R regions, where natural selection and recombination occurred. The central repeat region of Myanmar PfCSP was highly polymorphic, with differing numbers of repetitive repeat sequences NANP and NVDP. The numbers of the NANP repeats varied among global PfCSP, with the highest number of repeats seen in Asian and Oceanian PfCSP. Haplotype network analysis of global PfCSP revealed that global PfCSP clustered into 103 different haplotypes with geographically-separated populations.
   Conclusion: Myanmar and global PfCSP displayed genetic diversity. N-terminal and C-terminal non-repeat regions were relatively conserved, but the central repeat region displayed high levels of genetic polymorphism in Myanmar and global PfCSP. The observed geographic pattern of genetic differentiation and the points of evidence for natural selection and recombination suggest that the functional consequences of the polymorphism should be considered for developing a vaccine based on PfCSP.

TI Use of Capillary Blood Samples Leads to Higher Parasitemia Estimates and
   Higher Diagnostic Sensitivity of Microscopic and Molecular Diagnostics
   of Malaria Than Venous Blood Samples
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Diagnosis of malaria is usually based on samples of peripheral blood. However, it is unclear whether capillary ( CAP) or venous (VEN) blood samples provide better diagnostic performance. Quantitative differences of parasitemia between CAP and VEN blood and diagnostic performance characteristics were investigated.
   Methods. Patients were recruited between September 2015 and February 2016 in Gabon. Light microscopy and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measured parasitemia of paired CAP and VEN samples. CAP and VEN performance characteristics using microscopy were evaluated against a qPCR gold standard.
   Results. Microscopy revealed a median parasitemia of 495/mu L in CAP and 429/mu L in VEN samples, manifesting in a 16.6% (P = .04) higher CAP parasitemia compared with VEN parasitemia. Concordantly, in qPCR -0.278 (P = .006) cycles were required for signal detection in CAP samples. CAP sensitivity of microscopy relative to the gold standard was 81.5% vs VEN sensitivity of 73.4%, while specificities were 91%. CAP and VEN sensitivities dropped to 63.3% and 45.9%, respectively, for a subpopulation of low-level parasitemias, whereas specificities were 92%.
   Conclusions. CAP sampling leads to higher parasitemias compared to VEN sampling and improves diagnostic sensitivity. These findings may have important implications for routine diagnostics, research, and elimination campaigns of malaria.

TI Dramatic decreases of malaria transmission intensities in Ifakara,
   south-eastern Tanzania since early 2000s
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundOngoing epidemiological transitions across Africa are particularly evident in fast-growing towns, such as Ifakara in the Kilombero valley, south-eastern Tanzania. This town and its environs (population similar to 70,000) historically experienced moderate to high malaria transmission, mediated mostly by Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus. In early 2000s, malaria transmission [Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rate (PfEIR)] was estimated at similar to 30 infectious bites/person/year (ib/p/yr). This study assessed the PfEIR after 15years, during which there had been rapid urbanization and expanded use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs).MethodsRandomly-selected 110 households were sampled across Ifakara town and four adjacent wards. Mosquitoes were trapped nightly or monthly (June.2015-May.2016) using CDC-light-traps indoors, Suna((R)) traps outdoors and human landing catches (HLC) indoors and outdoors. All Anopheles mosquitoes were morphologically identified and analysed by ELISA for Plasmodium circumsporozoite proteins. Mosquito blood meals were identified using ELISA, and sub-samples of An. gambiae and An. funestus examined by PCR to distinguish morphologically-similar siblings. Insecticide resistance was assessed using WHO-susceptibility assays, and some Anopheles were dissected to examine ovariole tracheoles for parity.ResultsAfter 3572 trap-nights, one Plasmodium-infected Anopheles was found (an An. funestus caught outdoors in Katindiuka-ward by HLC), resulting in overall PfEIR of 0.102 ib/p/yr. Nearly 80% of malaria vectors were from Katindiuka and Mlabani wards. Anopheles gambiae densities were higher outdoors (64%) than indoors (36%), but no such difference was observed for An. funestus. All An. funestus and 75% of An. gambiae dissected were parous. Anopheles gambiae complex consisted entirely of Anopheles arabiensis, while An. funestus included 84.2% An. funestus s.s., 4.5% Anopheles rivulorum, 1.4% Anopheles leesoni and 9.9% with unamplified-DNA. Anopheles gambiae were susceptible to bendiocarb and malathion, but resistant to pyrethroids, DDT and pirimiphos-methyl. Most houses had brick walls and/or iron roofs (>90%), and 52% had screened windows.ConclusionMalaria transmission in Ifakara has decreased by > 99% since early-2000s, reaching levels nearly undetectable with current entomological methods. These declines are likely associated with ITNs use, urbanization and improved housing. Remaining risk is now mostly in peri-urban wards, but concerted efforts could further decrease local transmission. Parasitological surveys are required to assess actual prevalence, incidence and importation rates.

TI Can malaria rapid diagnostic tests by drug sellers under field
   conditions classify children 5years old or less with or without
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria? Comparison with nested PCR analysis
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) available as dipsticks or strips, are simple to perform, easily interpretable and do not require electricity nor infrastructural investment. Correct interpretation of and compliance with the RDT results is a challenge to drug sellers. Thus, drug seller interpretation of RDT strips was compared with laboratory scientist re-reading, and PCR analysis of Plasmodium DNA extracted from RDT nitrocellulose strips and fast transient analysis (FTA) cards. Malaria RDT cassettes were also assessed as a potential source of Plasmodium DNA.MethodsA total of 212 children aged between 2 and 60months, 199 of whom had complete records at two study drug shops in south western Uganda participated in the study. Duplicate 5L samples of capillary blood were picked from the 212 children, dispensed onto the sample well of the CareStart Pf-HRP2 RDT cassette and a FTA, Whatman 3MM filter paper in parallel. The RDT strip was interpreted by the drug seller within 15-20min, visually re-read centrally by laboratory scientist and from it; Plasmodium DNA was recovered and detected by PCR, and compared with FTA recovered P. falciparum DNA PCR detection.ResultsMalaria positive samples were 62/199 (31.2%, 95% CI 24.9, 38.3) by drug seller interpretation of RDT strip, 59/212 (27.8%, 95% CI 22.2, 34.3) by laboratory scientist, 55/212 (25.9%, 95% CI 20.0, 32.6) by RDT nitrocellulose strip PCR and 64/212 (30.2%, 95% CI 24.4, 37.7). The overall agreement between the drug seller interpretation and laboratory scientist re-reading of the RDT strip was 93.0% with kappa value of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75, 0.92). The drug seller compliance with the reported RDT results was 92.5%. The performance of the three diagnostic strategies compared with FTA-PCR as the gold standard had sensitivity between 76.6 and 86.9%, specificity above 90%, positive predictive values ranging from 79.0 to 89.8% and negative predictive values above 90%.ConclusionDrug sellers can use RDTs in field conditions and achieve acceptable accuracy for malaria diagnosis, and they comply with the RDT results. Plasmodium DNA can be recovered from RDT nitrocellulose strips even in the context of drug shops. Future malaria surveillance and diagnostic quality control studies with RDT cassette as a source of Plasmodium DNA are recommended.

TI Cluster-randomized trial of monthly malaria prophylaxis versus focused
   screening and treatment: a study protocol to define malaria elimination
   strategies in Cambodia
SO TRIALS
AB BackgroundMalaria remains a critical public health problem in Southeast Asia despite intensive containment efforts. The continued spread of multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has led to calls for malaria elimination on the Thai-Cambodian border. However, the optimal approach to elimination in difficult-to-reach border populations, such as the Military, remains unclear.Methods/designA two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled, open-label pilot study is being conducted in military personnel and their families at focal endemic areas on the Thai-Cambodian border. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and weekly primaquine for 12weeks compared with focused screening and treating (FSAT) following current Cambodian national treatment guidelines. Eight separate military encampments, making up approximately 1000 military personnel and their families, undergo randomization to the MMP or FSAT intervention for 3months, with an additional 3months' follow-up. In addition, each treatment cluster of military personnel and civilians is also randomly assigned to receive either permethrin- or sham (water)-treated clothing in single-blind fashion. The primary endpoint is risk reduction for malaria infection in geographically distinct military encampments based on their treatment strategy. Monthly malaria screening in both arms is done via microscopy, PCR, and rapid diagnostic testing to compare both the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic modalities to detect asymptomatic infection. Universal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency screening is done at entry, comparing the results from a commercially available rapid diagnostic test, the fluorescence spot test, and quantitative testing for accuracy and cost-effectiveness. The comparative safety of the interventions chosen is also being evaluated.DiscussionDespite the apparent urgency, the key operational elements of proposed malaria elimination strategies in Southeast Asian mobile and migrant populations, including the Military, have yet to be rigorously tested in a well-controlled clinical study. Here, we present a protocol for the primary evaluation of two treatment paradigms - monthly malaria prophylaxis and focused screening and treatment - to achieve malaria elimination in a Cambodian military population. We will also assess the feasibility and incremental benefit of outdoor-biting vector intervention - permethrin-treated clothing. In the process, we aim to define the cost-effectiveness of the inputs required for success including a responsive information system, skilled human resource and laboratory infrastructure requirements, and quality management. Despite being a relatively low transmission area, the complexities of multi-drug-resistant malaria and the movement of vulnerable populations require an approach that is not only technically sound, but simple enough to be achievable.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02653898.

TI Allele-Specific Isothermal Amplification Method Using Unmodified
   Self-Stabilizing Competitive Primers
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Rapid and specific detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to drug resistance in infectious diseases is crucial for accurate prognostics, therapeutics and disease management at point-of-care. Here, we present a novel amplification method and provide universal guidelines for the detection of SNPs at isothermal conditions. This method, called USS-sbLAMP, consists of SNP-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (sbLAMP) primers and unmodified self-stabilizing (USS) competitive primers that robustly delay or prevent unspecific amplification. Both sets of primers are incorporated into the same reaction mixture, but always targeting different alleles; one set specific to the wild type allele and the other to the mutant allele. The mechanism of action relies on thermodynamically favored hybridization of totally complementary primers, enabling allele-specific amplification. We successfully validate our method by detecting SNPs, C580Y and Y493H, in the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 gene that are responsible for resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies currently used globally in the treatment of malaria. USS-sbLAMP primers can efficiently discriminate between SNPs with high sensitivity (limit of detection of 5 x 10(1) copies per reaction), efficiency, specificity and rapidness (<35 min) with the capability of quantitative measurements for point-of-care diagnosis, treatment guidance, and epidemiological reporting of drug-resistance.

TI Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapy, and
   molecular markers for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance in Mainland
   Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundArtemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the first-line anti-malarial treatment of uncomplicated malaria in most malaria endemic countries, including Tanzania. Unfortunately, there have been reports of artemisinin resistance and ACT failure from South East Asia highlighting the need to monitor therapeutic efficacy of ACT in these countries as recommended by World Health Organization.MethodsOpen-label single arm studies in mainland Tanzania were conducted in nine sentinel sites in 2011, 2012 and 2015 to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether/lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ) using 28days follow-up and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHAPQ) using 42days follow-up. Mutations in the propeller domain of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene and amplification of the P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pm2) gene, associated with artemisinin and piperaquine (PQ) resistance, were also investigated.ResultsOf the 428 patients enrolled, 328 patients provided study endpoint. For AL, the PCR corrected per-protocol analysis showed adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) of 90.3% (n=28; 95% CI 74.2-98.0) in Kyela 2012, 95.7% (n=22; 95% CI 78.1-99.0) in Chamwino, 100% in Muheza (n=29; 95% CI 88.1-100), 100% in Nagaga (n=39; 95% CI 91.0-100) and Kyela 2015 (n=60; 95% CI 94.0-100). For ASAQ, PCR corrected ACPR of 98% (n=49; 95% CI 89.4-99.9) and 100% (n=25; 95% CI 86.3-100) were observed in 2011 in Ujiji and Kibaha, respectively. For DHAPQ, the ACPR was 100% (n=71; 95% CI 94.9-100). Of the 235 samples with genetic interpretable results, only 7 (3%) had non-synonymous k13 mutations. None of these are candidate or validated markers of artemisinin resistance and all patients carrying these alleles cleared the parasites on day 3. Of the DHAPQ group, 10% (3/29) of the samples with interpretable results had pm2 multiple copies and none of them was associated with treatment failure.ConclusionAll the tested ACT in mainland Tanzania were highly efficacious and none of validated k13 mutants associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. However, three isolates with multiple copy numbers of pm2 gene associated with PQ resistance among the limited samples tested successfully calls for further investigation.Trial registration Number ACTRN12615000159550.

TI Combination of PURE-DNA extraction and LAMP-DNA amplification methods
   for accurate malaria diagnosis on dried blood spots
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria is one of the most important parasitic infectious diseases for which almost half of the world's population is at risk. Although several diagnostic methods are now available to detect the infection, more sensitive and applicable tests are still required in the field. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is a DNA amplification tool in which the DNA amplification can be achieved by incubation at a stable temperature. A malaria detection kit based on this methodology has already been commercialized and is being used in some countries. The kit includes two reaction tubes: one targeting the common Plasmodium genus (Pan tube) and the other specifically targeting Plasmodium falciparum (Pf tube). In parallel, a simple DNA extraction method, the procedure for ultra rapid extraction (PURE), which can produce a DNA solution suitable for the LAMP reaction without the use of a centrifuge, has also become available. In this study, the sensitivity of the combination of the PURE and LAMP methods (PURE-LAMP) was evaluated with archived dried clinical blood samples of importedmalaria cases, including P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae.ResultsUsing a nested PCR as the reference, 117 samples including 46 P. falciparum, 7 P. vivax, 9 P. ovale, 4 P. malariae, and 51 negative cases were tested. The PURE-LAMP Pan correctly identified 64 of the 66 positives and the 51 negatives. Among the Pan-positive samples 45 P. falciparum were also detected with the PURE-LAMP Pf. The PURE-LAMP Pan and PURE-LAMP Pf had respective sensitivities of 96.96% (95% CI 89.47-99.63) and 97.82% (95% CI 88.47-99.94) and common specificity of 1.ConclusionThe PURE-LAMP system is accurate when used with dried blood spots and extendable to the field.

TI Whole genome sequencing and microsatellite analysis of the Plasmodium
   falciparum E5 NF54 strain show that the var, rifin and stevor gene
   families follow Mendelian inheritance
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum exhibits a high degree of inter-isolate genetic diversity in its variant surface antigen (VSA) families: P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1, repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) and subtelomeric variable open reading frame (STEVOR). The role of recombination for the generation of this diversity is a subject of ongoing research. Here the genome of E5, a sibling of the 3D7 genome strain is presented. Short and long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) techniques (Ilumina, Pacific Bioscience) and a set of 84 microsatellites (MS) were employed to characterize the 3D7 and non-3D7 parts of the E5 genome. This is the first time that VSA genes in sibling parasites were analysed with long read sequencing technology.ResultsOf the 5733 E5 genes only 278 genes, mostly var and rifin/stevor genes, had no orthologues in the 3D7 genome. WGS and MS analysis revealed that chromosomal crossovers occurred at a rate of 0-3 per chromosome. var, stevor and rifin genes were inherited within the respective non-3D7 or 3D7 chromosomal context. 54 of the 84 MS PCR fragments correctly identified the respective MS as 3D7- or non-3D7 and this correlated with var and rifin/stevor gene inheritance in the adjacent chromosomal regions. E5 had 61 var and 189 rifin/stevor genes. One large non-chromosomal recombination event resulted in a new var gene on chromosome 14. The remainder of the E5 3D7-type subtelomeric and central regions were identical to 3D7.ConclusionsThe data show that the rifin/stevor and var gene families represent the most diverse compartments of the P. falciparum genome but that the majority of var genes are inherited without alterations within their respective parental chromosomal context. Furthermore, MS genotyping with 54 MS can successfully distinguish between two sibling progeny of a natural P. falciparum cross and thus can be used to investigate identity by descent in field isolates.

TI Another challenge in malaria elimination efforts: the increase of
   malaria among adults after the implementation of long-lasting
   insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in Dielmo, Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) has led to an impressive decrease of malaria burden these recent years in Africa. However, some new challenges about the future of malaria control and elimination efforts have appeared. Among these challenges, the loss and-or-the only partial acquisition of anti-Plasmodium immunity among exposed populations lead to an increase of the age at risk of malaria. Indeed, older children and adults may become more vulnerable to malaria. Studies about malaria among adults seemed, therefore, important. This study investigated the evolution of malaria morbidity in adults of Dielmo (Senegal) before and after the implementation of LLINs.
   Methods: From August 2007 to July 2015, a longitudinal study involving adults above 15 years old was carried out in Dielmo, where ACT was introduced in June 2006 and LLINs in July 2008. In July 2011 and August 2014, all LLINs were renewed. The presence of each person in the village was monitored daily. Thick smears associated lately with rapid diagnosis test (RDT) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods were performed for all cases of fever. To assess malaria prevalence, thick smears and RDT were performed quarterly in all individuals. Malaria risks factors were assessed using negative binomial regression mixed-model based on person-trimester observations.
   Results: Malaria morbidity among adults has decreased significantly since the implementation of LLINs in Dielmo. However, malaria resurgences have occurred twice during the 7 years of LLINs use. During these malaria resurgences, the overall incidence of malaria among adults was similar to the incidence during the year before the implementation of LLINs (adjusted incidence rate ratio [95% CI] aIRR = 1.04 [0.66-1.64], p = 0.88 and aIRR = 1.16 [0.74-1.80], p = 0.52 during the first and the second malaria resurgence period, respectively). Younger adults were most vulnerable during these malaria upsurges as the incidence of malaria increased significantly among them (chi(2) = 5.2; p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Malaria among adults especially younger adults should deserve more attention in the areas where malaria was previously endemic as they became vulnerable probably because of the partial acquisition and-or-the loss of anti-Plasmodium relative immunity and the non regular use of LLINs.

TI Detection of foci of residual malaria transmission through reactive case
   detection in Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Sub-microscopic and asymptomatic infections could be bottlenecks to malaria elimination efforts in Ethiopia. This study determined the prevalence of malaria, and individual and household-level factors associated with Plasmodium infections obtained following detection of index cases in health facilities in Jimma Zone.
   Methods: Index malaria cases were passively detected and tracked in health facilities from June to November 2016. Moreover, family members of the index houses and neighbours located within approximately 200 m from the index houses were also screened for malaria.
   Results: A total of 39 index cases initiated the reactive case detection of 726 individuals in 116 households. Overall, the prevalence of malaria using microscopy and PCR was 4.0% and 8.96%, respectively. Seventeen (43.6%) of the index cases were from Doyo Yaya kebele, where parasite prevalence was higher. The majority of the malaria cases (90.74%) were asymptomatic. Fever (AOR = 12.68, 95% CI 3.34-48.18) and history of malaria in the preceding 1 year (AOR = 3.62, 95% CI 1.77-7.38) were significant individual-level factors associated with detection of Plasmodium infection. Moreover, living in index house (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.16-4.27), house with eave (AOR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.14-4.55), area of residence (AOR = 6.81, 95% CI 2.49-18.63) and family size (AOR = 3.35, 95% CI 1.53-7.33) were main household-level predictors for residual malaria transmission.
   Conclusion: The number of index cases per kebele may enhance RACD efforts to detect additional malaria cases in low transmission settings. Asymptomatic and sub-microscopic infections were high in the study area, which need new or improved surveillance tools for malaria elimination efforts.

TI Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in Ethiopia: absence
   of common African and Mediterranean allelic variants in a nationwide
   study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Building on the declining trend of malaria in Ethiopia, the Federal Ministry of Health aims to eliminate malaria by 2030. As Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are co-endemic in Ethiopia, the use of primaquine is indicated for both transmission interruption and radical cure, respectively. However, the limited knowledge of the local prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and its associated variants has hindered the use of primaquine.
   Methods: Some 11,138 dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected in 2011 as part of a national, household Malaria Indicator Survey, a multi-stage nationally representative survey of all malaria-endemic areas of Ethiopia. A randomly selected sub-set of 1414 DBS samples was successfully genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Considering the geographical position and ethnic mix of the country, three common variants: G6PD*A (A376G), G6PD*A- (G202A) and Mediterranean (C563T) were investigated.
   Results: Of the 1998 randomly selected individuals, 1429 (71.5%) DBS samples were genotyped and merged to the database, of which 53.5% were from females. G6PD*A (A376G) was the only genotype detected. No sample was positive for either G6PD*A- (G202A) or Mediterranean (C563T) variants. The prevalence of G6PD*A (A376G) was 8.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7-11.2] ranging from 12.2% in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' (95% CI 5.7-18.7) to none in Dire Dawa/Harari Region.
   Conclusion: The common G6PD*A- (G202A) or Mediterranean (C563T) variants were not observed in this nationwide study. The observed G6PD*A (A376G) mutation has little or no clinical significance. These findings supported the adoption of primaquine for P. falciparum transmission interruption and radical cure of P. vivax in Ethiopia. As the presence of other clinically important, less common variants cannot be ruled out, the implementation of radical cure will be accompanied by active haematological and adverse events monitoring in Ethiopia.

TI High proportions of pfhrp2 gene deletion and performance of HRP2-based
   rapid diagnostic test in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates of Odisha
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundWith the documentation of cases of falciparum malaria negative by rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), though at low frequency from natural isolates in a small pocket of Odisha, it became absolutely necessary to investigate the status of HRP-2 based RDT throughout the state and in different seasons of the year.MethodsSuspected individuals were screened for malaria infection by microscopy and RDT in 25/30 districts of Odisha, India. Discrepancies in results were confirmed by PCR. False negative RDT samples for Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection were evaluated for detection of HRP2 antigen in ELISA and genotyped for pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and their flanking genes. Multiplicity of infection was ascertained based on msp1 and msp2 genotyping and parasitaemia level was determined by microscopy.ResultsOf the total 1058 patients suspected for malaria, 384 were microscopically confirmed for P. falciparum mono-infection and RDT failure was observed in 58 samples at varying proportion in different regions of the state. The failure in detection was due to undetectable level of HRP-2. Although most of these samples were screened during rainy season (45/345), significantly high proportion (9/17) of RDT negative samples were obtained during the summer compared to rainy season (P=0.0002; OR=7.5). PCR genotyping of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 in RDT negative samples showed 38/58 (65.5) samples to be pfhrp2 negative and 24/58 (41.4) to be pfhrp3 negative including dual negative in 17/58 (29.3). Most of the RDT negative samples (39/58) were with single genotype infection and high proportions of pfhrp2 deletion (7/9) was observed in summer. No difference in parasitaemia level was observed between RDT positive and RDT negative patients.ConclusionHigh prevalence of parasites with pfhrp2 deletion including dual deletions (pfhrp2 and pfhrp3) is a serious cause of concern, as these patients could not be given a correct diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, HRP2-based RDT for diagnosing P. falciparum infection in Odisha is non-reliable and must be performed in addition to or replaced by other appropriate diagnostic tools for clinical management of the disease.

TI No polymorphisms in K13-propeller gene associated with artemisinin
   resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolated from Brazzaville, Republic
   of Congo
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB BackgroundIn the Republic of Congo, artemisinin-based combinations have been recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria since 2006. However, the emergence of resistant parasites again these combinations in Southeast Asia is a threat for the control of this disease, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the weight of the disease is important. Indeed, polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum K13-propeller gene have been involved in variations of drug sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin-based combinations. The aim of the current study is to determine the prevalence of mutations of this gene in isolates collected in three health centers in Brazzaville.MethodsFrom May 2015 to May 2016, a total of 131, 259 and 416 samples from patients with suspected malaria were collected at the Laboratoire National de Sante Publique, Hopital de Mfilou, and the CSI << Maman Mbouale >> respectively. After DNA isolation, genotyping and sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum K13-propeller were performed in positive Plasmodium falciparum isolates identified after msp-2 gene genotyping.ResultsAll 806 samples collected were msp-2 genotyped and Plasmodium falciparum infections were confirmed in 287 samples with 43, 85, 159 samples from Laboratoire National de Sante Publique, Hopital de Mfilou, and the CSI << Maman Mbouale >> respectively. Of these 287 msp-2 positives samples, K13-propeller nested PCR products were successfully obtained from 145 (50.52%) isolates and sequences were generated from 127(87.58%) nested products. None of mutations that were associated with ACTs resistance in Southeast Asia were detected on the samples from three different study sites from Brazzaville. However, one mutation type was observed at position 578, where alanine was substituted by serine (A578S) in two isolates (1.57%, 2/127), those from the Hopital de Mfilou. No mutation was found in isolates from the two other sites.ConclusionThe current study shows a very limited polymorphism in the K13-propeller gene in isolates from the Republic of Congo and K13 polymorphisms associate with ACT resistance are not present in this country. However, permanent and large surveillance of resistant parasite population using K13-propeller gene is recommended.

TI Prospective comparative multi-centre study on imported Plasmodium ovale
   wallikeri and Plasmodium ovale curtisi infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundFew previous retrospective studies suggest that Plasmodium ovale wallikeri seems to have a longer latency period and produces deeper thrombocytopaenia than Plasmodium ovale curtisi. Prospective studies were warranted to better assess interspecies differences.MethodsPatients with imported P. ovale spp. infection diagnosed by thick or thin film, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were recruited between March 2014 and May 2017. All were confirmed by DNA isolation and classified as P. o. curtisi or P. o. wallikeri using partial sequencing of the ssrRNA gene. Epidemiological, analytical and clinical differences were analysed by statistical methods.ResultsA total of 79 samples (35 P. o. curtisi and 44 P. o. wallikeri) were correctly genotyped. Males predominate in wallikeri group (72.7%), whereas were 48.6% in curtisi group. Conversely, 74.3% of curtisi group were from patients of African ethnicity, whilst 52.3% of Caucasians were infected by P. o. wallikeri. After performing a multivariate analysis, more thrombocytopaenic patients (p=0.022), a lower number of platelets (p=0.015), a higher INR value (p=0.041), and shorter latency in Caucasians (p=0.034) were significantly seen in P. o. wallikeri. RDT sensitivity was 26.1% in P. o. curtisi and 42.4% in P. o. wallikeri. Nearly 20% of both species were diagnosed only by PCR. Total bilirubin over 3mg/dL was found in three wallikeri cases. Two patients with curtisi infection had haemoglobin under 7g/dL, one of them also with icterus. A wallikeri patient suffered from haemophagocytosis. Chemoprophylaxis failed in 14.8% and 35% of curtisi and wallikeri patients, respectively. All treated patients with various anti-malarials which included artesunate recovered. Diabetes mellitus was described in 5 patients (6.32%), 4 patients of wallikeri group and 1 curtisi.ConclusionsImported P. o. wallikeri infection may be more frequent in males and Caucasians. Malaria caused by P. o. wallikeri produces more thrombocytopaenia, a higher INR and shorter latency in Caucasians and suggests a more pathogenic species. Severe cases can be seen in both species. Chemoprophylaxis seems less effective in P. ovale spp. infection than in P. falciparum, but any anti-malarial drug is effective as initial treatment. Diabetes mellitus could be a risk factor for P. ovale spp. infection.

TI Negligible Impact of Mass Screening and Treatment on Mesoendemic Malaria
   Transmission at West Timor in Eastern Indonesia: A Cluster-Randomized
   Trial
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Mass screening and treatment (MST) aims to reduce malaria risk in communities by identifying and treating infected persons without regard to illness.
   Methods. A cluster-randomized trial evaluated malaria incidence with and without MST. Clusters were randomized to 3, 2, or no MST interventions: MST3, 6 clusters (156 households/670 individuals); MST2, 5 clusters (89 households/423 individuals); and MST0, 5 clusters (174 households/777 individuals). All clusters completed the study with 14 residents withdrawing. In a cohort of 324 schoolchildren (MST3, n = 124; MST2, n = 57; MST0, n = 143) negative by microscopy at enrollment, we evaluated the incidence density of malaria during 3 months of MST and 3 months following. The MST intervention involved community-wide expert malaria microscopic screening and standard therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and primaquine for glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase-normal subjects. All blood examinations included polymerase chain reaction assays, which did not guide on-site treatment.
   Results. The risk ratios for incidence density of microscopically patent malaria in MST3 or MST2 relative to that in MST0 clusters were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-1.91) and 1.22 (95% CI, .42-3.55), respectively. Similar results were obtained with molecular analysis and species-specific (P. falciparum and P. vivax) infections. Microscopically subpatent, untreated infections accounted for 72% of those infected.
   Conclusions. Two or 3 rounds of MST within 3 months did not impact the force of anopheline mosquito-borne infection in these communities. The high rate of untreated microscopically subpatent infections likely explains the observed poor impact.

TI The Malaria-Protective Human Glycophorin Structural Variant DUP4 Shows
   Somatic Mosaicism and Association with Hemoglobin Levels
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
AB Glycophorin A and glycophorin B are red blood cell surface proteins and are both receptors for the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which is the principal cause of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. DUP4 is a complex structural genomic variant that carries extra copies of a glycophorin A-glycophorin B fusion gene and has a dramatic effect on malaria risk by reducing the risk of severe malaria by up to 40%. Using fiber-FISH and Illumina sequencing, we validate the structural arrangement of the glycophorin locus in the DUP4 variant and reveal somatic variation in copy number of the glycophorin B-glycophorin A fusion gene. By developing a simple, specific, PCR-based assay for DUP4, we show that the DUP4 variant reaches a frequency of 13% in the population of a malaria-endemic village in southeastern Tanzania. We genotype a substantial proportion of that village and demonstrate an association of DUP4 genotype with hemoglobin levels, a phenotype related to malaria, using a family-based association test. Taken together, we show that DUP4 is a complex structural variant that may be susceptible to somatic variation and show that DUP4 is associated with a malarial-related phenotype in a longitudinally followed population.

TI Molecular detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
   prevalence in North Indian population
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Currently, malaria ranks as the 5th major cause of death in developing countries. There are six human malarial parasites species, with Plasmodium falciparum (Pt) and P. vivax (Pv) being the most predominant. This study enrolled 165 outpatients of a tertiary care hospital of the northeast district of Delhi. Blood samples were taken and were examined for malaria by slide microscopy and rapid malarial antigen detection test. DNA extraction was done and PCR was performed for genus as well as species identification. A total of 60 (36.36%) malaria positive samples were identified among a total of 165 samples collected. P. vivax and P. falciparum were found to be present in 51.66 and 13.33% samples, respectively and 18.33% samples were positive for both the species on the basis of PCR analysis. The present study suggests that while the traditional methods for diagnosis of malarial infection are gold standard they will not be able to detect mixed infections with low parasite count.

TI mRNA expression profiling in cotyledons reveals significant
   up-regulation of the two bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein genes
   boPAG-8 and boPAG-11 in early gestation
SO VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
AB The multigene family of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) belongs to a group of aspartic proteases that are exclusively expressed by trophoblast cells in the placenta of even-toed ungulates. In Bovidae, 22 different PAG genes (boPAGs) with a wide range of temporal and spatial expression- and glycosylation patterns have been reported to date. In this study we describe the mRNA expression patterns using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for selected modern (boPAG-1, -9, -21) and ancient bovine PAGs (boPAG-2, -8, -10, -11, -12) in cotyledonary tissue. The highest mean expression was detected in boPAG-8 and lowest in boPAG-10 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, boPAG-8 and -11 were significantly greater expressed in early gestation compared with later pregnancy stages. The characterization of boPAG mRNA-expression levels gives important insights for further protein analyses which will be valuable information for the development of new pregnancy detection systems.

TI Deciphering genetic regulation of CD14 by SP1 through characterization
   of peripheral blood mononuclear transcriptome of P. faiciparum and P.
   vivax infected malaria patients
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are two major parasites responsible for malaria which remains a threat to almost 50% of world's population despite decade-long eradication program. One possible reason behind this conundrum is that the bases of clinical variability in malaria caused by either species are complex and poorly understood.
   Methods: Whole-genome transcriptome was analyzed to identify the active and predominant pathways in the PBMC of P. falciparum and P. vivax infected malaria patients. Deregulated genes were identified and annotated using R Bioconductor and DAVID/KEGG respectively. Genetic and functional regulation of CD14, a prioritized candidate, were established by quantitative RT-PCR, genotyping using RFLP and resequencing, mapping of transcription factor binding using CONSITE and TFBIND, dual luciferase assay, western blot analysis, RNAi- mediated gene knockdown and chromatin-immunoprecipation.
   Findings: The study highlighted that deregulation of host immune and inflammatory genes particularly CD14 as a key event in P. falciparum malaria. An abundance of allele-C of rs5744454, located in CD14 promoter, in severe malaria motivated us to establish an allele-specific regulation of CD14 by SP1. An enhancement of SP1 and CD14 expression was observed in artemisinin treated human monocyte cell line.
   Interpretation: Our data not only reinstates that CD14 of TIR pathway plays a predominant role in P. falciparum malaria, it establishes a functional basis for genetic association of rs5744454 with P. falciparum severe malaria by demonstrating a cis-regulatory role of this promoter polymorphism. Moreover, the study points towards a novel pharmacogenetic aspect of artemisinin-based anti-malarial therapy. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Evaluation of malaria multiplex/nested PCR performance at low parasite
   densities and mixed infection in Iran: A country close to malaria
   elimination
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Background: Malaria is still a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria remains a challenge in most of the endemic areas. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of multiplex/nested PCR in detecting Plasmodium falciparum at low parasite densities and mixed infection.
   Methods: The study was performed in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of the southeastern Iran, from May 2015 to July 2016. A total of 105 patients suspected to malaria infection were enrolled in the study. The obtained DNA products, extracted from the thick/thin films, were analyzed by multiplex/nested PCR using genus-specific primers and compared with light microscopy.
   Results: 43 samples were confirmed to be infected by microscopic examination. Among 43 microscopically diagnosed P. falciparum cases, 11.4% (12/105) were confirmed by multiplex/nested PCR, 36.2% (38/105) were confirmed as P. vivax, 1.9% (2/105) had mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax. Among micro-scopynegative samples, 10 samples turned malaria-positive in nPCR. In multiplex/nested PCR, the rate of mixed infections was 8.6% (9/105). When compared to LM, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of multiplex/nested PCR were calculated to be 82.8, 91.5, 92.3 and 81.1%, respectively.
   Conclusion: In this study, we showed that microscopic examination of blood smears does not reliably distinguish Plasmodium species in the case of mixed infections. Therefore, it seems that multiplex/nested PCR is a good candidate for examining the presence of malaria parasites in clinically suspected but microscopically negative cases.

TI Characterization of the Catalytic Subunits of the RNA Exosome-like
   Complex in Plasmodium falciparum
SO JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB The eukaryotic ribonucleic acid (RNA) exosome is a versatile multiribonuclease complex that mediates the processing, surveillance, and degradation of virtually all classes of RNA in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The complex, composed of 10 to 11 subunits, has been widely described in many organisms. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that there may be also an exosome-like complex in Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite of great importance in public health, with eight predicted subunits having high sequence similarity to their counterparts in yeast and human. In this work, the putative RNA catalytic components, designated as PfRrp4, PfRrp41, PfDis3, and PfRrp6, were identified and systematically analyzed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analyses suggested that all of them were transcribed steadily throughout the asexual stage. The expression of these proteins was determined by Western blot, and their localization narrowed to the cytoplasm of the parasite by indirect immunofluorescence. The recombinant proteins of PfRrp41, PfDis3, and PfRrp6 exhibited catalytic activity for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), whereas PfRrp4 showed no processing activity of both ssRNA and dsRNA. The identification of these putative components of the RNA exosome complex opens up new perspectives for a deep understanding of RNA metabolism in the malarial parasite P. falciparum.

TI A new highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the
   detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in whole
   blood
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe detection of submicroscopic infections in low prevalence settings has become an increasingly important challenge for malaria elimination strategies. The current field rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria are inadequate to detect low-density infections. Therefore, there is a need to develop more sensitive field diagnostic tools. In parallel, a highly sensitive laboratory reference assay will be essential to evaluate new diagnostic tools. Recently, the highly sensitive Alere Malaria Ag P.f ELISA (HS ELISA) was developed to detect P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in clinical whole blood specimens. In this study, the analytical and clinical performance of the HS ELISA was determined using recombinant P. falciparum HRP2, P. falciparum native culture parasites, and archived highly pedigreed clinical whole blood specimens from Karen village, Myanmar and Nagongera, Uganda.ResultsThe HS ELISA has an analytical sensitivity of less than 25pg/mL and shows strong specificity for P. falciparum HRP2 when tested against P. falciparum native culture strains with pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions. Additionally, the Z-factor statistic of 0.862 indicates the HS ELISA as an excellent, reproducible assay, and the coefficients of variation for inter- and intra-plate testing, 11.76% and 2.51%, were acceptable. Against clinical whole blood specimens with concordant microscopic and PCR results, the HS ELISA showed 100% (95% CI 96.4-100) diagnostic sensitivity and 97.9% (95% CI 94.8-99.4) diagnostic specificity. For P. falciparum positive specimens with HRP2 concentrations below 400pg/mL, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% (95% CI 88.4-100) and 88.9% (95% CI 70.8-97.6), respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for all 352 samples were 100% (CI 95% 96-100%) and 97.3% (CI 95% 94-99%).ConclusionsThe HS ELISA is a robust and reproducible assay. The findings suggest that the HS ELISA may be a useful tool as an affordable reference assay for new ultra-sensitive HRP2-based RDTs.

TI Laboratory challenges of Plasmodium species identification in Aceh
   Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting with newly discovered
   P-knowlesi
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB The discovery of the life-threatening zoonotic infection Plasmodium knowlesi has added to the challenges of prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis and surveillance. In this study from Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting where P. knowlesi endemicity was not previously known, we report the laboratory investigation and difficulties encountered when using molecular detection methods for quality assurance of microscopically identified clinical cases. From 2014 to 2015, 20 (49%) P. falciparum, 16 (39%) P. vivax, 3 (7%) P. malariae, and 2 (5%) indeterminate species were identified by microscopy from four sentinel health facilities. At a provincial-level reference laboratory, loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP), a field-friendly molecular method, was performed and confirmed Plasmodium in all samples though further species-identification was limited by the unavailability of non-falciparum species-specific testing with the platform used. At a national reference laboratory, several molecular methods including nested PCR (nPCR) targeting the 18 small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA, nPCR targeting the cytochrome-b (cytb) gene, a P. knowlesi-specific nPCR, and finally sequencing, were necessary to ultimately classify the samples as: 19 (46%) P. knowlesi, 8 (20%) P. falciparum, 14 (34%) P. vivax. Microscopy was unable to identify or mis-classified up to 56% of confirmed cases, including all cases of P. knowlesi. With the nPCR methods targeting the four human-only species, P. knowlesi was missed (18S rRNA method) or showed cross-reactivity for P. vivax (cytb method). To facilitate diagnosis and management of potentially fatal P. knowlesi infection and surveillance for elimination of human-only malaria in Indonesia and other affected settings, new detection methods are needed for testing at the point-of-care and in local reference laboratories.

TI A highly multiplexed broad pathogen detection assay for infectious
   disease diagnostics
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Rapid pathogen identification during an acute febrile illness is a critical first step for providing appropriate clinical care and patient isolation. Primary screening using sensitive and specific assays, such as real-time PCR and ELISAs, can rapidly test for known circulating infectious diseases. If the initial testing is negative, potentially due to a lack of developed diagnostic assays or an incomplete understanding of the pathogens circulating within a geographic region, additional testing would be required including highly multiplexed assays and metagenomic next generation sequencing. To bridge the gap between rapid point of care diagnostics and sequencing, we developed a highly multiplexed assay designed to detect 164 different viruses, bacteria, and parasites using the NanoString nCounter platform. Included in this assay were high consequence pathogens such as Ebola virus, highly endemic organisms including several Plasmodium species, and a large number of less prevalent pathogens to ensure a broad coverage of potential human pathogens. Evaluation of this panel resulted in positive detection of 113 (encompassing 98 different human pathogen types) of the 126 organisms available to us including the medically important Ebola virus, Lassa virus, dengue virus serotypes 1-4, Chikungunya virus, yellow fever virus, and Plasmodium falciparum. Overall, this assay could improve infectious disease diagnostics and biosurveillance efforts as a quick, highly multiplexed, and easy to use pathogen screening tool.

TI The role of the BAFF/APRIL system in the T cell-independent specific
   response to blood stage Plasmodium falciparum hemozoin
SO CYTOKINE
AB Background: The B cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are tumor necrosis factor family members that regulate B cell maturation, proliferation, survival and function. We have previously shown that blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum hemozoin (HZ) can act as a T-independent antigen (TI Ag) that induces the production of specific IgG to soluble crude P. falciparum Ag through the BAFF pathway. However, we have not yet clarified whether HZ need APRIL signaling in the TI response. Here, we aimed to clarify whether both BAFF and APRIL signaling pathways play roles in HZ induction of specific antibody production without T-cell help.
   Methods: Normal monocytes alone or co-cultured with naive B cells were stimulated by HZ (10 mu M) in vitro. Naive B cell cultures, with HZ alone or with exogenous recombinant BAFF (rBAFF) and recombinant APRIL (rAPRIL) plus recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) for 6 and 10 days were used as controls to investigate activation of B cells. At various times, the levels of sBAFF, sAPRIL, and HZ-specific IgG in the culture supernatants were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The BAFF and APRIL expression levels on the HZ-stimulated monocytes and their specific receptors on activated B cells, including the BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), the transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), were determined by flow cytometry. mRNA expression levels for the receptors were validated using Real-Time quantitative PCR.
   Results: HZ-activated monocytes released sBAFF and sAPRIL during the 72 h stimulation period. Increased mRNA encoding of their cognate receptors, BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA, and increased HZ-specific IgG levels were also observed in HZ induction within the monocyte and B cell co-culture. The experiments under control conditions revealed that HZ alone could induce B cell culture to produce a small amount of the specific IgG compared with those in medium alone or rBAFF + rAPRIL + rIL-4.
   Conclusion: Taken together, we suggest that in the TI response HZ stimulates monocyte and B cell co-culture to produce specific IgG through BAFF, APRIL and other independent complimentary signaling pathways.

SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB BackgroundNeurological complications from malaria cause significant morbidity and mortality. Severe cerebral malaria occurs as a result of intense sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the cerebral capillaries. However, the pathology of the reversible neurological symptoms remains unclear. We report the case of a patient with malaria who also had mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) causing transient neurological symptoms.Case presentationA 55-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with acute fever upon returning from Nigeria. Blood smears and PCR analysis revealed ring forms in the erythrocytes, indicative of Plasmodium falciparum infection. He presented with dysarthria, expressive aphasia, and truncal ataxia, all of which were suggestive of cerebellar ataxia. He had no other signs or symptoms of severe malaria. Artemether/lumefantrine was started on the first day of illness. Although the parasites were undetectable on day 3 of illness, his neurological symptoms persisted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a high-signal lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted images along with a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient. The neurological symptoms gradually improved by day 12. Brain MRI on day 16 showed complete regression of the splenic lesion. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with MERS due to malaria.ConclusionsMERS often causes transient headaches, seizures, and/or impaired consciousness. The symptoms are compatible with the reversible symptoms of cerebral malaria.

TI Insights into malaria transmission among Anopheles funestus mosquitoes,
   Kenya
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundMost malaria vectors belong to species complexes. Sibling species often exhibit divergent behaviors dictating the measures that can be deployed effectively in their control. Despite the importance of the Anopheles funestus complex in malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, sibling species have rarely been identified in the past and their vectoring potential remains understudied.MethodsWe analyzed 1149 wild-caught An. funestus (senso lato) specimens from 21 sites in Kenya, covering the major malaria endemic areas including western, central and coastal areas. Indoor and outdoor collection tools were used targeting host-seeking and resting mosquitoes. The identity of sibling species, infection with malaria Plasmodium parasites, and the host blood meal sources of engorged specimens were analyzed using PCR-based and sequencing methods.ResultsThe most abundant sibling species collected in all study sites were Anopheles funestus (59.8%) and Anopheles rivulorum (32.4%) among the 1062 successfully amplified specimens of the An. funestus complex. Proportionally, An. funestus dominated in indoor collections whilst An. rivulorum dominated in outdoor collections. Other species identified were Anopheles leesoni (4.6%), Anopheles parensis (2.4%), Anopheles vaneedeni (0.1%) and for the first time in Kenya, Anopheles longipalpis C (0.7%). Anopheles funestus had an overall Plasmodium infection rate of 9.7% (62/636), predominantly Plasmodium falciparum (59), with two infected with Plasmodium ovale and one with Plasmodium malariae. There was no difference in the infection rate between indoor and outdoor collections. Out of 344 An. rivulorum, only one carried P. falciparum. We also detected P. falciparum infection in two non-blood-fed An. longipalpis C (2/7) which is the first record for this species in Kenya. The mean human blood indices for An. funestus and An. rivulorum were 68% (93/136) and 64% (45/70), respectively, with feeding tendencies on a broad host range including humans and domestic animals such as cow, goat, sheep, chicken and pig.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the importance of active surveillance through application of molecular approaches to unravel novel parasite-vector associations possibly contributed by cryptic species with important implications for effective malaria control and elimination.

TI Assessment of drug resistance associated genetic diversity in
   Mauritanian isolates of Plasmodium vivax reveals limited polymorphism
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium vivax is the predominant malaria species in northern Mauritania. Molecular data on P. vivax isolates circulating in West Africa are scarce. The present study analysed molecular markers associated with resistance to antifolates (Pvdhfr and Pvdhps), chloroquine (Pvmdr1), and artemisinin (Pvk12) in P. vivax isolates collected in two cities located in the Saharan zone of Mauritania.MethodsBlood samples were obtained from P. vivax-infected patients recruited for chloroquine therapeutic efficacy study in 2013 and febrile patients spontaneously consulting health facilities in Nouakchott and Atar in 2015-2016. Fragments of Pvdhfr (codons 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and 174), Pvdhps (codons 382, 383, 512, 553, and 585), Pvmdr1 (codons 976 and 1076) and Pvk12 (codon 552) genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced.ResultsMost of the isolates in Nouakchott (126/154, 81.8%) and Atar (44/45, 97.8%) carried the wild-type Pvdhfr allelic variant (IPFSTSI). In Nouakchott, all mutants (28/154; 18.2%) had double Pvdhfr mutations in positions 58 and 61 (allelic variant IPFRMSI), whereas in Atar only 1 isolate was mutant (S117N, allelic variant IPFSTNI). The wild-type Pvdhps allelic variant (SAKAV) was found in all tested isolates (Nouakchott, n=93; Atar, n=37). Few isolates in Nouakchott (5/115, 4.3%) and Atar (3/79, 3.8%) had the mutant Pvmdr1 allele 976F or 1076L, but not both, including in pre-treatment isolates obtained from patients treated successfully with chloroquine. All isolates (59 in Nouakchott and 48 in Atar) carried the wild-type V552 allele in Pvk12.ConclusionsPolymorphisms in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1, and Pvk12 were limited in P. vivax isolates collected recently in Nouakchott and Atar. Compared to the isolates collected in Nouakchott in 2007-2009, there was no evidence for selection of mutants. The presence of one, but not both, of the two potential markers of chloroquine resistance in Pvmdr1 in pre-treatment isolates did not influence the clinical outcome, putting into question the role of Pvmdr1 mutant alleles 976F and 1076L in treatment failure. Molecular surveillance is an important component of P. vivax malaria control programme in the Saharan zone of Mauritania to predict possible emergence of drug-resistant parasites.

TI Limited genetic diversity of N-terminal of merozoite surface protein-1
   (MSP-1) in Plasmodium ovale curtisi and P-ovale wallikeri imported from
   Africa to China
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundPlasmodium merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is released into the bloodstream during merozoite invasion, and thus represents a crucial malarial vaccine target. Although substantial research effort has been devoted to uncovering the genetic diversity of MSP-1 for P. falciparum and P. vivax, there is minimal information available regarding the genetic profiles and structure of P. ovale. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the extent of genetic variation among two subspecies of P. ovale by characterizing the MSP-1 N-terminal sequence at the nucleotide and protein levels.MethodsN-terminal of MSP-1 gene were amplified from 126 clinical samples collected from imported cases of malaria in migrant workers returning to Jiangsu Province from Africa using a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The PCR products were then sequenced and analyzed using the GeneDoc, MegAlign, MEGA7 and DnaSP v.6 programs.ResultsThe average pairwise nucleotide diversities () of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri MSP-1 genes (pomsp1) were 0.01043 and 0.01974, respectively, and the haplotype diversity (Hd) were 0.746 and 0.598, respectively. Most of the nucleotide substitutions detected were non-synonymous, indicating that the genetic variations of pomsp1 were maintained by positive diversifying selection, thereby suggesting their role as a potential target of a protective immune response. Amino acid substitutions of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri MSP-1 could be categorized into five and three unique amino acid variants, respectively.ConclusionsLow mutational diversity was observed in pomsp1 from the Jiangsu Province imported malaria cases; further studies will be developed such as immunogenicity and functional analysis.

TI Pre-clinical evaluation of a P. berghei-based whole-sporozoite malaria
   vaccine candidate
SO NPJ VACCINES
AB Whole-sporozoite vaccination/immunization induces high levels of protective immunity in both rodent models of malaria and in humans. Recently, we generated a transgenic line of the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei (Pb) that expresses the P. falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (PfCS), and showed that this parasite line (PbVac) was capable of (1) infecting and developing in human hepatocytes but not in human erythrocytes, and (2) inducing neutralizing antibodies against the human Pf parasite. Here, we analyzed PbVac in detail and developed tools necessary for its use in clinical studies. A microbiological contaminant-free Master Cell Bank of PbVac parasites was generated through a process of cyclic propagation and clonal expansion in mice and mosquitoes and was genetically characterized. A highly sensitive qRT-PCR-based method was established that enables PbVac parasite detection and quantification at low parasite densities in vivo. This method was employed in a biodistribution study in a rabbit model, revealing that the parasite is only present at the site of administration and in the liver up to 48 h post infection and is no longer detectable at any site 10 days after administration. An extensive toxicology investigation carried out in rabbits further showed the absence of PbVac-related toxicity. In vivo drug sensitivity assays employing rodent models of infection showed that both the liver and the blood stage forms of PbVac were completely eliminated by Malarone (R) treatment. Collectively, our pre-clinical safety assessment demonstrates that PbVac possesses all characteristics necessary to advance into clinical evaluation.

TI Molecular identification of Plasmodium species responsible for malaria
   reveals Plasmodium vivax isolates in Duffy negative individuals from
   southwestern Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria in Nigeria is principally due to Plasmodium falciparum and, to a lesser extent to Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. Plasmodium vivax is thought to be absent in Nigeria in particular and sub-Saharan Africa in general, due to the near fixation of the Duffy negative gene in this population. Nevertheless, there are frequent reports of P. vivax infection in Duffy negative individuals in the sub-region, including reports from two countries sharing border with Nigeria to the west (Republic of Benin) and east (Cameroon). Additionally, there were two cases of microscopic vivax-like malaria from Nigerian indigenous population. Hence molecular surveillance of the circulating Plasmodium species in two states (Lagos and Edo) of southwestern Nigeria was carried out.MethodsA cross-sectional survey between September 2016 and March 2017 was conducted. 436 febrile patients were included for the present work. Venous blood of these patients was subjected to RDT as well as microscopy. Further, parasite DNA was isolated from positive samples and PCR diagnostic was employed followed by direct sequencing of the 18S rRNA of Plasmodium species as well as sequencing of a portion of the promoter region of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines. Samples positive for P. vivax were re-amplified several times and finally using the High Fidelity Taq to rule out any bias introduced.ResultsOf the 256 (58.7%) amplifiable malaria parasite DNA, P. falciparum was, as expected, the major cause of infection, either alone 85.5% (219/256; 97 from Edo and 122 from Lagos), or mixed with P. malariae 6.3% (16/256) or with P. vivax 1.6% (4/256). Only one of the five P. vivax isolates was found to be a single infection. DNA sequencing and subsequent alignment of the 18S rRNA of P. vivax with the reference strains displayed very high similarities (100%). Remarkably, the T-33C was identified in all P. vivax samples, thus confirming that all vivax-infected patients in the current study are Duffy negative.ConclusionThe present study gave the first molecular evidence of P. vivax in Nigeria in Duffy negative individuals. Though restricted to two states; Edo in South-South and Lagos in South-west Nigeria, the real burden of this species in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa might have been underestimated, hence there is need to put in place a country-wide, as well as a sub-Saharan Africa-wide surveillance and appropriate control measures.

TI A multiplex assay for the sensitive detection and quantification of male
   and female Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe transmission of malaria to mosquitoes depends on the presence of gametocytes that circulate in the peripheral blood of infected human hosts. Sensitive estimates of the densities of female gametocytes (FG) and male gametocytes (MG) may allow the prediction of infectivity to mosquitoes and thus a molecular estimate of the human infectious reservoir for transmission.MethodsA novel multiplex qRT-PCR assay with intron-spanning primers was developed for the parallel quantification of FG and MG. CCp4 (PF3D7_0903800) transcripts specific for FG and PfMGET (PF3D7_1469900) transcripts specific for MG were quantified in total nucleic acids. The assay was validated on sex-sorted gametocytes from culture material and on samples from clinical trials with gametocytocidal drugs. Synthetic RNA standards were generated for the two targets genes and calibrated against known gametocyte quantities.ResultsThe limit of detection was determined at 0.1 male and 0.1 female gametocyte/mu L, which was equal to the limit of quantification (LOQ) for MG, while the LOQ for FG was 1FG/mu L. Results from previously reported clinical trials that used separate gametocyte qRT-PCR assays for FG (targeting Pfs25) and MG (targeting PfMGET) were reproduced with the multiplex assay. High levels of agreement between separate assays and the multiplex approach were observed (R-2=0.9473, 95% CI 0.9314-0.9632, for FG measured by transcript levels of Pfs25 in qRT-PCR or CCp4 in multiplex; R-2=0.8869, 95% CI 0.8541-0.9197, for MG measured by PfMGET in either single or multiplex qRT-PCR). FG and MG transcripts were detected in pure ring stage parasites at 10,000- and 100,000-fold reduced frequency for CCp4 and PfMGET, respectively. The CCp4 and PfMGET transcripts were equally stable under suboptimal storage conditions.ConclusionsGametocyte densities and their sex ratios can be determined in the presented one-step multiplex assay with higher throughput than single assays. The interpretation of low gametocyte densities at asexual parasite densities above 1000parasites/mu L requires caution to avoid false positive gametocyte signals from spurious transcript levels in ring stage parasites.

TI Characterization of Plasmodium knowlesi dihydrofolate
   reductase-thymidylate synthase and sensitivity to antifolates
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Malaria caused by an infection of Plasmodium knowlesi can result in high parasitemia and deaths. Therefore, effective and prompt treatment is necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality. The study aims to characterize P. knowlesi dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase enzyme (PkDHFR-TS) and its sensitivity to antifolates. The putative Pkdhfr gene was PCR amplified from field isolates collected from the Southern Thailand. Molecular analysis showed 11 polymorphisms in the dhfr domain of the bifunctional dhfr-ts gene. Of these, 1 polymorphism was a non-synonymous substitution (R34L) that had previously been reported but not associated with antifolate resistance. The recombinant PkDHFR-TS enzyme was found to be sensitive to standard antifolates-pyrimethamine and cycloguanil-as well as P218, a registered candidate drug currently first in human clinical trial. Results suggest that antifolates class of compounds should be effective against P. knowlesi infection.

TI Multiplex real-time PCR for diagnosing malaria in a non-endemic setting:
   a prospective comparison to conventional methods
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Almost a decade ago our diagnostic laboratory implemented an in-house real-time PCR for the detection of Plasmodium DNA to diagnose malaria in parallel with conventional diagnostics, i.e., microscopy (thick and thin smears), quantitative buffy coat microscopy (QBC), and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Here we report our experiences and make a comparison between the different diagnostic procedures used in this non-endemic setting. All patients during the period February 2009-December 2017 suspected of malaria were prospectively tested at the moment of sample collection. Both PCR and conventional malaria diagnostics were carried out on a total of 839 specimens from 825 patients. In addition, three Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) patients were closely followed by real-time PCR and microscopy after treatment. Overall, 56 samples (55 patients) tested positive by real-time PCR, of which six were missed by microscopy and seven by QBC. RDT showed fairly good results in detecting Pf, whereas specificity was not optimal. RDT failed to detect 10 of 17 non-Pf PCR positive specimens. One Plasmodium malariae patient would have been missed if only conventional diagnostic tests had been used. The high sensitivity of the PCR was confirmed by the number of PCR positive, microscopy negative post-treatment samples. In conclusion, within our routine diagnostic setting, malaria real-time PCR not only showed a high level of agreement with the conventional methods used, but also showed higher sensitivity and better specificity. Still, for complete replacement of the conventional procedures in a non-endemic setting, the time-to-results of the real-time PCR is currently too long.

TI An Update on Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests
SO CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPORTS
AB Purpose of ReviewModern advances in malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) technology have increased demand for low-cost, easy-to-use assays in areas endemic for malaria. Substantial developments in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, improvements in non-falciparum RDTs, and novel biotechnological innovations are gradually aligning the performance of RDTs with reference-level diagnostics including PCR and expert microscopy gold standards.Recent FindingsTrends have emerged in recent malaria RDT literature: (1) improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis, making them comparable to expert microscopic examination; (2) reduced false-positive and false-negative reactions with novel antibody development; (3) improved sensitivity and specificity capabilities of Plasmodium vivax-specific RDTs; (4) developing RDTs for co-endemic mixed infection differentiation; (5) significant improvements of RDTs for Plasmodium knowlesi; (6) a global push towards assessing and confronting the growing concerns of widespread pfhrp2 gene deletions; and (7) original innovation in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) biotechnological RDT-like platforms that demonstrate promising performance characteristics for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. knowlesi infections.SummaryThe past 5years have been characterized by increasing demand for malaria RDTs, translating into meaningful improvements in performance and novel biotechnological innovation. Future work should facilitate the development of improved RDT platforms for Plasmodium ovale, P. knowlesi, and Plasmodium malariae, and surmount the issue of pfhrp2 gene deletions, while maintaining comparable performance to both PCR and expert microscopy reference standards.

TI PfHRP2-PfHRP3 diversity among Kenyan isolates and comparative evaluation
   of PfHRP2/pLDH malaria RDT with microscopy and nested PCR methodologies
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are valuable tools that support prudent and timely use of antimalarial drugs, particularly if reliable microscopy is not available. However, the performance and reliability of these tests vary between and within geographical regions. The present study evaluated the performance of routine malaria RDT in Kenyan febrile patients in Busia County, Kenya. A cross sectional study design was employed to recruit febrile patients attending health facilities between August and November 2016. A total of 192 febrile patients who were slide positive and negative were evaluated for their infection status by nested PCR and RDTs (PfI-IRP2/pLDH). In addition, P. falciparum diversity of the histidine-rich proteins 2 and 3, that influences the RDT test results were determined. All individuals were P. falciparum positive. Among the investigated 192 febrile patients, 76 (40%) were positive by microscopy, 101 (53%) by RDTs and 80 (42%) were PCR positive. The performance of the CareStart (TM) HRP2/pLDH (pf) RDTs was better than microscopy (Sensitivity 94%; Specificity 75%) and Nucleic acid testing (sensitivity 95%, specificity 77%) with high negative predictive values, indicating the suitability of the RDT in routine practice. Specific pflup2/pfhrp3 deletions shown to associate with RDT false negativity was not observed. However, high genetic diversity among pflup2 gene was observed. Eleven new PfHRP2 and nine PfHRP3 repeats were observed. False positivity by microscopy and under reporting of infections may thus be a barrier in malaria control and elimination programs. The HRP2/pLDH(Pf) based RDT yet demonstrate to be an effective tool for malaria surveillance program.

TI Poor Diagnostic Performance of a Species-Specific Loop-Mediated
   Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Platform for Malaria
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: The objective of this study was to assess an in-house loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) platform for malaria parasite detection and identification on species level.
   Methods: LAMP primers specific for the human Plasmodium spp., namely, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi, as well as genus-specific primers, were tested against a composite gold standard comprising microscopy from thick and thin blood films, commercial genus-specific Meridian illumigene Malaria LAMP, in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and commercial fast-track diagnostics (FTD) Malaria differentiation PCR.
   Results: Of the 523 blood samples analyzed, the composite gold standard indicated 243 Plasmodium-species-DNA-containing samples (46.5%). Sensitivity and specificity of the analyzed genus-and species-specific LAMP primers were 71.0%-100.0% and 90.8%-100.0%, respectively. The influence of parasitemia was best documented for P. falciparum-specific LAMP with sensitivity values of 35.5% (22/62) for microscopically negative samples containing P. falciparum DNA, 50% (19/38) for parasitemia <= 50/mu L, 84% (21/25) for parasitemia <= 500/mu L, and 100% (92/92) for parasitemia >500/mu L.
   Conclusions: In our hands, performance characteristics of species-specific in-house LAMP for malaria lack reliability required for diagnostic laboratories. The use of the easy-to-apply technique for surveillance purposes may be considered.

TI Paraquat-Mediated Oxidative Stress in Anopheles gambiae Mosquitoes Is
   Regulated by An Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress Response
SO PROTEOMES
AB Paraquat is a potent superoxide (O-2(-))-inducing agent that is capable of inducing an oxidative imbalance in the mosquito midgut. This oxidative imbalance can super-stress the malaria parasite, leading to arrested development in the mosquito midgut and reduced transmission. While several studies have explored the effect of paraquat on malaria parasites, a fundamental understanding of the mosquito response to this compound remains unknown. Here, we quantified the mosquito midgut proteomic response to a paraquat-laced sugar meal, and found that An. gambiae midguts were enriched in proteins that are indicative of cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We also carried out qRT-PCR analyses for nine prominent thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH)-dependent genes in mosquito midguts post P. falciparum blood meal ingestion to evaluate the concordance between transcripts and proteins under different oxidative stress conditions. Our data revealed an absence of significant upregulation in the Trx and GSH-dependent genes following infected blood meal ingestion. These data suggest that the intrinsic tolerance of the mosquito midgut to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress is through an ER stress response. These data indicate that mosquitoes have at least two divergent pathways of managing the oxidative stress that is induced by exogenous compounds, and outline the potential application of paraquat-like drugs to act selectively against malaria parasite development in mosquito midguts, thereby blocking mosquito-to-human transmission.

TI Effectiveness of a Malaria Surveillance Strategy Based on Active Case
   Detection during High Transmission Season in the Peruvian Amazon
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Faced with the resurgence of malaria, malaria surveillance in the Peruvian Amazon incorporated consecutive active case detection (ACD) interventions using light microscopy (LM) as reactive measure in communities with an unusual high number of cases during high transmission season (HTS). We assessed the effectiveness in malaria detection of this local ACD-based strategy. Methods: A cohort study was conducted in June-July 2015 in Mazan, Loreto. Four consecutive ACD interventions at intervals of 10 days were conducted in four riverine communities (Gamitanacocha, Primero de Enero, Libertad and Urco Mirano). In each intervention, all inhabitants were visited at home, and finger-prick blood samples collected for immediate diagnosis by LM and on filter paper for later analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Effectiveness was calculated by dividing the number of malaria infections detected using LM by the number of malaria infections detected by delayed qPCR. Results: Most community inhabitants (88.1%, 822/933) were present in at least one of the four ACD interventions. A total of 451 infections were detected by qPCR in 446 participants (54.3% of total participants); five individuals had two infections. Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species (79.8%), followed by P. falciparum (15.3%) and P. vivax-P. falciparum co-infections (4.9%). Most qPCR-positive infections were asymptomatic (255/448, 56.9%). The ACD-strategy using LM had an effectiveness of 22.8% (detection of 103 of the total qPCR-positive infections). Children aged 5-14 years, and farming as main economic activity were associated with P. vivax infections. Conclusions: Although the ACD-strategy using LM increased the opportunity of detecting and treating malaria infections during HTS, the number of detected infections was considerably lower than the real burden of infections (those detected by qPCR).

TI Genetic polymorphism and natural selection in the C-terminal 42 kDa
   region of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) among Plasmodium knowlesi
   samples from Malaysia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) gene encodes for a leading malaria vaccine candidate antigen. However, its extensive polymorphic nature represents a major obstacle to the development of a protective vaccine. Previously, a pilot study was carried out to explore the sequence variation of the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment within P. knowlesi MSP-1 gene (PkMSP-1(42)) based on 12 clinical samples; however, further study on an adequate sample size is vital in estimating the genetic diversity of the parasite population.
   Methods: In the present study, we included a larger sample size of P. knowlesi (83 samples) covering eight states of Malaysia to determine the genetic polymorphism, natural selection and haplotype groups of the gene fragment coding PkMSP-1(42). The region flanking PkMSP-1(42) was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Genetic diversity, haplotype diversity, population genetic differentiation and natural selection were determined in order to study the polymorphic characteristic of PkMSP-1(42).
   Results: A high level of genetic diversity (Hd = 0.970 0.007; ? = 0.01079 +/- 0.00033) was observed among the 83 P. knowlesi samples, confirming the extensive genetic polymorphism exhibited among the P. knowlesi population found in Malaysia. A total of 18 distinct haplotypes with 17 amino acid changes were identified, whereby 15 were new haplotypes. High population differentiation values were observed within samples from Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. The 42 kDa fragments of P. knowlesi from Malaysian Borneo were found to be acting on balancing selection whilst purifying selection was suggested to act on isolates from Peninsular Malaysia. The separation of PkMSP-1(42) haplotypes into two main groups based on geographical separation has further supported the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi lineages.
   Conclusions: A high level of genetic diversity was observed among PkMSP-1(42) in Malaysia, whereby most of the polymorphisms were found within the 33 kDa region. Taken together, these data will be useful in order to understand the nature of P. knowlesi population in Malaysia as well as the design and development of a MSP-1(42) based knowlesi malaria vaccine.

TI Genetic diversity and allele frequencies of Plasmodium falciparum msp1
   and msp2 in parasite isolates from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria is still a serious public health problem on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), although the number of annual cases has been greatly reduced since 2004 through the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP). A better understanding of malaria parasite population diversity and transmission dynamics is critical for assessing the effectiveness of malaria control measures. The objective of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations and multiplicity of infection (MOI) on Bioko Island 7years after BIMCP.MethodsA total of 181 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria diagnosed with microscopy were collected from Bioko Island from January 2011 to December 2014. Parasite DNA was extracted using chelex-100 and species were identified using a real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting. Plasmodium falciparum msp1 and msp2 allelic families were determined using nested PCR.ResultsThree msp1 alleles (K1, MAD20, and RO33) and two msp2 alleles (FC27 and 3D7) were analysed in all samples. In msp1, the MAD20 allelic family was predominant with 96.69% (175/178) followed respectively by the K1 allelic family with 96.07% (171/178) and R033 allelic family with 70.78% (126/178). In msp2, the FC27 allelic family was the most frequently detected with 97.69% (169/173) compared to 3D7 with 72.25% (125/173). Twenty-six different alleles were observed in msp1 with 9 alleles for K1, 9 alleles for MAD20 and 8 alleles for R033. In msp2, 25 individual alleles were detected with 5 alleles for FC27 and 20 alleles for 3D7. The overall MOI was 5.51 with respectively 3.5 and 2.01 for msp1 and msp2. A significant increase in overall MOI was correlated with the age group of the patients (P=0.026) or parasite densities (P=0.04).ConclusionsThe present data showed high genetic diversity and MOI values among the P. falciparum population in the study, reflecting both the high endemic level and malaria transmission on Bioko Island. These data provide valuable information for surveillance of P. falciparum infection and for assessing the appropriateness of the current malarial control strategies in the endemic area.

TI A cluster randomised controlled trial of two rounds of mass drug
   administration in Zanzibar, a malaria pre-elimination settinghigh
   coverage and safety, but no significant impact on transmission
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB BackgroundMass drug administration (MDA) has the potential to interrupt malaria transmission and has been suggested as a tool for malaria elimination in low-endemic settings. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of two rounds of MDA in Zanzibar, a pre-elimination setting.MethodsA cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 16 areas considered as malaria hotspots, with an annual parasite index of >0.8%. The areas were randomised to eight intervention and eight control clusters. The intervention included two rounds of MDA with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and single low-dose primaquine 4weeks apart in May-June 2016. Primary and secondary outcomes were cumulative confirmed malaria case incidences 6months post-MDA and parasite prevalences determined by PCR 3months post-MDA. Additional outcomes included intervention coverage, treatment adherence, occurrence of adverse events, and cumulative incidences 3, 12, and 16months post-MDA.ResultsIntervention coverage was 91.0% (9959/10944) and 87.7% (9355/10666) in the first and second rounds, respectively; self-reported adherence was 82.0% (881/1136) and 93.7% (985/1196). Adverse events were reported in 11.6% (147/1268) and 3.2% (37/1143) of post-MDA survey respondents after both rounds respectively. No serious adverse event was reported. No difference in cumulative malaria case incidence was observed between the control and intervention arms 6months post-MDA (4.2 and 3.9 per 1000 population; p=0.94). Neither was there a difference in PCR-determined parasite prevalences 3months post-MDA (1.4% and 1.7%; OR=1.0, p=0.94), although having received at least the first MDA was associated with reduced odds of malaria infection (aOR=0.35; p=0.02). Among confirmed malaria cases at health facilities, 26.0% and 26.3% reported recent travel outside Zanzibar in the intervention and control shehias (aOR85; p0.001).ConclusionsMDA was implemented with high coverage, adherence, and tolerability. Despite this, no significant impact on transmission was observed. The findings suggest that two rounds of MDA in a single year may not be sufficient for a sustained impact on transmission in a pre-elimination setting, especially when the MDA impact is restricted by imported malaria. Importantly, this study adds to the limited evidence for the use of MDA in low transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02721186 (registration date: March 29, 2016)

TI Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Polymerase Chain
   Reaction (PCR) as quality assurance tools for Rapid Diagnostic Test
   (RDT) malaria diagnosis in Northern Namibia
SO PLOS ONE
AB Malaria cases sometimes go undetected using RDTs due to their inaccurate use, poor storage conditions and failure to detect low parasitaemia (<50parasites/mu L). This could result in continuous transmission of malaria and sustenance of parasite reservoirs. Molecular diagnostic tools are more sensitive and specific than RDTs in the detection of plasmodium parasites. However, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is not routinely used because equipment and reagents are expensive and requires highly skilled personnel. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a relatively new molecular diagnostic tool for malaria with all the advantages of PCR (sensitive and specific) without the mentioned disadvantages. However, it has not been evaluated extensively as a point of care diagnostic in the field. One hundred and fifteen used RDTs were collected from health facilities in Northern Namibia in a blind study and PCR and LAMP were used to determine the presence of Plasmodium DNA. The sensitivities and PPV were 40.91% and 90% respectively for RDTs, 72.73% and 100% respectively for PCR with LAMP as the golden standard. In low malaria transmission settings, LAMP can be also be considered for use as a surveillance tool to detect all sources of malaria and determine proportion of low parasitaemia infections in order to eliminate them.

TI Effectiveness of repellent delivered through village health volunteers
   on malaria incidence in villages in South-East Myanmar: a stepped-wedge
   cluster-randomised controlled trial protocol
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB BackgroundTo combat emerging drug resistance in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) the World Health Organization and GMS countries have committed to eliminating malaria in the region by 2030. The overall approach includes providing universal access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and sustainable preventive measures, including vector control. Topical repellents are an intervention that can be used to target residual malaria transmission not covered by long lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual spraying. Although there is strong evidence that topical repellents protect against mosquito bites, evidence is not well established for the effectiveness of repellents distributed as part of malaria control activities in protecting against episodes of malaria. A common approach to deliver malaria services is to assign Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) to villages, particularly where limited or no services exist. The proposed trial aims to provide evidence for the effectiveness of repellent distributed through VHVs in reducing malaria.MethodsThe study is an open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial randomised at the village level. Using this approach, repellent (N,N-diethyl-benzamide - 12% w/w, cream) is distributed by VHVs in villages sequentially throughout the malaria transmission season. Villages will be grouped into blocks, with blocks transitioned monthly from control (no repellent) to intervention states (to receive repellent) across 14 monthly intervals in random order). This follows a 4-week baseline period where all villages do not receive repellent. The primary endpoint is defined as the number of individuals positive for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections diagnosed by a rapid diagnostic test. Secondary endpoints include symptomatic malaria, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-detectable Plasmodium spp. infections, molecular markers of drug resistance and antibodies specific for Plasmodium spp. parasites.DiscussionThis study has been approved by relevant institutional ethics committees in Myanmar and Australia. Results will be disseminated through workshops, conferences and peer-reviewed publications. Findings will contribute to a better understanding of the optimal distribution mechanisms of repellent, context specific effectiveness and inform policy makers and implementers of malaria elimination programs in the GMS.Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616001434482).

TI Diagnostic capacity, and predictive values of rapid diagnostic tests for
   accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum in febrile children in
   Asante-Akim, Ghana
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThis study seeks to compare the performance of HRP2 (First Response) and pLDH/HRP2 (Combo) RDTs for falciparum malaria against microscopy and PCR in acutely ill febrile children at presentation and follow-up.MethodsThis is an interventional study that recruited children<5years who reported to health facilities with a history of fever within the past 72h or a documented axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees C. Using a longitudinal approach, recruitment and follow-up of participants was done between January and May 2012. Based on results of HRP2-RDT screening, the children were grouped into one of the following three categories: (1) tested positive for malaria using RDT and received anti-malarial treatment (group 1, n=85); (2) tested negative for malaria using RDT and were given anti-malarial treatment by the admitting physician (group 2, n=74); or, (3) tested negative for malaria using RDT and did not receive any anti-malarial treatment (group 3, n=101). Independent microscopy, PCR and Combo-RDT tests were done for each sample on day 0 and all follow-up days.ResultsMean age of the study participants was 22months and females accounted for nearly 50%. At the time of diagnosis, the mean body temperature was 37.9 degrees C (range 35-40.1 degrees C). Microscopic parasite density ranged between 300 and 99,500parasites/mu L. With microscopy as gold standard, the sensitivity of HRP2 and Combo-RDTs were 95.1 and 96.3%, respectively. The sensitivities, specificities and predictive values for RDTs were relatively higher in microscopy-defined malaria cases than in PCR positive-defined cases. On day 0, participants who initially tested negative for HRP2 were positive by microscopy (n=2), Combo (n=1) and PCR (n=17). On days 1 and 2, five of the children in this group (initially HRP2-negative) tested positive by PCR alone. On day 28, four patients who were originally HRP2-negative tested positive for microscopy (n=2), Combo (n=2) and PCR (n=4).ConclusionThe HRP2/pLDH RDTs showed comparable diagnostic accuracy in children presenting with an acute febrile illness to health facilities in a hard-to-reach rural area in Ghana. Nevertheless, discordant results recorded on day 0 and follow-up visits using the recommended RDTs means improved malaria diagnostic capability in malaria-endemic regions is necessary.

TI Challenging diagnosis of congenital malaria in non-endemic areas
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundCongenital malaria is usually defined as the detection of asexual forms of Plasmodium spp. in a blood sample of a neonate during perinatal age if there is no possibility of postpartum infection by a mosquito bite. The incidence of congenital malaria is highly variable and seems related to several factors, such as different diagnostic methods for Plasmodium spp. detection, and area in which the epidemiologic analyses are performed. In non-endemic countries, cases of congenital malaria are rare. Hereby, a case of a congenital malaria in an HIV exposed child is reported.Case presentationA 2-month-old male child was admitted to Bambino GesU Children's Hospital due to anaemia and exposure to HIV. He was born prematurely in Italy by cesarean section at 34weeks' gestation after a bicorial, biamniotic pregnancy by a migrant woman from Nigeria. He was the first of non-identical twins. Combined with anaemia, spleen and liver enlargement was noted, malaria was hypothesized. Malaria laboratory panel was performed on the newborn, mother and other twin blood samples, as follows: (i) malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT); (ii) Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears for Plasmodium spp. identification and parasitaemia titration; (iii) molecular screening and typing of Plasmodium spp. by multiplex qualitative PCR assay based on 18S rRNA gene. Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from mother and child was performed by neutral microsatellite and highly polymorphic marker amplification.ConclusionsThe maternal RDT sample was negative, while the infant RDT was positive; in both cases microscopy of blood smears and PCR showed infection with P. falciparum. Two of the genotypic molecular markers displayed different allelic variants between the two samples. This difference could imply infection multiplicity of the mother during the pregnancy, possibly harbouring more than one isolate, only one of them being transmitted to the newborn while the other persisting in the mother's blood. Because of the increasing number of pregnant women coming from endemic areas for malaria, an accurate anamnesis of infant's mother, and the inclusion of Plasmodium spp. research into TORCH screenings for mother-infant pair at birth, aiming at reducing morbidity and mortality associated to the disease might be suitable.

TI Persistent Plasmodium falciparum Infection in Women With an Intent to
   Become Pregnant as a Risk Factor for Pregnancy-associated Malaria
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Pregnant women are more susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum than before pregnancy, and infection has consequences for both mother and offspring. The World Health Organization recommends that pregnant woman in areas of transmission receive intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) starting in the second trimester. Consequently, women are not protected during the first trimester, although P. falciparum infections are both frequent and harmful.
   Methods. A cohort of nulligravid women was followed up during subsequent pregnancy. Malaria was diagnosed by means of microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Parasites were genotyped at polymorphic loci.
   Results. Among 275 nulligravidae enrolled, 68 women became pregnant and were followed up during pregnancy. Before pregnancy, P. falciparum prevalence rates were 15% by microscopy and 66% by polymerase chain reaction. Microscopic infection rates increased to 29% until IPTp administration, and their density increased by 20-fold. Conversely, submicroscopic infection rates decreased. After IPTp administration, all types of infections decreased, but they increased again late in pregnancy. The risk of infection during pregnancy was higher in women with a microscopic (odds ratio, 6.5; P = .047) or submicroscopic (3.06; P = .05) infection before pregnancy and was not related to the season of occurrence. Most infections during pregnancy were persistent infections acquired before pregnancy.
   Conclusions. Microscopic and submicroscopic malaria infections were frequent in nulligravid women from south Benin. During the first trimester of pregnancy, microscopic infections were more frequent, with a higher parasite density, and mainly derived from parasites infecting the woman before conception. Preventive strategies targeting nonpregnant women with a desire for conception need to be designed.

TI Prevalence of molecular markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and
   artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum from Pakistan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundIn Pakistan, artesunate (AS) in combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Monitoring molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance is crucial for early detection and containment of parasite resistance to treatment. Currently, no data are available on molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (K13 mutations) in P. falciparum isolates from Pakistan. In this study, the prevalence of mutations associated with SP and artemisinin resistance was estimated in different regions of Pakistan.MethodsA total of 845 blood samples that were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test were collected from January 2016 to February 2017 from 16 different sites in Pakistan. Of these samples, 300 were positive for P. falciparum by PCR. Polymorphisms in the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes were identified by pyrosequencing while polymorphisms in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene were identified by Sanger sequencing.ResultsThe prevalence of the PfDHFR 108N and 59R mutations was 100% and 98.8%, respectively, while the prevalence of PfDHFR 50R and 51I mutations was 8.6%. No mutation was observed at PfDHFR position 164. In PfDHPS, the prevalence ofmutations at positions 436, 437, and 613 was 9.9%, 45.2%, and 0.4%, respectively. No mutations were found at PfDHPS positions 540 and 581. The prevalence of double PfDHFR mutants (59R+108N) ranged from 93.8% to 100%, while the prevalence of parasites having the PfDHFR 59R+108N mutations in addition to the PfDHPS 437G mutation ranged from 9.5% to 83.3% across different regions of Pakistan. Nine non-synonymous and four synonymous mutations were observed in the PfK13 propeller domain, none of which correspond to mutations validated to contribute to artemisinin resistance.ConclusionThe absence of the highly resistant PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple mutant parasites and the lack of PfK13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance is consistent with AS+SP being effective in Pakistan.

TI Genetic association between the Pfk13 gene mutation and artemisinin
   resistance phenotype in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Yunnan
   Province, China
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe problem of anti-malarial drug resistance is a long-term challenge faced by malaria control in Yunnan Province. Recently, the detection rates of chloroquine-resistant molecular markers (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter, Pfcrt) and artemisinin-resistant molecular markers (P. falciparum kelch13 gene, ork13) were 85% and 35%, respectively. To understand the association of k13 gene mutation with artemisinin resistance in falciparum malaria cases, the difference in k13 gene differentiation between two populations and artemisinin resistance phenotype on falciparum malaria cases in Myanmar were analysed in this study.MethodsThis research involved all of falciparum malaria cases diagnosed continuously in Yunnan Province from 2013 to 2015 and some of falciparum malaria cases found in Lazar, Myanmar. Blood samples were taken from the former group for molecular epidemiological analysis of k13 gene mutations, and artemisinin resistance phenotypes of P. falciparum were observed in the latter group using the in vivo testing method recommended by the World Health Organization. Nested PCR was used to amplify the propeller domain of the k13 gene in P. falciparum, followed by sequencing.ResultsA total of 202 blood samples were collected from Yunnan Province and 382 blood samples were collected from falciparum malaria cases in Myanmar. 49 of 382 Myanmar cases were in vivo tested for artesunate resistance phenotype through full treatment course observation. At the same time, all the blood samples were screened for k13 gene mutation of P. falciparum. The genetic diversity of k13 was higher in the Plasmodium isolates from Yunnan Province than those from Myanmar cases. The genetic differentiation index of the two populations was 0.0410, where the intra- and inter-group variations were 95.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The odds ratio of artemisinin resistance phenotype and mutation at the locus 446 in k13 gene in Myanmar cases was 1.640, while the value was 1.840 based on the estimations of the mutations in the 12 loci.ConclusionAlthough the Plasmodium isolates from Yunnan Province and those from Myanmar were collected from different sites, they still belong to the same geographical population. It is, therefore, reasonable to contrast the artemisinin resistance status of the Plasmodium population from Myanmar with the Plasmodium population from Yunnan Province. As a result, based on the molecular epidemiological investigation on k13 mutations of Plasmodium isolates in Yunnan Province and the determination of the artemisinin resistance on falciparum malaria cases in Myanmar, the positively genetic correlated was found between the k13 locus mutations with artemisinin resistance phenotype. This provides a basis for further monitoring the artemisinin resistance by detection some molecular markers in k13 gene of Plasmodium in Yunnan Province.

TI Selecting better diagnostic kits for diagnosis of malarial parasites at
   point of care
SO 3 BIOTECH
AB Malaria is a fatal life-threatening parasitic infection and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate simple, inexpensive, accurate, reliable, easily available better diagnostic for rapid detection of malaria at point of care (POC). The study includes 1403 samples collected from the patients, of which 1227 were clinically suspected cases and 176 from consecutive feverish patients. Among the suspected cases only 338 samples were confirmed positive and 889 samples were negative for Plasmodium species by PCR. All the 889 samples showed negative result for plasmodium species by microscopy, Malarial Ag rapid kits but only 867 samples were confirmed negative with malarial Ab rapid kits. Of the 338 PCR positive samples, 337 samples were confirmed positive by microscopy and Malarial Ag rapid kits, but only 284 samples were confirmed positive using malarial Ab rapid kits. Overall the microscopy and the malaria antigen-based lateral flow assay exhibited similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and efficiency, respectively, whereas the PCR assay had 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and efficiency. But the evolutionary data for malaria antibody lateral flow assay has 92.81% sensitivity, 94.13% specificity, 84.02% PPV, 97.52% NPV and 93.80% efficiency. The developed Malaria pf/pv antigen and antibody field-deployable kits are simple, rapid, accurate, reliable, inexpensive, user friendly, POC. In addition the kits are highly sensitive and species-specific. The pf/pv antigen kit is found to be more accurate with 99.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity than to Malaria pf/pv antibody rapid kits. Of the two rapid kits developed, Malaria pf/pv antigen kit is found be more accurate with 99.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity than to Malaria pf/pv antibody rapid kits.

TI Chloroquine-Primaquine Therapeutic Efficacy, Safety, and Plasma Levels
   in Patients with Uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax Malaria in a Colombian
   Pacific Region
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB In Colombia, published studies for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria with chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) are scarce. The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of this combination. A clinical trial was performed in adults with uncomplicated P. vivax malaria using the 28-day World Health Organization validated protocol. Patients received supervised antimalarial treatment and the primary efficacy end point was the clinical and parasitological response. Safety was assessed through adverse events surveillance, and plasma levels of antimalarial drugs were measured. A total of 77 patients were included. Adequate clinical and parasitological response rate diagnosed by thick blood smear examination was achieved in 72 of 73 patients (98.6%) with a complete 28-day follow-up. There were two parasitological therapeutic failures (TFs) (2.9%) on day 28, established by polymerase chain reaction among 68 patients, one of them with a positive film. No adverse events were detected. After completing the antimalarial treatment, all patients reached adequate plasma concentrations of CQ and desethylchloroquine (DECQ), with medians of 302.9 and 104.0 ng/mL, respectively. Uncomplicated P. vivax malaria treatment with CQ-PQ standard treatment was effective and safe in the study population; TFs were not associated with low plasma levels of CQ and DECQ.

TI Simultaneous Quantification of Plasmodium Antigens and Host Factor
   C-Reactive Protein in Asymptomatic Individuals with Confirmed Malaria by
   Use of a Novel Multiplex Immunoassay
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) primarily detect Plasmodium falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and the malaria-conserved antigen lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for P. vivax and other malaria species. The performance of RDTs and their utility is dependent on circulating antigen concentration distributions in infected individuals in a population in which malaria is endemic and on the limit of detection of the RDT for the antigens. A multiplexed immunoassay for the quantification of HRP2, P. vivax LDH, and all-malaria LDH (pan LDH) was developed to accurately measure circulating antigen concentration and antigen distribution in a population with endemic malaria. The assay also measures C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as an indicator of inflammation. Validation was conducted with clinical specimens from 397 asymptomatic donors from Myanmar and Uganda, confirmed by PCR for infection, and from participants in induced blood-stage malaria challenge studies. The assay lower limits of detection for HRP2, pan LDH, P. vivax LDH, and CRP were 0.2 pg/ml, 9.3 pg/ml, 1.5 pg/ml, and 26.6 ng/ml, respectively. At thresholds for HRP2, pan LDH, and P. vivax LDH of 2.3 pg/ml, 47.8 pg/ml, and 75.1 pg/ml, respectively, and a specificity >= 98.5%, the sensitivities for ultrasensitive PCR-confirmed infections were 93.4%, 84.9%, and 48.9%, respectively. Plasmodium LDH (pLDH) concentration, in contrast to that of HRP2, correlated closely with parasite density. CRP levels were moderately higher in P. falciparum infections with confirmed antigenemia versus those in clinical specimens with no antigen. The 4-plex array is a sensitive tool for quantifying diagnostic antigens in malaria infections and supporting the evaluation of new ultrasensitive RDTs.

TI Plasmodium male gametocyte development and transmission are critically
   regulated by the two putative deadenylases of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB With relatively few known specific transcription factors to control the abundance of specific mRNAs, Plasmodium parasites may rely more on the regulation of transcript stability and turnover to provide sufficient gene regulation. Plasmodium transmission stages impose translational repression on specific transcripts in part to accomplish this. However, few proteins are known to participate in this process, and those that are characterized primarily affect female gametocytes. We have identified and characterized Plasmodium yoelii (Py) CCR4-1, a putative deadenylase, which plays a role in the development and activation of male gametocytes, regulates the abundance of specific mRNAs in gametocytes, and ultimately increases the efficiency of host-to-vector transmission. We find that when pyccr4-1 is deleted or its protein made catalytically inactive, there is a loss in the initial coordination of male gametocyte maturation and a reduction of parasite infectivity of the mosquito. Expression of only the N-terminal CAF1 domain of the essential CAF1 deadenylase leads to a similar phenotype. Comparative RNA-seq revealed that PyCCR4-1 affects transcripts important for transmission-related functions that are associated with male or female gametocytes, some of which directly associate with the immunoprecipitated complex. Finally, circular RT-PCR of one of the bound, dysregulated transcripts showed that deletion of the pyccr4-1 gene does not result in gross changes to its UTR or poly(A) tail length. We conclude that the two putative deadenylases of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex play critical and intertwined roles in gametocyte maturation and transmission.
   Author summary Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted during an infectious blood meal by anopheline mosquitoes. Transmission of the sexual stages of the parasite to mosquitoes requires the proper regulation of specific mRNAs. While much work has been done to characterize regulation of mRNAs in female gametocytes, little has been done to assess this regulation in male gametocytes. Here, we demonstrate that PyCCR4-1, a member of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT RNA metabolic complex, acts upon transcripts both directly and indirectly in gametocytes, and results in a reduction of male gametocytemia. In gametocytes lacking PyCCR4-1, as well as those expressing a catalytically dead variant, the initial coordinated wave of male gametocyte activation is lost, and these parasites are 4-fold less able to productively infect mosquitoes. We find that the deletion of the C-terminal portion of CAF1 in both Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum phenocopies the deletion of pyccr4-1. We also find that the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex is directly binding some of these transcripts and is likely acting both directly upon mRNAs and indirectly to modulate transcript abundance. These findings demonstrate that the combined effects of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex upon specific mRNAs are important for both male and female gametocytes, and that this regulation is required for efficient transmission to the mosquito vector.

TI Pyronaridine-artesunate for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum) malaria. Concerns about artemisinin resistance have led to global initiatives to develop new partner drugs to protect artemisinin derivatives in ACT. Pyronaridine-artesunate is a novel ACT.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy of pyronaridine-artesunate compared to alternative ACTs for treating people with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, and to evaluate the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate and other pyronaridine treatments compared to alternative treatments.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; and LILACS. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry for ongoing or recently completed trials. The date of the last search was 8 May 2018.
   Selection criteria
   Efficacy analysis: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pyronaridine-artesunate for treating uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.
   Safety analysis: RCTs of pyronaridine-artesunate or pyronaridine for treating P falciparum or P vivax malaria.
   Data collection and analysis
   For this update, two review authors independently re-extracted all data and assessed certainty of evidence. We meta-analysed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failures between comparisons, and for safety outcomes between and across comparisons.
   Main results
   We included 10 relevant studies. Seven studies were co-funded by Shin Poong Pharmaceuticals which manufactures the drug. Three studies were funded by government agencies.
   For efficacy analysis we identified five RCTs with 5711 participants. This included 4465 participants from 13 sites in Africa, and 1246 participants from five sites in Asia. It included 541 children aged less than five years.
   For polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted failures at day 28, pyronaridine-artesunate may have fewer failures compared to artemether-lumefantrine (RR 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.31; 4 RCTs, 3068 participants, low-certainty evidence), artesunate-amodiaquine (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.77; 1 RCT, 1245 participants, low-certainty evidence), and mefloquine plus artesunate (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 1117 participants, low-certainty evidence).
   For unadjusted failures at day 28, pyronaridine-artesunate may have fewer failures compared to artemether-lumefantrine (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58; 4 RCTs, 3149 participants, low-certainty evidence), and probably has fewer failures compared to artesunateamodiaquine (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81; 1 RCT, 1257 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and mefloquine plus artesunate (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78; 1 RCT, 1120 participants, moderate-certainty evidence).
   For PCR-adjusted failures at day 42, pyronaridine-artesunate may make little or no difference compared to artemether-lumefantrine (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 2575 participants, low-certainty evidence) and artesunate-amodiaquine (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.83; 1 RCT, 1091 participants, low-certainty evidence), but may have higher failures than mefloquine plus artesunate (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.57; 1 RCT, 1037 participants, low-certainty evidence). Overall, pyronaridine-artesunate had a PCR-adjusted treatment failure rate of less than 5%.
   For unadjusted failures at day 42, pyronaridine-artesunate may have fewer failures compared to artemether-lumefantrine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82; 4 RCTs, 3080 participants, low-certainty evidence), may make little or no difference compared to mefloquine plus artesunate (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 1059 participants, low-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference compared to artesunate-amodiaquine (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 1235 participants, moderate-certainty evidence).
   For the safety analysis of severe adverse events and liver function, we identified eight RCTs with 6614 participants comparing pyronaridine-artesunate to other antimalarials, four of which were not in the previous version of this review. A further two RCTs, comparing pyronaridine alone to other treatments, contributed to the synthesis of all adverse events.
   Raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than five times the upper limit of normal (>5 x ULN) ismore frequent with pyronaridine-artesunate compared to other antimalarials (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.63 to 6.84; 8 RCTS, 6581 participants, high-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference for raised bilirubin > 2.5 x ULN between pyronaridine-artesunate and other antimalarials (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.18; 7 RCTs, 6384 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). There was one reported case in which raised ALT occurred with raised bilirubin, meeting criteria for moderate drug-induced liver injury. No study reported severe drug-induced liver injury. Electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormalities were less common with pyronaridine-artesunate compared to other antimalarials. We identified no other safety concerns.
   Authors' conclusions
   Pyronaridine-artesunate was efficacious against uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, achieved a PCR-adjusted treatment failure rate of less than 5% at days 28 and 42, and may be at least as good as, or better than other marketed ACTs.
   Pyronaridine-artesunate increases the risk of episodes of raised ALT > 5 x ULN. This meets criteria for mild drug-induced liver injury. On one instance this was linked to raised bilirubin, indicating moderate drug-induced liver injury. No episodes of severe drug-induced liver injury were reported. The findings of this review cannot fully inform a risk-benefit assessment for an unselected population. Readers should remain aware of this uncertainty when considering use of pyronaridine-artesunate in patients with known or suspected pre-existing liver dysfunction, and when co-administering with other medications which may cause liver dysfunction.

TI Analytical validation of real-time quantitative PCR assays for optimum
   diagnosis of vivax malaria
SO MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB BACKGROUND The prompt diagnosis of plasmodia) species for effective treatment prevents worsening of individual health and avoids transmission maintenance or even malaria reintroduction in areas where Plasmodium does not exist. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows for the detection of parasites below the threshold of microscopic examination.
   OBJECTIVE Our aim was to develop a real-time PCR test to reduce diagnostic errors and increase efficacy.
   METHODS The lower limit of quantification and the linearity/analytical sensitivity to measure sensitivity or limit of detection (LoD) were determined. Intra-assay variations (repeatability) and alterations between assays, operators, and instruments (reproducibility) were also assessed to set precision.
   FINDINGS The linearity in SYBR (TM) Green and TaqMan (TM) systems was 10(6) and 10(2) copies and analytical sensitivity 1.13 and 1.17 copies/mu L, respectively. Real-time PCR was more sensitive than conventional PCR, showing a LoD of 0.01 parasite (p)/mu L. Reproducibility and repeatability (precision) were 100% for up to 0.1 p/mu L in SYBR (TM) Green and 1 p/mu L in TaqMan (TM) and conventional PCR.
   CONCLUSION Real-time PCR may replace conventional PCR in reference laboratories for P. vivax detection due to its rapidity. The TaqMan (TM) system is the most indicated when quantification assays are required. Performing tests in triplicate when diagnosing Plasmodium-infected-asymptomatic individuals is recommended to minimise diagnostic errors.

TI Clinical Implications of Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Infections
   in Malawi
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in Malawi; however, the implications of these infections for the burden of malaria illness are unknown. Whether asymptomatic infections eventually progress to malaria illness, persist without causing symptoms, or clear spontaneously remains undetermined. We identified asymptomatic infections and evaluated the associations between persistent asymptomatic infections and malaria illness.
   Methods. Children and adults (N = 120) who presented at a health facility with uncomplicated malaria were followed monthly for 2 years. During follow-up visits, participants with malaria symptoms were tested and, if positive, treated. Samples from all visits were tested for parasites using both microscopy and polymerase chain reaction, and all malaria infections underwent genotyping. Cox frailty models were used to estimate the temporal association between asymptomatic infections and malaria illness episodes. Mixed models were used to estimate the odds of clinical symptoms associated with new versus persistent infections.
   Results. Participants had a median follow-up time of 720 days. Asymptomatic infections were detected during 23% of visits. Persistent asymptomatic infections were associated with decreased risk of malaria illness in all ages (hazard ratio 0.50, P < .001). When asymptomatic infections preceded malaria illness, newly-acquired infections were detected at 92% of subsequent clinical episodes, independent of presence of persistent infections. Malaria illness among children was more likely due to newly-acquired infections (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.5) than to persistent infections.
   Conclusions. Asymptomatic P. falciparum infections are associated with decreased incidence of malaria illness, but do not protect against disease when new infection occurs.

TI Plasmodium ovale Malaria and Molecular Diagnosis: Could it be a Relapse?
SO MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB Malaria caused by Plasmodium species continues to affect the half of the world population. According to the World Health Organization 2017 data, 445.000 cases of malaria and 219 million cases of new clinical malaria cases were reported during the year. African continent is the geographical region where the disease is most frequent. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of imported cases after travels to this continent. In this case report, relaps caused by Plasmodium ovale in a male Republic of Turkey citizen patient who has travelled to Uganda only and no other place a year and half ago was presented. Thin blood smear was prepared from the peripheral blood of the patient who admitted to our hospital with complaints of fever and chills. The smear was stained with Giemsa and examined with a x100 objective microscope and trophozoites belonging to Plasmodium genus were detected. Considering the size and locality of the trophozoites in the erythrocytes, it is thought that the parasite may be Plasmodium vivax. Nested PCR method was used for the species identification. Nested PCR studies were performed using Plasmodium genus and specific primers for P.vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, P.ovale and Plasmodium malariae. Nested PCR products were run on gel and P.ovale was visualized in 787 bp region. P.vivax, P.malariae, P.falciparum, P.ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi species specific primers and probe-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRt-PCR) study revealed that the patient was infected with P.ovale. The patient had no history of chronic illness but had a history of recovered malaria 7-8 years ago. The patient did not have any complaints other than these complaints. CMV IgM and IgG and Brucella aglutinisation tests were negative. It is clear that relapse cases can also be seen when P.ovale species are in hypnozoite stage in the liver. Although there are 18 reported cases of relapse in the last century, these phenomena do not provide sufficient evidence for the theory of relapse. A true relapse is thought to be mild symptoms and even subclinical disease. It is also known that it is difficult to distinguish a true recurrence in cases of relapses that can occur after a long time from primer infection. The best way to overcome this difficulty is to assume being in a malaria endemic area or not between primary infection and recurrence. We think that the applications that are carried out together with the microscope and molecular studies, especially in cases where there is relapses in which low parasitemia or travel story are insufficient, are extremely important both in terms of diagnosis and accurate identification of species and in the selection of treatment.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium vivax associated Malaria and screening of
   positive isolates for pvmdr-1 gene
SO RAWAL MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objective: To determine true occurrence of Malaria in suspected cases and prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infection in Malaria positive patients through phenotypic and genotypic identification methods and to detect pvmdr1 gene to serve as baseline investigation to detect Chloroquine (CQ) resistance.
   Methodology: Samples were collected during peak period of Malaria transmission. Leishman staining technique was used to detect different morphological forms of Malarial parasites inside erythrocytes. DNA was isolated and PCR was done to detect presence of pvmdr1 gene in randomly selected P. vivax positive isolates.
   Results: Of 1210 samples, 858(70.9%) were males, majority (72.2%) were of age between 16 and 45 years and only 35 (2.9%) of age below 5 years. Of 1210 suspected samples, 143 (11.8%) were confirmed to have Malaria and 142 (99%) were positive for P. vivax malaria. PCR confirmed presence of pvmdr1 gene in tested isolates.
   Conclusion: Antimalarial medicines should be recommended only after confirmed diagnosis of malaria. Drugs other than Chloroquine (plus primaquine) should not be prescribed to P. vivax malaria patients. Gene analysis of pvmdr1 gene may provide early signal of emerging CQ resistance.

TI Plasmodium falciparum malarial parasites from Brazil lack artemisinin
   resistance-associated mutations in the kelch13 gene
SO REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB Introduction: Mutations in the propeller domain of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene are associated with artemisinin resistance. Methods: We developed a PCR protocol to sequence the pfk13 gene and determined its sequence in a batch of 50 samples collected from 2003 to 2016 in Brazil. Results: We identified 1 K189T substitution located outside the propeller domain of the PfK13 protein in 36% of samples. Conclusions: Although the sample size is relatively small, these results suggest that P. falciparum artemisinin-resistant mutants do not exist in Brazil, thereby supporting the continuation of current treatment programs based on artemisinin-based combination therapy.

TI Characteristics of Subpatent Malaria in a Pre-Elimination Setting in
   Southern Zambia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB To achieve and sustain malaria elimination, identification and treatment of the asymptomatic infectious reservoir is critical. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are frequently used to identify asymptomatic, Plasmodium-infected individuals through test-and-treat strategies, but their sensitivity is low when used in low transmission settings. Characteristics of individuals with subpatent (RDT-negative but polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive) Plasmodium parasitemia were evaluated in southern Zambia where malaria transmission has declined and efforts to achieve malaria elimination are underway. Simple random sampling based on satellite imagery was used to select households for participation in community-based, cross-sectional surveys between 2008 and 2013. Questionnaires were administered to collect information on age, gender, recent history of malaria symptoms, and recent antimalarial drug use. Blood samples were collected by finger prick for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 RDT, blood smears for microscopy, and dried blood spots for molecular analysis to detect malaria parasites and their sexual stage. Of 3,863 participants with complete data, 102 (2.6%) were positive by microscopy, RDT, or PCR. Of these, 48 (47%) had subpatent parasitemia. Most individuals with subpatent parasitemia were asymptomatic (85%). Compared with individuals without parasitemia, individuals with subpatent parasitemia were significantly more likely to be aged 5-25 years. Approximately one quarter (27%) of those with subpatent parasitemia had detectable gametocytemia. These findings suggest that strategies based on active or reactive case detection can identify asymptomatic individuals positive by RDT, but more sensitive diagnostic tests or focal drug administration may be necessary to target individuals with subpatent parasitemia to achieve malaria elimination.

TI The Controlled Human Malaria Infection Experience at the University of
   Maryland
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is a powerful tool to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccines and pharmacologics. Investigators at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Center for Vaccine Development (UMB-CVD) pioneered the technique in the 1970s and continue to advance the frontiers of CHMI research. We reviewed the records of 338 malaria-naive volunteers who underwent CHMI at UMB-CVD with Plasmodium falciparum from 1971 until 2017. These 338 volunteers underwent 387CHMIevents, including 60 via intradermal injection or direct venous inoculation (DVI) of purified, cryopreserved sporozoites. No volunteer suffered an unplanned hospitalization or required intravenous therapy related to CHMI. Median prepatency period was longer in challenges using NF54 (9 days) than in those using 7G8 (8 days), P= 0.0006 by the log-rank test. With dose optimization of DVI, the prepatent period did not differ between DVI and mosquito bite challenge (log-rank test, P = 0.66). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected P. falciparum infection 3 days earlier than thick smears (P < 0.001), and diagnosis by ultrasensitive PCRwas associated with less severe symptoms than smear-based diagnosis (39% versus 0%, P = 0.0003). Historical studies with NF54 showed a shorter median prepatency period of 10.3 days than more recent studies (median 11.0 days, P = 0.02) despite significantly lower salivary gland scores in earlier studies, P = 0.0001. The 47-year experience of CHMI at UMB-CVD has led to advancements in sporozoite delivery, diagnostics, and use of heterologous challenge. Additional studies on newchallenge strains and genomic data to reflect regional heterogeneity will help advance the use of CHMI as supporting data for vaccine licensure.

TI Use of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification in a Resource-Saving
   Strategy for Primary Malaria Screening in a Non-Endemic Setting
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Malaria is traditionally diagnosed by blood smear microscopy, which requires continuous resource-demanding training. In areas with only a few cases of malaria, a simple and rapid test that can reliably exclude malaria could significantly reduce the need for microscopy and training. We evaluated whether loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for screening malaria parasites could reduce the workload in the diagnosis of malaria. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification was used to analyze 38 ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples from 23 patients who had previously been tested for malaria by microscopy, antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (antigen-RDT), and in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The samples included blood with low-level parasitaemia and samples with discrepancies between the results of the different methods. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification detected malaria parasites in 27 of 28 samples that were positive according to in-house RT-PCR. There were negative microscopy results in 10 of these and negative antigen-RDT results in 11. The sample with a negative LAMP result and positive in-house RT-PCR result was from a patient who had recently been treated for low-level Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemia. We found LAMP to be reliable for malaria screening andsuitable for replacing microscopy without loss of performance. The low number of LAMP-positive samples needing microscopy can be handled by a limited number of trained microscopists. The time saved on training and documentation was estimated to be 520 working hours yearly in our laboratory. Using LAMP for primary screening of patient samples, we have made a diagnostic workflow that ensures more reliable, faster, and less resource-demanding diagnosis of malaria.

TI Plasmodium falciparum Gametocyte Enrichment in Peripheral Blood Samples
   by Magnetic Fractionation: Gametocyte Yields and Possibilities to Reuse
   Columns
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Gametocytes are sexual stage malaria parasites responsible for transmission to mosquitoes. Multiple gametocyte-producing clones may be present in natural infections, but the molecular characterization of gametocytes is challenging. Because of their magnetic properties, gametocyte enrichment can be achieved by magnetic fractionation. This increases detection sensitivity and allows specific genotyping of clones that contribute to malaria transmission. Here, we determined the percentage of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes successfully bound to magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) LS columns during magnetic fractionation and assessed whether columns can be reused without risking contamination or affecting column binding efficiency. Bound column fractions were quantified using multiplex quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for male (pfMGET) and female (CCp4) gametocytes and ring-stage asexual parasites (SBP1). To investigate cross contamination between columns, parasite strain identity was determined by merozoite surface protein 2 genotyping followed by capillary electrophoresis fragment sizing. A reproducible high percentage of gametocytes was bound to MACS LS columns with <5% gametocytes appearing in the flow-through and <0.6% asexual ring-stage parasites appearing in the gametocyte fraction. A high yield (>94%) of gametocyte enrichment was achieved when columns were used up to five times with lower binding success after eight times (79%). We observed no evidence for cross contamination between columns.

TI Asymptomatic Plasmodium infection in a residual malaria transmission
   area in the Atlantic Forest region: Implications for elimination
SO REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB Introduction: Elimination of malaria in areas of interrupted transmission warrants careful case assessment to avoid the reintroduction of this disease. Occasional malaria cases are reported among visitors of the Atlantic Forest area of Brazil, while data on residents of this area are scarce. Methods: A sectional study was carried out to examine 324 individuals living in a municipality where autochthonous cases were detected. Results: Asymptomatic Plasmodium infections were detected in 2.8% of the individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with one case of P. falciparum (0.3%), two cases of P. vivax (0.6%), and six cases of P. malariae (1.9%). The thick blood smears were negative in all individuals. Serological tests performed in 314 subjects were reactive in 11.1%, with 3.5% for P. falciparum and 7.7% for R. vivax. A subsample of 42 reactive individuals for any Plasmodium species showed R. malariae in 30.9% of specimens. Individuals who entered the Atlantic Forest region were 2.7 times more likely to exhibit reactive serology for P. vivax compared with individuals who did not enter this region (p<0.05). Children <15 years had a higher chance of reactive serology for P. falciparum and P. vivax than individuals >= 15 years of age (p<0.05). Individuals living in the Paraiso district had a higher chance of reactive serology for P. vivax compared to other districts (p<0.05). No associations were found between sex, past exposure to malaria, or serological response to antibodies of any Plasmodium species. Conclusions: The implications of these results for the elimination of malaria were discussed.

TI Association Between Age and Plasmodium falciparum Infection Dynamics
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Few data exist on the incidence or duration of natural Plasmodium falciparum infections in high-transmission settings. School-aged children (SAC) carry a disproportionate burden of infections, suggesting either increased incidence or increased duration. We estimated the incidence and duration of unique infections according to age groups. The Mfera Cohort Study (2014-2017) in Malawi had 2 years of follow-up, with 120 participants tested monthly and during sick visits. Blood samples were collected to detect P. falciparum by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples underwent genotyping. Simulation was used to account for high rates of nondetection of infection among low-parasitemia infections, which increase in frequency with age. Adults had significantly fewer unique infections per person per year (median, 2.5) compared with SAC and children younger than 5 years of age (6.3 and 6.6, respectively). Over half of all genotypes were persistent. Infections lasted significantly longer in adults (median, 180 days) and SAC (median, 163 days) compared with children younger than 5 years of age (median, 97 days), after accounting for age-dependent nondetection of infection. SAC acquired new infections at the same rate as children younger than 5 years, but they maintained these infections for longer periods of time, similar to adults. This study provides new insights into P. falciparum infection dynamics that should be considered when designing malaria control strategies.

TI The Search for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3
   Deletions in Zambia and Implications for Plasmodium falciparum
   histidine-rich protein 2-Based Rapid Diagnostic Tests
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB We attempted to identify Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3 (pfhrp2/3) deletions among rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-negative but PCR- or microscopy-positive P. falciparum-infected individuals in areas of low transmission (Choma District, 2009-2011) and high transmission (Nchelenge District, 2015-2017) in Zambia. Through community-based surveys, 5,167 participants were screened at 1,147 households by P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based RDTs. Slides were made and dried blood spots were obtained for molecular analysis. Of 28 samples with detectable P. falciparum DNA, none from Nchelenge District were pfhrp2/3 negative. All eight samples from Choma District had detectable pfhrp3 genes, but pfhrp2 was undetectable in three. DNA concentrations of pfhrp2-negative samples were low (< 0.001 ng/mu L). These findings suggest that PfHRP2-based RDTs remain effective tools for malaria diagnosis in Nchelenge District, but further study is warranted to understand the potential for pfhrp2/3 deletions in southern Zambia where malaria transmission declined over the past decade.

TI Prevalence of and Risk Factors Associated with Polymerase Chain
   Reaction-Determined Plasmodium falciparum Positivity on Day 3 after
   Initiation of Artemether-Lumefantrine Treatment for Uncomplicated
   Malaria in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Prevalence of and risk factors associated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-determined Plasmodium falciparum positivity were assessed on day 3 after initiation of treatment, pre-implementation and up to 8 years post-deployment of artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Samples originated from previously reported trials conducted between 2006 and 2014. Cytochrome b-nested PCR was used to detect malaria parasites from blood samples collected on a filter paper on day 3. Chi-square and McNemar chi-squared tests, logistic regression models, and analysis of variance were used as appropriate. Primary outcome was based on the proportion of patients with day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity. Overall, 256/584 (43.8%) of screened patients had day 3 PCR-determined positivity, whereas only 2/584 (0.3%) had microscopy-determined asexual parasitemia. Day 3 PCR-determined positivity increased from 28.0% (14/50) in 2006 to 74.2% (132/178) in 2007-2008 and declined, thereafter, to 36.0% (50/139) in 2012-2013 and 27.6% (60/217) in 2014. When data were pooled, pretreatment microscopy-determined asexual parasitemia >= 100,000/mu L, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, age < 5 years, temperature >= 37.5 degrees C, and year of study 2007-2008 and 2012-2013 were significantly associated with PCR-determined positivity on day 3. Significant increases in P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 N86 and P. falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter K76 across years were not associated with PCR-determined positivity on day 3. No statistically significant association was observed between day 3 PCR-determined positivity and PCR-adjusted recrudescence. Day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity remained common in patients treated before and after implementation of artemether-lumefantrine in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. However, its presence was associated with pretreatment characteristics.

TI Louse-borne relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis infection)
SO EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is an epidemic disease with a fascinating history from Hippocrates' times, through the 6th century ` Yellow Plague', to epidemics in Ireland, Scotland and England in the 19th century and two large Afro-Middle Eastern pandemics in the 20th century. An endemic focus persists in Ethiopia and adjacent territories in the Horn of Africa. Since 2015, awareness of LBRF in Europe, as a re-emerging disease, has been increased dramatically by the discovery of this infection in dozens of refugees arriving from Africa.
   The causative spirochaete, Borrelia recurrentis, has a genome so similar to B. duttonii and B. crocidurae (causes of East and West African tick-borne relapsing fever), that they are now regarded as merely ecotypes of a single genomospecies. Transmission is confined to the human body louse Pediculus humanus corporis, and, perhaps, the head louse P. humanus capitis, although the latter has not been proved. Infection is by inoculation of louse coelomic fluid or faeces by scratching. Nosocomial infections are possible from contamination by infected blood. Between blood meals, body lice live in clothing until the host's body temperature rises or falls, when they seek a new abode.
   The most distinctive feature of LBRF, the relapse phenomenon, is attributable to antigenic variation of borrelial outer-membrane lipoprotein. High fever, rigors, headache, pain and prostration start abruptly, 2-18 days after infection. Petechial rash, epistaxis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and liver dysfunction are common. Severe features include hyperpyrexia, shock, myocarditis causing acute pulmonary oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured spleen, hepatic failure, Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions (J-HR) and opportunistic typhoid or other complicating bacterial infections. Pregnant women are at high risk of aborting and perinatal mortality is high.
   Rapid diagnosis is by microscopy of blood films, but polymerase chain reaction is used increasingly for species diagnosis. Severe falciparum malaria and leptospirosis are urgent differential diagnoses in residents and travellers from appropriate geographical regions.
   High untreated case-fatality, exceeding 40% in some historic epidemics, can be reduced to less than 5% by antibiotic treatment, but elimination of spirochaetaemia is often accompanied by a severe J-HR.
   Epidemics are controlled by sterilising clothing to eliminate lice, using pediculicides and by improving personal hygiene.

TI Beyond Blood Smears: Qualification of Plasmodium 18S rRNA as a Biomarker
   for Controlled Human Malaria Infections
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB 18S rRNA is a biomarker that provides an alternative to thick blood smears in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials. We reviewed data from CHMI trials at non-endemic sites that used blood smears and Plasmodium 18S rRNA/rDNA biomarker nucleic acid tests (NATs) for time to positivity. We validated a multiplex quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for Plasmodium 18S rRNA, prospectively compared blood smears and qRT-PCR for three trials, and modeled treatment effects at different biomarker-defined parasite densities to assess the impact on infection detection, symptom reduction, and measured intervention efficacy. Literature review demonstrated accelerated NAT-based infection detection compared with blood smears (mean acceleration: 3.2-3.6 days). For prospectively tested trials, the validated Plasmodium 18S rRNA qRT-PCR positivity was earlier (7.6 days; 95% CI: 7.1-8.1 days) than blood smears (11.0 days; 95% CI: 10.3-11.8 days) and significantly preceded the onset of grade 2 malaria-related symptoms (12.2 days; 95% CI: 10.6-13.3 days). Discrepant analysis showed that the risk of a blood smear-positive, biomarker-negative result was negligible. Data modeling predicted that treatment triggered by specific biomarker-defined thresholds can differentiate complete, partial, and non-protective outcomes and eliminate many grade 2 and most grade 3 malaria-related symptoms post-CHMI. Plasmodium 18S rRNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker that can justifiably replace blood smears for infection detection in CHMI trials in non-endemic settings. This study led to biomarker qualification through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in CHMI studies at non-endemic sites, which will facilitate biomarker use for the qualified context of use in drug and vaccine trials.

TI Impact of Multiplicity of Plasmodium falciparum Infection on Clinical
   Disease in Malawi
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Multiplicity of infection (MOI), the number of unique Plasmodium falciparum parasite genotypes found in one infected individual, may contribute to the development of clinical malaria disease. However, the independent contribution of MOI and parasite density to clinical disease has not been well characterized. We conducted a two-year longitudinal cohort study of adults and children in a high-transmission setting in Malawi to test the hypothesis that increased MOI was independently associated with clinical disease, after accounting for parasite density. Of 1,062 episodes of infection, 477 (44.9%) were associated with symptoms. After controlling for repeated measures within an individual, key demographic factors, and parasite density, there was no association between MOI and clinical disease (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.70-1.51). Although the limited ability to discern MOI in low-density asymptomatic infections may have impacted our results, we conclude that MOI is not an independent risk factor for clinical disease.

TI Malaria elimination in Bhutan: asymptomatic malaria cases in the
   Bhutanese population living in malaria-risk areas and in migrant workers
   from India
SO REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB In 2018, Bhutan reported 54 cases of malaria, of which six were indigenous, 14 introduced and 34 imported. Considering the continuous reduction in the number of indigenous cases, Bhutan plans to eliminate malaria by 2025 under the Bhutan Malaria Elimination Strategy. The study was conducted to assess the presence of asymptomatic plasmodial infection in both, Bhutanese population living in malaria-risk areas and in migrant workers to guide the elimination strategies. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2016 in 750 Bhutanese people and 473 migrant workers. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections were investigated by using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prevalence of asymptomatic plasmodial infection based on PCR was 0.27% (95% CI: 0.05-1.07%) among Bhutanese people with a mean age of 43 years old. The proportions of males and females were 45% and 55%, respectively. Among migrant workers, the prevalence of asymptomatic plasmodial infection was 0.42% (95% CI: 0.07-1.69%) with a mean age of 30 years old. The majority of migrant workers were from the neighboring Indian State of West Bengal (57.51%), followed by Assam (12.26%). RDT in both study groups did not detect any plasmodial infection. The presence of a low prevalence of asymptomatic plasmodial infection indicates that the current elimination strategies and interventions are effective.

TI Diagnostic Performance of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Microscopy
   Compared with PCR for Detection of Plasmodium falciparum Infections
   among Primary Schoolchildren in Kibiti District, Eastern Tanzania: An
   Area with Moderate Malaria Transmission
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB A substantial decline of malaria transmission intensity has been observed in sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades and may affect the diagnostic performance of malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) and microscopy. Diagnostic performance of histidine-rich protein II (HRP-II)/pan-lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-based mRDT and microscopy was evaluated against polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection among 316 primary schoolchildren in Kibiti district, in 2016. Polymerase chain reaction detected more cases of P. falciparum infection than mRDT or microscopy. Using PCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of mRDT were 75.9% (95% CI = 62.8-86.1) and 96.9% (95% CI = 94.0-98.7), respectively, whereas that of microscopy were 63.8% (95% CI = 50.1-76.0) and 95.7% (95% CI = 92.5-97.9), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction and other molecular methods should be considered for use in schools and other epidemiological surveys as supplement to mRDT or microscopy.

TI Detection of Plasmodium falciparum by Light Microscopy, Loop-Mediated
   Isothermal Amplification, and Polymerase Chain Reaction on Day 3 after
   Initiation of Artemether-Lumefantrine Treatment for Uncomplicated
   Malaria in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania: A Comparative Trial
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Microscopy-determined Plasmodium falciparum positivity rates exceeding 10% on day 3 after initiation of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is an important indicator of artemisinin resistance. However, microscopy does not detect low-density parasitemia, contrary to molecular tools such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We compared microscopy, LAMP, and PCR for detection of P. falciparum on day 3 after ACT in 256 patients with uncomplicated malaria in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania. Day 3 positivity rates were 0%, 84.8%, and 84.4% for each method, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of LAMP against PCR was 100% (95% CI, 96.1-100) and 77.4% (95% CI, 58.9-90.4) when quantitative PCR-determined parasite densities were >= two parasites/mu L. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification had comparable diagnostic accuracy to PCR and could potentially represent a field-friendly tool for determining day 3 positivity rates. However, what day 3 P. falciparum positivity determined using molecular methods represents needs to be further elucidated.

TI Direct Estimation of Sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum Rapid
   Diagnostic Test for Active Case Detection in a High-Transmission
   Community Setting
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Community-based active case detection of malaria parasites with conventional rapid diagnostic tests (cRDTs) is a strategy used most commonly in low-transmission settings. We estimated the sensitivity of this approach in a high-transmission setting in Western Kenya. We tested 3,547 members of 912 households identified in 2013-2014 by index children with (case) and without (control) cRDT-positivemalaria. All were tested for Plasmodium falciparum with both a cRDT targeting histidine-rich protein 2 and with an ultrasensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We computed cRDT sensitivity against PCR as the referent, compared prevalence between participant types, and estimated cRDT detectability as a function of PCR-estimated parasite density. Parasite prevalence was 22.9% by cRDTs and 61.5% by PCR. Compared with children aged < 5 years or adults aged > 15 years, geometric mean parasite densities (95% CI) were highest in school-age children aged 5-15 years (8.4p/uL; 6.6-10.6). The overall sensitivity of cRDT was 36%; among asymptomatic household members, cRDT sensitivity was 25.5% and lowest in adults aged > 15 years (15.8%). When modeled as a function of parasite density, relative to school-age children, the probability of cRDT positivity was reduced in both children aged < 5 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.48; 95% CI: 0.34-0.69) and in adults aged > 15 years (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.27-0.47). An HRP2-detecting cRDT had poor sensitivity for active P. falciparum case detection in asymptomatic community members, and sensitivity was lowest in highly prevalent low-density infections and in adults. Future studies can model the incremental effects of high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic tests and the impacts on transmission.

TI A saliva-based rapid test to quantify the infectious subclinical malaria
   parasite reservoir
SO SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB A large proportion of ongoing malaria parasite transmission is attributed to low-density subclinical infections not readily detected by available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) or microscopy. Plasmodium fakiparum gametocyte carriage is subclinical, but gametocytemic individuals comprise the parasite reservoir that leads to infection of mosquitoes and local transmission. Effective detection and quantification of these carriers can help advance malaria elimination strategies. However, no point-of-need (PON) RDTs for gametocyte detection exist, much less one that can perform noninvasive sampling of saliva outside a clinical setting. Here, we report on the discovery of 35 parasite markers from which we selected a single candidate for use in a PON RDT. We performed a cross-sectional, multi-omics study of saliva from 364 children with subclinical infection in Cameroon and Zambia and produced a prototype saliva-based PON lateral flow immunoassay test for P. fakiparum gametocyte carriers. The test is capable of identifying submicroscopic carriage in both clinical and nonclinical settings and is compatible with archived saliva samples.

TI Is Saglin a mosquito salivary gland receptor for Plasmodium falciparum?
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundSaglin, a 100kDa protein composed of two 50kDa homodimers, is present in the salivary glands of Anopheles gambiae and has been considered an essential receptor for sporozoites (SPZ) of Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), allowing SPZ to recognize, bind to, and infect mosquito salivary glands. Spatial and temporal patterns of Saglin expression reported here, however, suggest that this model does not fully describe the Saglin-SPZ interaction.ResultsSaglin protein was detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy only in the medial and proximal-lateral lobes, but not in the distal-lateral lobes, of the salivary glands of An. gambiae; the pattern of expression was independent of mosquito age or physiological state. These results were confirmed by steady-state Saglin transcript and protein expression using qRT-PCR and Western-blot analysis, respectively. Saglin was localized to the basal surface of the cells of the medial lobes and was undetectable elsewhere (intracellularly, on the lateral or apical membranes, the cells' secretory vacuoles, or in the salivary duct). In the cells of the proximal lateral lobes of the salivary glands, Saglin was distinctly intracellular and was not localized to any of the cell surfaces. Transgenic Anopheles stephensi were produced that expressed An. gambiae Saglin in the distal lateral lobes of the salivary gland. Additional Saglin expression did not enhance infection by PfSPZ compared to non-transgenic siblings fed on the same gametocyte-containing blood meal.ConclusionsThe absence of Saglin in the distal lateral lobes of the salivary glands, a primary destination for SPZ, suggests Saglin is not an essential receptor for Plasmodium SPZ. The lack of any correlation between increased Saglin expression in the distal lateral lobes of the salivary glands of transgenic An. stephensi and PfSPZ infection is also consistent with Saglin not being an essential salivary gland receptor for Plasmodium SPZ.

TI MiRNA-146a polymorphism increases the odds of malaria in pregnancy
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is a major cause of poor maternal health, adverse foetal outcome and infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Genetic disposition is involved in susceptibility to malaria in pregnancy and its manifestation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) influence gene regulation including that of innate immune responses. A miRNA-146a rs2910164 G>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with increased risks of several diseases, but no data as to malaria are available.MethodsThe association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 and P. falciparum infection among 509 Ghanaian women attending antenatal care (ANC) and 296 delivering Ghanaian primiparae was investigated. Malaria parasites were diagnosed by microscopy and PCR. Leukocyte-associated hemozoin in placental samples was recorded as well. Proportions were compared between groups by Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for possible confounders.ResultsBy PCR, P. falciparum infection was detected in 63% and 67% of ANC attendees and delivering primiparae, respectively. In both groups, two in three women were either heterozygous or homozygous for miRNA-146a rs2910164. Among ANC attendees, homozygosity conferred increased odds of infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0), which was pronounced among primigravidae (aOR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.6-26) but only marginal in multigravidae. Likewise, homozygosity for miRNA-146a rs2910164 in primiparae increased the odds of past or present placental P. falciparum infection almost six-fold (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.1-18).ConclusionsThese results indicate that SNP rs2910164 G>C is associated with increased odds for P. falciparum infection in first-time pregnant women who are considered to lack sufficient acquired immune responses against pregnancy-specific strains of P. falciparum. These findings suggest that miRNA-146a is involved in protective malarial immunity, and specifically in the innate component.

TI Molecular monitoring of the diversity of human pathogenic malaria
   species in blood donations on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria can be transmitted by blood transfusion from human to human and it is responsible for the majority of transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, it had been estimated that almost a quarter of blood donations contain malaria parasites. Since rapid diagnostic tests and thick blood smear microscopy lack sensitivity for low density parasitaemia, particularly in asymptomatic adults, the most reliable method to assess the problem of transfusion-transmitted malaria are nucleic acid-based molecular approaches such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of sub-microscopic malaria parasite infection among blood donors in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.MethodsBetween July and August 2017, a total of 200 individual blood samples from blood donors at the Malabo Blood Bank were collected and screened by rapid diagnostic tests and thick blood smear microscopy. Retrospectively, the same samples were analysed for the presence of undetected, low-density malaria parasites using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.ResultsIn comparison to 6.5% (13/200) by rapid diagnostic test and 2.0% (4/200) by microscopy, the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum positive blood donations analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly higher (26%, 52/200). Densities of P. falciparum positive blood donations were ranging from 0.06 to 3707.0 parasites/mu L with 79.6% below 100 parasites/mu L and therefore not detectable by non-molecular malaria diagnostic tests. qPCR based species identification revealed that P. falciparum was the dominating species responsible for 88.1% (52/59) of positive blood donations, followed by Plasmodium malariae (15.3%, 9/59) and Plasmodium ovale (3.4%, 2/59).ConclusionsThis study confirms that in malaria endemic settings, sub-patent malaria infections among blood donors are prevalent. In blood collected from healthy donors living in Malabo, P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale parasites were identified. Currently widely used malaria diagnostic tools have missed more than 75% of P. falciparum containing blood donations, demonstrating the value of quantitative polymerase chain reaction to reliably detect low density P. falciparum infections. Since the availability of molecular diagnostic methods in malaria endemic countries is still limited, the blood recipients living in malaria endemic countries should be treated following WHO recommendations.

TI Genome-wide identification and characterization of transfer RNA-derived
   small RNAs in Plasmodium falciparum
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundTransfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRFs) have been widely identified in nature, functioning in diverse biological and pathological situations. Yet, the presence of these small RNAs in Plasmodium spp. remains unknown. Systematic identification and characterization of tRFs is therefore highly needed to understand further their roles in Plasmodium parasites, particularly in the virulent Plasmodium falciparum parasite.ResultsGenome-wide small RNAs with sizes ranging from 18-30 nucleotides from P. falciparum were deep-sequenced via Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology. In-depth analysis revealed the presence of a vast number of small RNAs originating from tRNA-coding genes, responsible for 22.4% of the total reads as the second predominant group. Three P. falciparum-derived tRF types (ptRFs) were identified as 5'ptRFs, mid-ptRFs and 3'ptRFs. The majority (90%) of ptRFs were derived from tRNAs that coded eight amino acids: Pro, Phe, Asn, Gly, Cys, Gln, His and Ala. Stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction further confirmed the presence of tRFs in the blood stages of P. falciparum. Four new motifs with an enriched G/C feature were determined at cleavage sites that might guide the generation of ptRFs.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide investigation of ptRFs from Plasmodium species. The identification of ptRFs reveals a complex small RNA system manipulated by the malaria parasite, and might promote research on the function of tRFs in the pathogenesis of Plasmodium infections.

TI Susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinins and Plasmodium
   vivax to chloroquine in Phuoc Chien Commune, Ninh Thuan Province,
   south-central Vietnam
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundReduced artemisinin susceptibility and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)-resistance against Plasmodium falciparum and chloroquine(CQ)-resistant P. vivax malaria has been reported in Vietnam. Two therapeutic efficacy studies were conducted in Thuan Bac District (Ninh Thuan Province, Vietnam) in 2015 and 2016 to determine the extent of reduced artemisinin susceptibility and ACT resistant falciparum malaria, and CQ-resistant vivax malaria were present.MethodsTwenty-seven patients with falciparum malaria were randomized to receive artesunate alone (AS4mg/kg/day) for 4days followed by dihydroartemisinin (DHA) (2.2mg/kg)-piperaquine (PPQ) (18mg/kg) daily for 3days or artemether (AM) (1.7mg/kg)-lumefantrine (LUM) (12mg/kg) twice daily for 3days. Sixteen subjects with vivax malaria received CQ (total 25mg/kg over 3days). The therapeutic efficacy study for treating falciparum malaria was complemented with molecular analysis for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance, and in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Patient's drug exposure following both falciparum and vivax treatment studies was determined.ResultsTwenty-five of 27 patients treated with the artemisinin regimens completed the 42-day follow-up period. None had parasites present on day 3 after commencing treatment with no incidence of recrudescence (100% curative rate). One patient on AS+DHA-PPQ was lost to follow-up and one patient had Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection on day 0 by PCR. Of the vivax patients, 15 of 16 completed CQ treatment and two had a recurrence of vivax malaria on day 28, a failure rate of 13.3% (2/15). No mutations in the Pfkelch-13 gene for artemisinin resistance or exo-E415G gene polymorphism and amplification in plasmepsins 2 and 3 for piperaquine resistance were observed. In vitro testing of patient's falciparum parasites indicated susceptibility (low IC50 nM values) to dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, piperaquine and pyronaridine. Patient's drug exposure to artesunate and lumefantrine was comparable to published data, however, blood CQ concentrations were lower.ConclusionsClinical findings, molecular analysis and in vitro testing revealed that the falciparum parasites at Phuoc Chien Commune were artemisinin susceptible. The clinical failure rate of the 15 vivax patients who completed CQ treatment was 13%. Further studies are required to determine whether CQ-resistant vivax malaria is present at the commune.

TI Mixed Infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium ovale in a
   Returned Traveller: the First Case in Korea
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Mixed-species malaria infections are often unrecognized or underestimated. We hereby report the first described case of mixed infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium ovale malaria in a returned traveller in Korea. In August 2016, a 25-year-old returned traveller from Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo presented with fever. He was diagnosed as P. flaciparum malaria and successfully treated with artesunate. And 5 weeks after the completion of treatment, he presented with fever and diagnosed as P. ovale infection. P ovale infection is a rare cause of malaria and often shows delayed presentation due to its dormant liver stage as hypnozoites. At re-presentation, the immunochromatographic test and microscopic examinations of our patient did not reveal P. ovale, which was only detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. This case highlights the importance of considering malaria infection even in persons who have previously received malaria treatment. It also shows the usefulness of PCR testing for diagnosing P. ovale infections, which often present with a low level of parasitaemia.

TI Bead-based assays to simultaneously detect multiple human inherited
   blood disorders associated with malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd), haemoglobin C (HbC) and S (HbS) are inherited blood disorders (IBD) common in populations in malaria endemic areas. All are associated to some degree with protection against clinical malaria whilst additionally G6PDd is associated with haemolysis following treatment with 8-aminoquinolines. Measuring the prevalence of these inherited blood disorders in affected populations can improve understanding of disease epidemiology. Current methodologies in epidemiological studies commonly rely on individual target amplification and visualization; here a method is presented to simultaneously detect the polymorphisms and that can be expanded to include other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interest.
   Methods: Human DNA from whole blood samples was amplified in a novel, multiplex PCR reaction and extended with SNP-specific probes in an allele specific primer extension (ASPE) to simultaneously detect four epidemiologically important human markers including G6PD SNPs (G202A and A376G) and common haemoglobin mutations (HbS and HbC). The products were hybridized to magnetic beads and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was read on MAGPIX (R) (Luminex corp.). Genotyping data was compared to phenotypical data generated by flow cytometry and to established genotyping methods.
   Results: Seventy-five samples from Burkina Faso (n = 75/78, 96.2%) and 58 samples from The Gambia (n = 58/61, 95.1%) had a G6PD and a HBB genotype successfully assigned by the bead-based assay. Flow cytometry data available for n = 61 samples further supported the concordance between % G6PD normal/deficient cells and genotype.
   Conclusions: The bead based assay compares well to alternative measures of genotyping and phenotyping for G6PD. The screening is high throughput, adaptable to inclusion of multiple targets of interest and easily standardized.

TI Interaction between maternally derived antibodies and heterogeneity in
   exposure combined to determine time-to-first Plasmodium falciparum
   infection in Kenyan infants
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundStudies of the association between the level of anti-malarial antibody and protection from malaria infection can yield conflicting results if they fail to take into account differences in the malaria transmission rate. This can occur because high malaria exposure may drive high antibody responses, leading to an apparent positive association between immune response and infection rate. The neonatal period provides a unique window to study the protective effects of antibodies, because waning maternally-derived antibodies lead to different levels of protection with time.MethodsThis study uses data from two well-defined infant cohorts in Western Kenya with different burdens of malaria transmission. Survival models were used to assess how the magnitude of maternally derived malaria-specific IgG antibody (to 24 malaria antigens measured using Luminex beads) affected the time-to-first Plasmodium falciparum infection (detected by PCR). In addition, mathematical models were used to assess how the frequency of malaria infection varied between the cohorts with different exposure levels.ResultsDespite differences in underlying malaria incidence in the two regions, there was no difference in time-to-first malaria infection between the cohorts. However, there was a significant period of protection observed in children with high initial MSP1 (42kDa fragment)-specific antibody levels, but this protection was not observed in children with low antibody levels. Children from the high transmission cohort had both longer initial periods of protection from malaria (attributable to higher initial antibody levels), but more rapid time-to-first-infection once malaria specific maternal antibodies declined below protective levels (attributable to higher exposure rates).ConclusionThis study demonstrates the complex interaction between passive (maternally-derived) immunity and the degree of malaria exposure in infants. Children from regions of high malaria transmission had higher levels of maternally-derived antibodies in early life, which led to a significant protection for several months. However, once this immunity waned, the underlying higher frequency of infection was revealed. A better understanding of the interaction between malaria exposure, immunity, and transmission risk will assist in identifying protective immune responses in P. falciparum infection.

TI From high to low malaria transmission in Zanzibar-challenges and
   opportunities to achieve elimination
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Substantial global progress in the control of malaria in recent years has led to increased commitment to its potential elimination. Whether this is possible in high transmission areas of sub-Saharan Africa remains unclear. Zanzibar represents a unique case study of such attempt, where modern tools and strategies for malaria treatment and vector control have been deployed since 2003.
   We have studied temporal trends of comprehensive malariometric indices in two districts with over 100,000 inhabitants each. The analyses included triangulation of data from annual community-based cross-sectional surveys, health management information systems, vital registry and entomological sentinel surveys.
   The interventions, with sustained high-community uptake, were temporally associated with a major malaria decline, most pronounced between 2004 and 2007 and followed by a sustained state of low transmission. In 2015, the Plasmodium falciparum community prevalence of 0.43% (95% CI 0.23-0.73) by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test represented 96% reduction compared with that in 2003. The P. falciparum and P. malariae prevalence by PCR was 1.8% (95% CI 1.3-2.3), and the annual P. falciparum incidence was estimated to 8 infections including 2.8 clinical episodes per 1000 inhabitants. The total parasite load decreased over 1000-fold (99.9%) between 2003 and 2015. The incidence of symptomatic malaria at health facilities decreased by 94% with a trend towards relatively higher incidence in age groups > 5 years, a more pronounced seasonality and with reported travel history to/from Tanzania mainland as a higher risk factor. All-cause mortality among children < 5 years decreased by 72% between 2002 and 2007 mainly following the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies whereas the main reduction in malaria incidence followed upon the vector control interventions from 2006. Human biting rates decreased by 98% with a major shift towards outdoor biting by Anopheles arabiensis.
   Zanzibar provides new evidence of the feasibility of reaching uniquely significant and sustainable malaria reduction (pre-elimination) in a previously high endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa. The data highlight constraints of optimistic prognostic modelling studies. New challenges, mainly with outdoor transmission, a large asymptomatic parasite reservoir and imported infections, require novel tools and reoriented strategies to prevent a rebound effect and achieve elimination.

TI Prevalence of human and non-human primate Plasmodium parasites in
   anopheline mosquitoes: a cross-sectional epidemiological study in
   Southern Vietnam
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background: Human malaria is a major threat in rural communities of central Vietnam. Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus species are critical malaria vectors in Vietnam, which transmit Plasmodium parasites. However, the entomological aspects of malaria transmission in some of the central provinces of Vietnam remain unexplored. Hence, a cross-sectional entomological survey was carried out to identify the malaria vector species and the transmission of Plasmodium parasites in seven endemic provinces of Vietnam.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected from seven provinces, Gia Lai, Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan, Dong Nai, and Binh Phuoc. The collection was conducted for four to eight consecutive nights using three established methods, indoor and outdoor human landing catches and light trap method. Nested-PCR analysis was performed to detect the Plasmodium species in the separated thorax and the abdomen of the individual mosquitoes.
   Results: A total of 2278 mosquitoes belonging to one of the four species of anopheline mosquitoes, An. dirus, An. maculatus, An. aconitus, and An. minimus were collected. Among the collected mosquitoes, 1398 were analysed using nested-PCR, of which, 40 mosquitoes were positive for Plasmodium parasites. Most of these parasites were detected in the samples from the thorax region, followed by the abdominal portion. The parasites were detected in both the thorax and abdomen of An. dirus. Seven species of Plasmodium parasites were detected during the analysis, of which, Plasmodium inui was the most common species, followed by Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium coatneyi, Plasmodium knowlesi, and Plasmodium fieldi. Out of the 49 positive samples, 12 showed mixed infections. Co-infection of P. inui with human and other non-human primate Plasmodium species was common.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the presence of human and non-human primate Plasmodium infection in An. dirus, a predominant malarial vector. Further, we showed that An. maculatus and An. minimus species also take part in malarial transmission. This might potentially lead to an alarming situation conducive for the emergence of novel zoonotic malaria.

TI Malaria prevalence, knowledge, perception, preventive and treatment
   behavior among military in Champasak and Attapeu provinces, Lao PDR: a
   mixed methods study
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background: Malaria is a major health problem in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) with high transmission in remote and forest areas, particularly in the South. The military is at risk of malaria infection especially those deployed in forest areas. This study determined the prevalence of malaria infection and assessed knowledge, perception, and preventive and treatment behavior regarding malaria among military personnel in two southern provinces in Lao PDR.
   Methods: Quantitative and qualitative approaches were undertaken in Champasak and Attapeu provinces in 2017. From 313 military personnel, quantitative data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews and blood samples used for parasite detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Qualitative data were collected through 7 focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews among 49 military personnel. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess the association between malaria infection and participant characteristics. Content analysis for qualitative data was performed to explore perception and treatment behaviors regarding malaria.
   Results: The prevalence of malaria infection was 11.2% (Plasmodium falciparum: 1.3%, Plasmodium vivax: 9.3% and mixed infections: 0.6%). Many participants understood that malaria is transmitted through mosquito bites, although they did not necessarily know the name of vector mosquitoes (Anopheles). Surprisingly, more than a half also believed that malaria is transmitted through drinking stream water. One-third of the participants used long-lasting insecticidal nets. Due to limited supply, participants were often unable to use mosquito repellent and coils when necessary. Because participants were unable to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment for malaria in their camps, they commonly practiced self-treatment using antibiotics, painkillers, and/or traditional medicines. They only go to a healthcare facility through their supervisor if their conditions worsen.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria was conspicuous among military in forest areas. Many participants believed that malaria is transmitted not only by mosquito bites but also from drinking stream water. Preventive equipment was often insufficient. Self-treatment was practiced before referring to healthcare facility. To further prevent military from contracting malaria, the National Malaria Control Program and military body should provide adequate and suitable health education, protective equipment, and on-site malaria case management.

TI Oasis Malaria, Northern Mauritania
SO EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB A malaria survey was conducted in Atar, the northernmost oasis city in Mauritania, during 2015-2016. All febrile patients in whom malaria was suspected were screened for malaria by using rapid diagnostic testing and microscopic examination of blood smears and later confirmed by PCR. Of 453 suspected malaria cases, 108 (23.8%) were positive by rapid diagnostic testing, 154 (34.0%) by microscopic examination, and 162 (35.7%) by PCR. Malaria cases were observed throughout the year and among all age groups. Plasmodium vivax was present in 120/162 (74.1%) cases, P. falciparum in 4/162 (2.4%), and mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax in 38/162 (23.4%). Malaria is endemic in northern Mauritania and could be spreading farther north in the Sahara, possibly because of human-driven environmental changes. Further entomologic and parasitologic studies and monitoring are needed to relate these findings to major Anopheles mosquito vectors and to design and implement strategies for malaria prevention and control.

TI Diversity and biting patterns of Anopheles species in a malaria endemic
   area, Umphang Valley, Tak Province, western Thailand
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Malaria is highly endemic in Umphang Valley, a district in the western edge of Tak Province, along the boundary with Kayin State of Myanmar. Although there are high indigenous malaria cases in this area every year, nothing about malaria vectors and their transmission role have been investigated before this study. The objective of this work is to characterize the Anopheles species diversity and trophic behavior of malaria vectors in the transmission area of Umphang Valley. Females of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected every two months during a two-year period. Mosquito collections were using standard collection technique, indoor and outdoor human landing collections and outdoor cattle bait collection. Anopheles mosquitoes were identified using morphological characters and multiplex AS-PCR assay for the identification of sibling species within groups and complexes present. From a total of 16,468 Anopheles females, 2723 specimens (16.54%) were collected from humans and 13,745 specimens (83.46%) were captured from cattle. From human landing collections, 2447 specimens (89.86%) of Anopheles minimus were obtained, followed by 119 Anopheles peditaeniatus (4.37%), 62 Anopheles maculatus (2.28%), 17 Anopheles dirus (0.6%), 15 Anopheles aconites (0.5%) and 6 Anopheles sawadwongporni (0.2%) respectively. Seven putative malaria vectors, including An. minimus, An. dirus, An. hobnail, An. sawadwongporni, An. maculatus, An. pseudowillmori and An. aconites were documented from this study and trophic behavior of each respective species were observed. Such information is definitely crucial for defining the vector capacity of each single species and for designing appropriate vector prevention and control strategies against target vector species.

TI The impact of targeted malaria elimination with mass drug
   administrations on falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia: A cluster
   randomised trial
SO PLOS MEDICINE
AB Background
   The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) threatens global malaria elimination efforts. Mass drug administration (MDA), the presumptive antimalarial treatment of an entire population to clear the subclinical parasite reservoir, is a strategy to accelerate malaria elimination. We report a cluster randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) MDA in reducing falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence in 16 remote village populations in Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, where artemisinin resistance is prevalent.
   Methods and findings
   After establishing vector control and community-based case management and following intensive community engagement, we used restricted randomisation within village pairs to select 8 villages to receive early DP MDA and 8 villages as controls for 12 months, after which the control villages received deferred DP MDA. The MDA comprised 3 monthly rounds of 3 daily doses of DP and, except in Cambodia, a single low dose of primaquine. We conducted exhaustive cross-sectional surveys of the entire population of each village at quarterly intervals using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR to detect Plasmodium infections. The study was conducted between May 2013 and July 2017. The investigators randomised 16 villages that had a total of 8,445 residents at the start of the study. Of these 8,445 residents, 4,135 (49%) residents living in 8 villages, plus an additional 288 newcomers to the villages, were randomised to receive early MDA; 3,790 out of the 4,423 (86%) participated in at least 1 MDA round, and 2,520 out of the 4,423 (57%) participated in all 3 rounds. The primary outcome, P. falciparum prevalence by month 3 (M3), fell by 92% (from 5.1% [171/3,340] to 0.4% [12/2,828]) in early MDA villages and by 29% (from 7.2% [246/3,405] to 5.1% [155/3,057]) in control villages. Over the following 9 months, the P. falciparum prevalence increased to 3.3% (96/2,881) in early MDA villages and to 6.1% (128/2,101) in control villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.84]; p = 0.015). Individual protection was proportional to the number of completed MDA rounds. Of 221 participants with subclinical P. falciparum infections who participated in MDA and could be followed up, 207 (94%) cleared their infections, including 9 of 10 with artemisinin-and piperaquine- resistant infections. The DP MDAs were well tolerated; 6 severe adverse events were detected during the follow-up period, but none was attributable to the intervention.
   Conclusions
   Added to community-based basic malaria control measures, 3 monthly rounds of DP MDA reduced the incidence and prevalence of falciparum malaria over a 1-year period in areas affected by artemisinin resistance. P. falciparum infections returned during the follow-up period as the remaining infections spread and malaria was reintroduced from surrounding areas. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample of villages, heterogeneity between villages, and mobility of villagers that may have limited the impact of the intervention. These results suggest that, if used as part of a comprehensive, well-organised, and well-resourced elimination programme, DP MDA can be a useful additional tool to accelerate malaria elimination.

TI The blood transcriptome of childhood malaria
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Transcriptomic research of blood cell lineages supports the understanding of distinct features of the immunopathology in human malaria.
   Methods: We used microarray hybridization, validated by real-time RT-PCR to analyze whole blood gene expression in healthy Gabonese children and children with various conditions of Plasmodium falciparum infection, including i) asymptomatic infection, ii) uncomplicated malaria, iii) malaria associated with severe anemia and iv) cerebral malaria.
   Findings: Our data indicate that the expression profile of 22 genes significantly differed among the investigated groups. Immunoglobulin production, complement regulation and IFN beta signaling, in particular IRF7 and ISRE binding signatures in the corresponding genes, were most conspicuous. Down-regulation in cerebral malaria seems to rely on AhRF, GABP and HIF1 hypoxia transcription factors. ARG1, BPI, CD163, IFI27, HP and TNFAIP6 transcript levels correlated positively with lactatemia, and negatively with hemoglobin concentrations.
   Interpretation: Differences in gene expression profile reflect distinct immunopathological mechanisms of P. falciparum infection. They emerge as potential prognostic markers for early therapeutic measures and need to be validated further. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Comparative analysis of three methods from dried blood spots for
   expeditious DNA extraction from mosquitoes; suitable for PCR based
   techniques
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB The objective of this work was to compare the quality, purity and quantity of DNA isolated from dried blood spots (DBS) by three methods (Chelex-100, QIAamp DNA mini kit, and TE (Tris EDTA)-Buffer). Sample collection was performed in six districts in Odisha, India and screened for cases of clinical malaria and dengue and vector density. Mosquito abdomens were spotted on Whatman 3MM (MERCK) Filter paper and dried for 10min at room temperature. DNA was isolated from DBS using three methods (Chelex-100, QIAamp DNA mini kit, and TE-Buffer), and PCR was used to determine the feeding behaviours of vector mosquitoes. DNA was quantified using a UV-spectrophotometer, and q-PCR was used to determine the target gene copy number to compare the methods. The QIAamp DNA mini kit method was used as the reference method. The yield and purity of DNA extracted with Chelex-100 and TE were 14-72ng/mu l and 1.51-1.85 and 9-50ng/mu l and 1.68-2.1, respectively. DNA extracted using the Chelex-100 method was stored for over 1 month at -20 degrees C and was suitable for later use. The Chelex-100 method had a sensitivity of 99.5% and specificity of 78%. A Bland-Altman plot suggested that the Chelex-100 method was similar to the QIAamp DNA mini kit method for determining the feeding behaviours of vector mosquitoes. The Chelex-100 method is simple, cost-effective, and safe and requires minimal time for DNA extraction from dried blood spots. In malaria and dengue research, detecting the feeding behaviours from mosquito DNA from dried blood spots on filter paper by PCR is an easy, minimally invasive and inexpensive molecular technique that can be performed in remote areas.

TI Screening for Pfhrp2/3-Deleted Plasmodium falciparum, Non-falciparum,
   and Low-Density Malaria Infections by a Multiplex Antigen Assay
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Detection of Plasmodium antigens provides evidence of malaria infection status and is the basis for most malaria diagnosis.
   We developed a sensitive bead-based multiplex assay for laboratory use, which simultaneously detects pan-Plasmodium aldolase (pAldo), pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) antigens. The assay was validated against purified recombinant antigens, monospecies malaria infections, and noninfected blood samples. To test against samples collected in an endemic setting, Angolan outpatient samples (n = 1267) were assayed.
   Of 466 Angolan samples positive for at least 1 antigen, the most common antigen profiles were PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH+ (167, 36%), PfHRP2+/pAldo/pLDH (163, 35%), and PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH (129, 28%). Antigen profile was predictive of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and parasite density. Eight Angolan samples (1.7%) had no or very low PfHRP2 but were positive for 1 or both of the other antigens. PCR analysis confirmed 3 (0.6%) were P. ovale infections and 2 (0.4%) represented P. falciparum parasites lacking Pfhrp2 and/or Pfhrp3.
   These are the first reports of Pfhrp2/3 deletion mutants in Angola. High-throughput multiplex antigen detection can inexpensively screen for low-density P. falciparum, non-falciparum, and Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites to provide population-level antigen estimates and identify specimens requiring further molecular characterization.A multiplex malaria antigen detection assay was developed to measure pan-Plasmodium antigens aldolase and LDH, and P. falciparum HRP2. Multiplex antigen detection allowed for prediction of malaria infection status, species of infection, and detection of Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites.

TI Prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B among pregnant women in Northern
   Ghana: Comparing RDTs with PCR
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   High prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B has been reported among pregnant women in Ghana. In endemic areas, the diagnoses of malaria and hepatitis B among pregnant women on antenatal visits are done using histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), respectively, which are, however, reported to give some false positive results. Also, socio-economic determinants have been drawn from these RDTs results which may have questionable implications. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B by comparing RDTs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) outcomes, and relating the PCR prevalence with socio-economic status among pregnant women in Northern Ghana.
   Methods
   We screened 2071 pregnant women on their first antenatal visit for Plasmodium falciparum and hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HRP2 and HBsAg RDTs, and confirming the infections with PCR. Socio-economic and obstetric information were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire, and associations with the infections were determined using Pearson's chisquare and multinomial logistic regression analyses at a significance level of p<0.05.
   Results
   The prevalence of the infections by RDTs/PCR was: 14.1%/13.4% for P. falciparum mono-infection, 7.9%/7.5% for HBV mono-infection, and 1.9%/1.7% for P. falciparum/HBV co-infection. No statistical difference in prevalence rates were observed between the RDTs and PCRs (chi(2) = 0.119, p = 0.73 for malaria and chi(2) = 0.139, p = 0.709 for hepatitis B). Compared with PCRs, the sensitivity/specificity of the RDTs was 97.5%/99.1% and 97.9%/99.4% for HRP2 and HBsAg respectively. Socio-economic status was observed not to influence HBV mono-infection among the pregnant women (educational status: AOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.52-1.16, p = 0.222; economic status: AOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.72-1.56, p = 0.739; financial status: AOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-1.00, p = 0.052). However, pregnant women with formal education were at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32-0.71, p<0.001) and P. falciparum/HBV co-infection (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.11-0.67, p = 0.005). Also those with good financial status were also at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74, p<0.001).
   Conclusion
   Our data has shown that, the RDTs are comparable to PCR and can give a representative picture of the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B in endemic countries. Also, our results support the facts that improving socio-economic status is paramount in eliminating malaria in endemic settings. However, socio-economic status did not influence the prevalence of HBV mono-infection among pregnant women in Northern Ghana.

TI A new high-resolution melting analysis for the detection and
   identification of Plasmodium in human and Anopheles vectors of malaria
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Among vector-borne diseases malaria is the leading cause of morbidity in the world, with more than 200 million cases per year and a large number of deaths. The techniques traditionally used for the detection of Plasmodium in humans and Anopheles mosquitoes include microscopy, IRMA, ELISA, antibody or molecular assays, and anopheline dissection. However, these techniques are limited by their requirement of skilled personnel, low sensitivity or long processing times. A PCR-based high-resolution melting (PCR-HRM) analysis was developed for the detection and identification of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae that infect humans and Anopheles. In 41 human samples PCR-HRM detected 14 samples positive for P. vivax, 17 for P. falciparum, three for P. malariae, three mixed infections for P. vivax/P. malariae and four negative samples. Whereas benchmarking assays of microscopy and nested PCR had false positive detections. Additionally, PCR-HRM was able to detect natural infection with Plasmodium spp. in An. darlingi and An. mattogrossensis. The PCR-HRM presented is the first single assay developed for the detection and identification of P. vivax, P. falciparum and/or P. malariae in human and Anopheles. This method improves on currently available assays as it is easy-to-use, rapid, sensitive and specific with a low risk of contamination.

TI A previously unreported potential malaria vector in a dry ecology of
   Kenya
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundIn Kenya, malaria remains a major public health menace equally affecting the semi-arid to arid ecologies. However, entomologic knowledge of malaria vectors in such areas remains poor.MethodsMorphologically-identified wild-caught Anopheles funestus (s.l.) specimens trapped outdoors from the semi-arid to arid area of Kacheliba, West Pokot County, Kenya, were analysed by PCR and sequencing for species identification, malaria parasite infection and hostblood-meal sources.ResultsThree hundred and thirty specimens were analysed to identify sibling species of the An. funestus group, none of which amplified using the available primers; two were infected with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium ovale, separately, while 84% (n = 25) of the blood-fed specimens had fed on humans. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences of 55 specimens (Plasmodium-positive, blood-fed and Plasmodium-negative) did not match reference sequences, possibly suggesting a previously unreported species, resolving as two clades.ConclusionsOur findings indicate the existence of yet-to-be identified and described anopheline species with a potential as malaria vectors in Kenya.

TI Geographical heterogeneity in prevalence of subclinical malaria
   infections at sentinel endemic sites of Myanmar
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The malaria burden of Myanmar still remains high within the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia. An important indicator of progress towards malaria elimination is the prevalence of parasite infections in endemic populations. Information about malaria epidemiology is mostly derived from reports of confirmed acute malaria cases through passive case detection, whereas the prevalence of baseline subclinical malaria infections is much less known.
   Methods: In this study, cross-sectional surveys were conducted during the rainy season of 2017 in four townships (Bilin, Thabeikkyin, Banmauk and Paletwa) of Myanmar with divergent annual malaria incidences. A total of 1991 volunteers were recruited from local villages and Plasmodium subclinical infections were estimated by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and nested PCR. The nested PCR analysis was performed with a modified pooling strategy that was optimized based on an initial estimate the infection prevalence.
   Results: The overall malaria infection prevalence based on all methods was 13.9% (277/1991) and it differed drastically among the townships, with Paletwa in the western border having the highest infection rate (22.9%) and Thabeikkyin in central Myanmar having the lowest (3.9%). As expected, nested PCR was the most sensitive and identified 226 (11.4%) individuals with parasite infections. Among the parasite species, Plasmodium vivax was the most prevalent in all locations, while Plasmodium falciparum also accounted for 32% of infections in the western township Paletwa. Two RDTs based on the detection of the hrp2 antigen detected a total of 103 P. falciparum infections, and the ultrasensitive RDT detected 20% more P. falciparum infections than the conventional RDT. In contrast, LM missed the majority of the subclinical infections and only identified 14 Plasmodium infections.
   Conclusions: Cross-sectional surveys identified considerable levels of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in endemic populations of Myanmar with P. vivax becoming the predominant parasite species. Geographical heterogeneity of subclinical infections calls for active surveillance of parasite infections in endemic areas. The pooling scheme designed for nested PCR analysis offers a more practical strategy for large-scale epidemiological studies of parasite prevalence. Such information is important for decision-makers to put forward a more realistic action plan for malaria elimination.

TI Relationship between weight status and anti-malarial drug efficacy and
   safety in children in Mali
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Anti-malarial treatments effectiveness remains a critical challenge for control programmes. However, when drug efficacy is established, the dose is calculated based on a predefined weight according to the patient age. Based on the hypothesis that the standard assumption of weight according to the age when administering the drug could lead to a therapeutic failure potentially due to under-dosing (in the case of overweight) or over-dosing (in case of underweight). In this study, the relationship between weight status and malaria drug efficacy in clearing current Plasmodium falciparum infection and preventing reinfection after treatment was investigated.
   Methods: Data were drown from a clinical trial conducted previously to investigate malaria drug efficacy in 749 children from Mali (2002-2004). Participants were treated either with artesunate + amodiaquine (AS + AQ, n1 = 250), artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP, n2 = 248) or artesunate (AS, n3 = 251) and followed for 28days after treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) z-score was used to define weight status. A Chi square test was used to compare outcomes according to drugs, weight status and the dynamic of ALAT, ASAT, creatinine and haemoglobin level. Logistic regression models were developed to determine the effect of baseline parameters (weight status, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and haemoglobin level) on drug efficacy as per WHO criteria.
   Results: Without molecular correction, in AS + AQ arm, the rate of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) was higher in the group of underweight children 94.74% compared to children with normal and overweight (91.24% and 80.43% respectively, p=0.03). After PCR correction, treatment efficacy was similar in the three groups of patients and was above 98% (p = 0.4). Overweight was observed to have no impact on recrudescence. However, it was associated with an increased risk of new infections in the (AS + AQ) arm (OR = 0.21, 95% CI [0.06; 0.86], p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that weight deficiency has no deleterious effect on anti-malarial drug efficacy. An increase in the rate of reinfection in overweight children treated by AS + AQ should be further explored in larger studies.

TI Association of high Plasmodium falciparum parasite densities with
   polyclonal microscopic infections in asymptomatic children from
   Toubacouta, Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in tropical countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In Senegal, a control plan implemented in the beginning of the 2000s has enabled a substantial reduction of mortality and morbidity due to malaria. However, eradication of malaria requires a vaccine that protects against Plasmodium falciparum the deadliest species of the parasite that causes this disease. Plasmodium falciparum is characterized by an extensive genetic diversity that makes vaccine development challenging. In this study, the diversity of P. falciparum isolates was analysed from asymptomatic children residing in the district of Toubacouta, Senegal.MethodsA nested PCR approach was used to perform genotyping of the msp-1 and msp-2 loci in samples from 87 asymptomatic children infected with P. falciparum, collected during a cross sectional survey in November and December 2010. Parasite densities in blood samples were determined by microscopic examination and statistical analyses were used to identify association of parasite genotype and parasitaemia.ResultsGenotyping was successful in 84/87 and 82/87 samples for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. A strong genetic diversity was found with a total of 15 and 21 different alleles identified for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. RO33 was the most frequent allelic family of msp-1 followed by MAD20, then by K1. Regarding msp-2 allelic families, 3D7 was more common than FC27. Multiple infections were predominant, since 69% and 89% of the samples genotyped for msp-1 and msp-2 showed more than one clone of P. falciparum with complexity of infection (COI) of 2.5 and 4.7, respectively. Expected heterozygosity (H-E) was 0.57 and 0.55 for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. Interestingly, polyclonal infections were significantly associated with higher parasitaemia.ConclusionsThe strong genetic diversity of P. falciparum clones and the association of polyclonal infection with high parasitaemia call for a multi-allelic approach in the design of vaccine candidates for efficient malaria eradication.

TI Detection of sub-microscopic blood levels of Plasmodium falciparum using
   Tandem Oligonucleotide Repeat Cascade Amplification (TORCA) assay with
   an attomolar detection limit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Tandem Oligonucleotide Repeat Cascade Amplification (TORCA) based on signal rather than target amplification under isothermal conditions was developed for nucleic acid assays. The initial signal was generated by hybridization of single stranded DNA targets to immobilized recognition probes followed by hybrid cleavage with specific restriction endonuclease (REase), and release of trigger oligonucleotides (Tr1). The signal amplification chamber contained two bead types carrying single-stranded amplification probes and two amplification REases. The probes consisted of multiple tandem repeats of either Tr1 or another trigger Tr2, with the tandem-Tr1 anchored to the beads through the antisense Tr2 linker and vice versa. Addition of the recognition reaction solution and Tr1 hybridization to the anti-Tr1 linkers started cleavage and release of additional Tr1 and Tr2, resulting in exponential signal amplification. The cleavage cascade also released horseradish peroxidase (HRP) pre-attached to the amplification probes, and the resultant signal was measured colorimetrically. A TORCA assay was developed for detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in blood. It had the detection limit in the attomolar concentration range, successfully detecting sub-microscopic P. falciparum infections at less than 0.75 infected erythrocytes per microliter. Further TORCA optimization will likely produce the quantitative isothermal alternative to PCR at a fraction of its cost.

TI An update on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in children
   from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria transmission-blocking anti-malarial drugs, such as primaquine, offers an effective strategy for reducing the incidence of falciparum malaria. However, this drug induces haemolytic anaemia among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. The distribution of G6PD deficiency in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo and the association of G6PD deficiency with haemoglobin levels and blood cell counts were investigated.MethodsA total of 212 febrile children were recruited for this study. Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis was conducted by microscopy and nested PCR. Sanger sequencing was used to assess G6PD deficiency by detecting 202G>A (rs1050828) and 376A>G (rs1050829) single nucleotide polymorphisms.ResultsTwo hundred and twelve children were successfully genotyped for G6PD variants. Overall, 13% (27/212) of the children were G6PD deficient and 25% (25/100) females were heterozygous (11 BA- and 14 A+A-). The remaining 160 children had a normal G6PD genotype. The mean red blood and mean platelet counts were significantly lower in hemizygous male (G6PD A-) participants than in normal male (G6PD A+ or B) participants (p<0.05).ConclusionThis study gives an update on G6PD deficiency among Congolese children. Understanding the distribution of G6PD deficiency in other geographical regions is recommended before primaquine is adopted in the malaria control programme.

TI Efficacy and Safety of Pyronaridine-Artesunate plus Single-Dose
   Primaquine for Treatment of Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
   in Eastern Cambodia
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB In Cambodia, multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum undermines the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, and new therapeutic options are needed. Pyronaridine-artesunate has not previously been evaluated in eastern Cambodia. We conducted a single-arm, open-label, prospective study between July and December 2017 at the Koh Gnek (Mondulkiri) and Veun Sai (Rattanakiri) health centers in eastern Cambodia. Eligible patients were aged >= 7 years (females, ages 12 to 18 years, were excluded), weighing >= 20 kg, with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum monoinfection and fever. Oral pyronaridine-artesunate was administered once daily for 3 days, dosed according to body weight, plus a single dose of primaquine on day 0. Sixty patients were recruited to Koh Gnek, and 61 patients were recruited to Veun Sai. The primary outcomes, i.e., the day 42 PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPRs), were 98.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.4 to 99.8) in Koh Gnek and 96.7% (95% CI, 87.3 to 99.2) in Veun Sai (Kaplan-Meier). In a per-protocol analysis, the proportions of patients with day 42 PCR-adjusted ACPRs were 98.3% (57/58; 95% CI, 90.8 to 100.0) at Koh Gnek and 96.7% (58/60; 95% CI, 88.5 to 99.6) at Veun Sai. The Kelch13 (C580Y) mutation was present in 70.0% (77/110) of isolates. The copy numbers were increased in 61.3% (73/119) of isolates for Pfpm2 and in 1.7% (2/119) for Pfmdr1. There was no relationship between outcome and the 50% inhibitory concentration of pyronaridine. Adverse events were consistent with malaria, and there were no serious adverse events. Pyronaridine-artesunate has high efficacy in eastern Cambodia and could be used to increase the diversity of antimalarial therapy in the region.

TI Monitoring the Efficacy and Safety of Artemisinin-Based Combination
   Therapies: A Review and Network Meta-analysis of Antimalarial
   Therapeutic Efficacy Trials in Cameroon
SO DRUGS IN R&D
AB IntroductionArtemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line antimalarial drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum alaria in many endemic countries worldwide. The present work reviewed the therapeutic efficacy of ACT in Cameroon more than 10 years after the initial change in national drug policy in 2004.MethodsA PubMed literature search was performed to analyse clinical trials conducted in Cameroon from 2001 to May 2017. Clinical studies that evaluated ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children or adults, and reported efficacy and/or safety, were included. In addition, a small network meta-analysis (NMA) with a frequentist approach was performed.ResultsSix papers were selected from 48 articles screened and were full-text reviewed. The efficacy of both artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) ranged from moderate to high, with polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates ranging from 96.7 to 100% and 88.2 to 100%, respectively, in per-protocol analysis, and 86.2 to 96.7% and 74.0 to 90.6%, respectively, in intention-to-treat analysis. The malaria evidence network suggested that AL and ASAQ efficacies were comparable. The highest day 3 parasite positivity rate was 8.2% for ASAQ and 4% for AL. A novel ACT, artesunate-atovaquoneproguanil (ASATPG) was tested once and showed a cure rate of 100%. Based on an ITT approach, the NMA revealed that AL was more efficacious than ASAQ, but the difference was not statistical significant (706 participants, three randomised clinical trials (RCT); OR 1.25, 95%CI 0.78-2.00). Adverse events ranged from mild to moderate severity but were not directly attributed to drug intake.ConclusionACTs are still effective and safe in Cameroon; however, there are insufficient data on their efficacy, safety and tolerability, therefore more RCTs should be conducted, including novel ACTs.

TI Evidence of multiple point mutations in Theileria annulata cytochrome b
   gene incriminated in buparvaquone treatment failure
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Drug resistance is one of the emerging and re-emerging epidemics affecting both veterinary and public health sectors. Buparvaquone provides the most satisfactory means in the treatment of bovine tropical theileriosis. However, recently there has been widespread reports of development of resistance of Theileria annulata to buparvaquone. To investigate the situation in Sudan where bovine tropical theileriosis is endemic, fifty blood samples from T. annulata-positive cattle. were used for DNA extraction, PCR and cytochrome b gene nucleotide sequencing. Analysis of the two buparvaquone binding site regions Q(01) (130-148) and Q(02) (244-266), revealed three non-synonymous mutations at codon 146; alanine (GCT) to threonine (ACT) within the Q(01) region across all 50 isolates and the other mutation at codon 129; serine (AGC) to glycine (GGC) in 18 isolates which is very close to the Q(01) binding site. However, we documented another mutation at position 227; valine (GTG) to methionine (ATG) close to the close to the Q(02) binding site, in three isolates with mutation at codon 129. We concluded that this study has provided evidence of point mutations in the cytochrome b gene of T. annulata that might be associated with buparvaquone treatment failure in Sudan.

TI Genetic diversity of Merozoite Surface Protein-1 gene block 2 allelic
   types in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Malaysia and Thailand
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Malaria is the most common vector-borne parasitic disease in Malaysia and Thailand, especially in Malayan Borneo and along the Thailand border areas, but little is known about the genetic diversity of the parasite. Present study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium. falciparum isolates in these two countries and eventually contributes to more effective malaria control strategies, particularly in vaccine and antimalarial treatment. One hundred and seventy three P. falciparum isolates were collected from Malaysia (n = 67) and Thailand (n = 106) and genotyped using nested PCR targeting the polymorphic region of MSP-1, block 2. Sequence analysis was conducted to investigate the allele diversity of the isolates. Three allelic families were identified in Malaysian and Thailand P. falciparum. isolates, MAD20, K1 and RO33. Sequence analysis revealed that there were 5 different MAD20, 1 K1 and 2 different RO33 for Malaysian isolates. Thailand isolates exhibited greater polymorphism because there were 13 different MAD20, 6 different K1 and 2 different RO33 identified in this study. Multiclonal infections were observed for the isolates in both countries, however, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) was observed for Malaysian (1.1) and Thailand (1.2) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. falciparum isolates of Malaysia and Thailand were clustered in the same group for all the allelic families. Population structure of P. falciparum isolates in Malaysia and Thailand exhibit extensive genetic polymorphism but showed high similarities as well as comparable MOI.

TI Investigation of possible rickettsial infection in patients with malaria
SO TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB Rickettsioses are a common health problem in many geographical areas, including rural areas in Southeast Asia. Co-infection of rickettsioses and malaria has been reported in Africa, where common reservoir and vectors are available. In this study, blood samples of Malaysian patients microscopically positive (n=148) and negative (n=88) for malaria parasites (Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium, vivax) were screened for the presence of rickettsial DNA, using PCR assays targeting specific genes. A partial fragment of rickettsial ompB gene was successfully amplified and sequenced from a patient microscopically positive for Plasmodium spp. and PCR-positive for P vivax. BLAST analysis of the ompB sequence demonstrated the highest sequence similarity (99.7% similarity, 408/409nt) with Rickettsia sp. RF2125 (Genbank accession no. JX183538) and 91.4% (374/409 nt) similarity with Rickettsia fells URRWXCal2 (Genbank accession no. CP000053). This study reports rickettsia! infection in a malaria patient for the first time in the Southeast Asia region.

TI The prevalence and antifolate drug resistance profiles of Plasmodium
   falciparum in study participants randomized to discontinue or continue
   cotrimoxazole prophylaxis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Objective Cotrimoxazole prevents opportunistic infections including falciparum malaria in HIV-infected individuals but there are concerns of cross-resistance to other antifolate drugs such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). In this study, we investigated the prevalence of antifolate-resistance mutations in Plasmodium falciparum that are associated with SP resistance in HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral treatment randomized to discontinue (STOP-CTX), or continue (CTX) cotrimoxazole in Western Kenya.
   Design Samples were obtained from an unblinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial where participants were recruited on a rolling basis for the first six months of the study, then followed-up for 12 months with samples collected at enrollment, quarterly, and during sick visits.
   Method Plasmodium DNA was extracted from blood specimens. Initial screening to determine the presence of Plasmodium spp. was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR, followed by genotyping for the presence of SP-resistance associated mutations by Sanger sequencing.
   Results The prevalence of mutant haplotypes associated with SP-resistant parasites in pfdhfr (51I/59R/108N) and pfdhps (437G/540E) genes were significantly higher (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.027, respectively) in STOP-CTX compared to CTX arm. The prevalence of quintuple haplotype (51I/59R/108N/437G/540E) was 51.8% in STOP-CTX vs. 6.3% (P = 0.0007) in CTX arm. There was a steady increase in mutant haplotypes in both genes in STOP-CTX arm overtime through the study period, reaching statistical significance (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion The frequencies of mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were higher in STOP-CTX arm compared to CTX arm, suggesting cotrimoxazole effectively controls and selects against SP-resistant parasites.

TI Duffy antigen typing as an indirect method to identify asymptomatic
   malaria individuals
SO ACTA BIOQUIMICA CLINICA LATINOAMERICANA
AB Despite the strategies carried out annually for the control and eradication in countries considered endemic for malaria, there are isolated outbreaks probably due to asymptomatic carriers. These involve the presence of individuals with Duffy negative phenotype or population movements. The neighbourhood "50 casas" of the province of Esmeraldas-Ecuador has all these characteristics, so the purpose of this research was to determine the presence of the Fy(a-b-) phenotype and its relationship with the Plasmodium vivax. A survey was carried out into each member of the participating families and after accepting and signing the informed consent, blood samples were taken to perform serological tests in search of antibodies and antigens of P. vivax. The phenotyping of Duffy system and real-time PCR tests for DNA determination of Plasmodium vivax and falciparum was realized. The results showed that there is a statistically significant association between the Duffy phenotype and P. vivax malaria (p<0.05). In view of this situation, the control agencies should propose new strategies for the detection of asymptomatic carriers and preventive measures to hinder new outbreaks of malaria and determine if P. vivax has found a new invasion mechanism in individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype.

SO PARASITOLOGY
AB A sizeable proportion of households is forced to share single long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN). However, the relationship between increasing numbers of people sharing a net and the risk for Plasmodium infection is unclear. This study revealed whether risk for Plasmodium falciparum infection is associated with the number of people sharing a LLIN in a holoendemic area of Kenya. Children <= 5 years of age were tested for P. falciparum infection using polymerase chain reaction. Of 558 children surveyed, 293 (52.5%) tested positive for parasitaemia. Four hundred and fifty-eight (82.1%) reported sleeping under a LLIN. Of those, the number of people sharing a net with the sampled child ranged from 1 to 5 (median = 2). Children using a net alone or with one other person were at lower risk than non-users (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.82 and OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-0.97, respectively). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between non-users and children sharing a net with two (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.44-1.77) or more other persons (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.32-1.72). LLINs are effective in protecting against Plasmodium infection in children when used alone or with one other person compared with not using them. Public health professionals should inform caretakers of the risks of too many people sharing a net.

Public health professionals should inform caretakers of the risks of too many people sharing a net.

TI Longitudinal tracking and quantification of individual Plasmodium
   falciparum clones in complex infections
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Longitudinal tracking of individual Plasmodium falciparum strains in multi-clonal infections is essential for investigating infection dynamics of malaria. The traditional genotyping techniques did not permit tracking changes in individual clone density during persistent natural infections. Amplicon deep sequencing (Amp-Seq) offers a tool to address this knowledge gap. The sensitivity of Amp-Seq for relative quantification of clones was investigated using three molecular markers, ama1-D2, ama1-D3, and cpmp. Amp-Seq and length-polymorphism based genotyping were compared for their performance in following minority clones in longitudinal samples from Papua New Guinea. Amp-Seq markers were superior to length-polymorphic marker msp2 in detecting minority clones (sensitivity Amp-Seq: 95%, msp2: 85%). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2. The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds. Individual clone densities were tracked longitudinally by Amp-Seq despite MOI > 1, thus providing an additional parameter for investigating malaria infection dynamics. Amp-Seq based genotyping of longitudinal samples improves detection of minority clones and estimates of MOI. Amp-Seq permits tracking of clone density over time to study clone competition or the dynamics of specific, i.e. resistance-associated genotypes.

TI Behavior and abundance of Anopheles darlingi in communities living in
   the Colombian Amazon riverside
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the past few years, relative frequencies of malaria parasite species in communities living in the Colombian Amazon riverside have changed, being Plasmodium vivax (61.4%) and Plasmodium malariae (43.8%) the most frequent. Given this epidemiological scenario, it is important to determine the species of anophelines involved in these parasites' transmission. This study was carried out in June 2016 in two indigenous communities living close to the tributaries of the Amazon River using protected human bait. The results of this study showed a total abundance of 1,085 mosquitos, of which 99.2% corresponded to Anopheles darlingi. Additionally, only two anopheline species were found, showing low diversity in the study areas. Molecular confirmation of some individuals was then followed by evolutionary analysis by using the CO/gene. Nested PCR was used for identifying the three Plasmodium species circulating in the study areas. Of the two species collected in this study, 21.0% of the An. darlingi mosquitoes were infected with P. malariae, 21.9% with P. vivaxand 10.3% with Plasmodium falciparum. It exhibited exophilic and exophagic behavior in both study areas, having marked differences regarding its abundance in each community (Tipisca first sampling 49.4%, Tipisca second sampling 39.6% and Doce de Octubre 10.9%). Interestingly, An. mattogrossensis infected by P. vivax was found for the first time in Colombia (in 50% of the four females collected). Analysis of An. darlingi COI gene diversity indicated a single population maintaining a high gene flow between the study areas. The An. darlingi behavior pattern found in both communities represents a risk factor for the region's inhabitants living/working near these sites. This highlights the need for vector control efforts such as the use of personal repellents and insecticides for use on cattle, which must be made available in order to reduce this Anopheline's abundance.

TI A comparison of thick-film microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, and
   polymerase chain reaction for accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium
   falciparum malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundAccurate diagnosis of malaria is important for effective disease management and control. In Cameroon, presumptive clinical diagnosis, thick-film microscopy (TFM), and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are commonly used to diagnose cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, these methods lack sensitivity to detect low parasitaemia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), on the other hand, enhances the detection of sub-microscopic parasitaemia making it a much-needed tool for epidemiological surveys, mass screening, and the assessment of interventions for malaria elimination. Therefore, this study sought to determine the frequency of cases missed by traditional methods that are detected by PCR.MethodsBlood samples, collected from 551 febrile Cameroonian patients between February 2014 and February 2015, were tested for P. falciparum by microscopy, RDT and PCR. The hospital records of participants were reviewed to obtain data on the clinical diagnosis made by the health care worker.ResultsThe prevalence of malaria by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 31%, 45%, and 54%, respectively. However, of the 92% of participants diagnosed as having clinical cases of malaria by the health care worker, 38% were malaria-negative by PCR. PCR detected 23% and 12% more malaria infections than microscopy and RDT, respectively. A total of 128 (23%) individuals had sub-microscopic infections in the study population. The sensitivity of microscopy, RDT, and clinical diagnosis was 57%, 78% and 100%; the specificity was 99%, 94%, and 17%; the positive predictive values were 99%, 94%, and 59%; the negative predictive values were 66%, 78%, and 100%, respectively. Thus, 41% of the participants clinically diagnosed as having malaria had fever caused by other pathogens.ConclusionsMalaria diagnostic methods, such as TFM and RDT missed 12-23% of malaria cases detected by PCR. Therefore, traditional diagnostic approaches (TFM, RDT and clinical diagnosis) are not adequate when accurate epidemiological data are needed for monitoring malaria control and elimination interventions.

TI Detection of Plasmodium falciparum infected Anopheles gambiae using
   near-infrared spectroscopy
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Large-scale surveillance of mosquito populations is crucial to assess the intensity of vector-borne disease transmission and the impact of control interventions. However, there is a lack of accurate, cost-effective and high-throughput tools for mass-screening of vectors.
   Methods: A total of 750 Anopheles gambiae (Keele strain) mosquitoes were fed Plasmodium falciparum NF54 gametocytes through standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) and afterwards maintained in insectary conditions to allow for oocyst (8days) and sporozoite development (14days). Thereupon, each mosquito was scanned using near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) and processed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine the presence of infection and infection load. The spectra collected were randomly assigned to either a training dataset, used to develop calibrations for predicting oocyst- or sporozoite-infection through partial least square regressions (PLS); or to a test dataset, used for validating the calibration's prediction accuracy.
   Results: NIRS detected oocyst- and sporozoite-stage P. falciparum infections with 88% and 95% accuracy, respectively. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that NIRS is capable of rapidly identifying laboratory strains of human malaria infection in African mosquito vectors.
   Conclusions: Accurate, low-cost, reagent-free screening of mosquito populations enabled by NIRS could revolutionize surveillance and elimination strategies for the most important human malaria parasite in its primary African vector species. Further research is needed to evaluate how the method performs in the field following adjustments in the training datasets to include data from wild-caught infected and uninfected mosquitoes.

TI Limited genetic variability of Cytauxzoon felis apical membrane
   antigen-1 (ama1) from domestic cats and bobcats
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundCytauxzoon felis is a tick-transmitted apicomplexan that causes cytauxzoonosis in domestic cats (Felis catus). Even with intensive care, the mortality rate of acute cytauxzoonosis approaches 40% in domestic cats, while bobcats (Lynx rufus), the natural intermediate host of C. felis, remain clinically asymptomatic. However, multiple reports of domestic cats surviving acute disease without any treatment exist. One hypothesis for survival of these cats is infection with unique C. felis genotypes of lower pathogenicity. Prior studies have identified genetically distinct C. felis isolates containing polymorphisms within internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of the rRNA operon. However, these polymorphisms do not correlate with the clinical outcome of cytauxzoonosis, and so additional genetic markers are needed to test this hypothesis. We selected C. felis apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1) as a potential genetic marker of differential pathogenicity. AMA1 is a vaccine candidate for relatives of C. felis within Plasmodium spp.; however its historically high level of genetic polymorphism has resulted in escape from vaccine-induced immunity. While such diversity has hindered vaccine development, the expected polymorphism within theama1 genemay be useful to evaluate population genetics.ResultsA 677 bp sequence of the C. felisama1 gene was PCR-amplified from 84 domestic cats and 9 bobcats and demonstrated 99.9% sequence identity across all samples. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified in domestic cats and bobcats with evidence for co-infection with both genotypes identified in two domestic cats. The prevalence of the two genotypes varied with geographical distribution in domestic cats. Nucleotide diversity () and haplotype diversity (H) were calculated for C. felis ama1 and ama1 of related apicomplexans to assess genetic diversity. Based on these values (=0.00067 and H=0.457), the diversity of the C. felis ama1 gene region analyzed is considerably lower than what is documented in related apicomplexans.ConclusionsIn surprising contrast to related apicomplexans, our results support that the sequence of the C. felis ama1 gene is highly conserved. While lack of genetic diversity limits utility of C. felis AMA1 as a genetic marker for clinical outcome, it supports further investigation as a vaccine candidate for cytauxzoonosis.

TI Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of
   uncomplicated malaria and prevalence of Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 polymorphisms
   after a decade of using artemisinin-based combination therapy in
   mainland Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The World Health Organization recommends regular therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) to monitor the performance of first and second-line anti-malarials. In 2016, efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria were assessed through a TES conducted between April and October 2016 at four sentinel sites of Kibaha, Mkuzi, Mlimba, and Ujiji in Tanzania. The study also assessed molecular markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine (partner drug) resistance.
   Methods: Eligible patients were enrolled at the four sites, treated with standard doses of AL, and monitored for 28 days with clinical and laboratory assessments. The main outcomes were PCR corrected cure rates, day 3 positivity rates, safety of AL, and prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (Pfk13) (codon positions: 440-600) and P. falciparum multi-drug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes (codons: N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y), markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance, respectively.
   Results: Of 344 patients enrolled, three withdrew, six were lost to follow-up; and results were analysed for 335 (97.4%) patients. Two patients had treatment failure (one early treatment failure and one recrudescent infection) after PCR correction, yielding an adequate clinical and parasitological response of > 98%. Day 3 positivity rates ranged from 0 to 5.7%. Common adverse events included cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Two patients had serious adverse events; one died after the first dose of AL and another required hospitalization after the second dose of AL (on day 0) but recovered completely. Of 344 samples collected at enrolment (day 0), 92.7% and 100% were successfully sequenced for Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 genes, respectively. Six (1.9%) had non-synonymous mutations in Pfk13, none of which had been previously associated with artemisinin resistance. For Pfmdr1, the NFD haplotype (codons N86, 184F and D1246) was detected in 134 (39.0%) samples; ranging from 33.0% in Mlimba to 45.5% at Mkuzi. The difference among the four sites was not significant (p = 0.578). All samples had a single copy of the Pfmdr1 gene.
   Conclusion: The study indicated high efficacy of AL and the safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There were no known artemisinin-resistance Pfk13 mutations, but there was a high prevalence of a Pfmdr1 haplotype associated with reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine (but no reduced efficacy was observed in the subjects). Continued TES and monitoring of markers of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs is critical for early detection of resistant parasites and to inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies.

TI Malaria epidemiology and comparative reliability of diagnostic tools in
   Bannu; an endemic malaria focus in south of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB The present study was aimed at elucidation of malaria epidemiology and comparing performance of several diagnostic procedures in Bannu, a highly endemic district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
   Dried blood spots were collected from patients suspected of malaria visiting a hospital and two private laboratories in district Bannu and processed for species-specific PCR (rRNA). Patients were also screened for malaria through microscopy and RDT. A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect patient information to assess risk factors for malaria.
   Of 2033 individuals recruited, 21.1% (N = 429) were positive for malaria by at least one method. Overall, positivity detected by PCR was 30.5% (95/311) followed by 17.7% by microscopy (359/2033) and 16.4% by RDT (266/1618). Plasmodium vivax (16.9%, N = 343) was detected as the dominant species followed by Plasmodium falciparum (2.3%, N = 47) and mixed infections (1.2%, N = 39). Microscopy and RDT (Cohen's kappa k = 0.968, p = <0.0001, McNemar test p = 0.069) displayed significant agreement with each other. Satisfactory health, sleeping indoors, presence of health-care facility in vicinity (at an accessible range from home), living in upper middle class and in concrete houses significantly reduced malaria risk; whereas, low literacy level, presence of domestic animals indoors and malaria diagnosis recommended by clinician increased the disease risk.
   Overall, findings from the study provide reasonable basis for use of RDT as a cost-effective screening tool in field and for clinicians who can proceed with timely treatment of malaria patients. Appropriate management of identified risk factors could contribute to reduction of malaria prevalence in Bannu and its peripheries.

TI Field evaluation of malaria malachite green loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification in health posts in Roraima state, Brazil
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMicroscopic detection of malaria parasites is the standard method for clinical diagnosis of malaria in Brazil. However, malaria epidemiological surveillance studies specifically aimed at the detection of low-density infection and asymptomatic cases will require more sensitive and field-usable tools. The diagnostic accuracy of the colorimetric malachite green, loop-mediated, isothermal amplification (MG-LAMP) assay was evaluated in remote health posts in Roraima state, Brazil.MethodsStudy participants were prospectively enrolled from health posts (healthcare-seeking patients) and from nearby villages (healthy participants) in three different study sites. The MG-LAMP assay and microscopy were performed in the health posts. Two independent readers scored the MG-LAMP tests as positive (blue/green) or negative (clear). Sensitivity and specificity of local microscopy and MG-LAMP were calculated using results of PET-PCR as a reference.ResultsA total of 91 participants were enrolled. There was 100% agreement between the two MG-LAMP readers (Kappa=1). The overall sensitivity and specificity of MG-LAMP were 90.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 76.34-97.21%) and 94% (95% CI 83.76-98.77%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of local microscopy were 83% (95% CI 67.22-92.66%) and 100% (95% CI 93.02-100.00%), respectively. PET-PCR detected six mixed infections (infection with both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax); two of these were also detected by MG-LAMP and one by microscopy. Microscopy did not detect any Plasmodium infection in the 26 healthy participants; MG-LAMP detected Plasmodium in five of these and PET-PCR assay detected infection in three. Overall, performing the MG-LAMP in this setting did not present any particular challenges.ConclusionMG-LAMP is a sensitive and specific assay that may be useful for the detection of malaria parasites in remote healthcare settings. These findings suggest that it is possible to implement simple molecular tests in facilities with limited resources.

TI High cure rates and tolerability of artesunate-amodiaquine and
   dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated
   falciparum malaria in Kibaha and Kigoma, Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe Tanzanian National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) and its partners have been implementing regular therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) to monitor the performance of different drugs used or with potential use in Tanzania. However, most of the recent TES focused on artemether-lumefantrine, which is the first-line anti-malarial for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Data on the performance of other artemisinin-based combinations is urgently needed to support timely review and changes of treatment guidelines in case of drug resistance to the current regimen. This study was conducted at two NMCP sentinel sites (Kibaha, Pwani and Ujiji, Kigoma) to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), which are the current alternative artemisinin-based combinations in Tanzania.MethodsThis was a single-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses of ASAQ and DP for directly observed treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Children aged 6months to 10years and meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated with either ASAQ or DP. In each site, patients were enrolled sequentially; thus, enrolment of patients for the assessment of one artemisinin-based combination was completed before patients were recruited for assessment of the second drugs. Follow-up was done for 28 or 42days for ASAQ and DP, respectively. The primary outcome was PCR corrected cure rates while the secondary outcome was occurrence of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).ResultsOf the 724 patients screened at both sites, 333 (46.0%) were enrolled and 326 (97.9%) either completed the 28/42days of follow-up, or attained any of the treatment outcomes. PCR uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) for DP on day 42 was 98.8% and 75.9% at Kibaha and Ujiji, respectively. After PCR correction, DP's ACPR was 100% at both sites. For ASAQ, no parasite recurrence occurred giving 100% ACPR on day 28. Only one patient in the DP arm (1.1%) from Ujiji had parasites on day 3. Of the patients recruited (n=333), 175 (52.6%) had AEs with 223 episodes (at both sites) in the two treatment groups. There was no SAE and the commonly reported AE episodes (with>5%) included, cough, running nose, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever.ConclusionBoth artemisinin-based combinations had high cure rates with PCR corrected ACPR of 100%. The two drugs had adequate safety with no SAE and all AEs were mild, and not associated with the anti-malarials. Continued TES is critical to monitor the performance of nationally recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy and supporting evidence-based review of malaria treatment policies.Trial registration This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, No. NCT03431714

TI High prevalence of Pfdhfr-Pfdhps quadruple mutations associated with
   sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates
   from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundSulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in Africa. However, increasing SP resistance (SPR) affectsthe therapeutic efficacy of the SP. As molecular markers, Pfdhfr (dihydrofolate reductase) and Pfdhps (dihydropteroate synthase) genes are widely used for SPR surveillance. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes mutations and haplotypes in Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG).MethodsIn total, 180 samples were collected in 2013-2014. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were identified with nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. The genotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) tests were also analysed.ResultsSequences of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were obtained from 92.78% (167/180) and 87.78% (158/180) of the samples, respectively. For Pfdhfr, 97.60% (163/167), 87.43% (146/167) and 97.01% (162/167) of the samples carried N51I, C59R and S108N mutant alleles, respectively. The prevalence of the Pfdhps S436A, A437G, K540E, A581G, and A613S mutations were observed in 20.25% (32/158), 90.51% (143/158), 5.06% (8/158), 0.63% (1/158), and 3.16% (5/158) of the samples, respectively. In total, 3 unique haplotypes at the Pfdhfr locus and 8 haplotypes at the Pfdhps locus were identified. A triple mutation (CIRNI) in Pfdhfr was the most prevalent haplotype (86.83%), and a single mutant haplotype (SGKAA; 62.66%) was predominant in Pfdhps. A total of 130 isolates with 12 unique haplotypes were found in the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps combined haplotypes, 65.38% (85/130) of them carried quadruple allele combinations (CIRNI-SGKAA), whereas only one isolate (0.77%, 1/130) was found to carry the wild-type (CNCSI-SAKAA). For LD analysis, the Pfdhfr N51I was significantly associated with the Pfdhps A437G (P<0.05).ConclusionBioko Island possesses a high prevalence of the Pfdhfr triple mutation (CIRNI) and Pfdhps single mutation (SGKAA), which will undermine the pharmaceutical effect of SP for malaria treatment strategies. To avoid an increase in SPR, continuous molecular monitoring and additional control efforts are urgently needed in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.

TI Accuracy of malaria diagnosis by clinical laboratories in Belgium
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe Belgian Reference Laboratory for Plasmodium offers a free-of-charge reference testing of malaria-positive or doubtful samples to clinical laboratories.MethodsThe final malaria diagnosis from the Reference Laboratory (microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and Plasmodium species-specific PCR) were compared with the final diagnosis from peripheral Belgian laboratories. The Reference Laboratory reports were analysed for all samples submitted between 2013 and 2017. Criteria assessed included the diagnosis of malaria, Plasmodium species identification including mixed infections, and in case of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite density and the presence of sexual and asexual stages.ResultsA total of 947 non-duplicate samples were included. Reference testing confirmed 96.3% (893/927) and 90.0% (18/20) samples submitted as positive and negative, respectively, the two missed diagnoses were samples with Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. Submitting laboratories had correctly identified P. falciparum in 95.1% (508/534) samples with P. falciparum single infection. They had correctly diagnosed the species in 62.9% (95/151) single non-falciparum samples and had reported non-falciparum' in another 26 (17.2%) samples; most errors occurred among P. malariae (n=8/21, 38.1%) and P. ovale (n=14/51, 27.5%). Only one of the 21 mixed Plasmodium species infections had been diagnosed as such by the submitting laboratories; in three of them, P. falciparum had been overlooked. Taken single and mixed infections together, P. falciparum was diagnosed in 98.6% (546/554) samples. Among 471 single P. falciparum samples available for comparison, laboratories had correctly reported parasite densities above 2% in 87.5% (70/80) samples; they had incorrectly reported parasite densities>2% in an extra 52 (8.9%) samples. Laboratories had correctly reported P. falciparum schizonts and gametocytes in 25.6% (11/43) and 56.7% (17/30) samples, respectively.ConclusionDiagnostic laboratories in a malaria non-endemic setting provided excellent diagnosis of malaria and P. falciparum, reasonably good diagnosis of non-falciparum infections and acceptable calculation of P. falciparum parasite density.

TI Molecular epidemiology of residual Plasmodium vivax transmission in a
   paediatric cohort in Solomon Islands
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundFollowing the scale-up of intervention efforts, malaria burden has decreased dramatically in Solomon Islands (SI). Submicroscopic and asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax infections are now the major challenge for malaria elimination in this country. Since children have higher risk of contracting malaria, this study investigated the dynamics of Plasmodium spp. infections among children including the associated risk factors of residual P. vivax burden.MethodsAn observational cohort study was conducted among 860 children aged 0.5-12years in Ngella (Central Islands Province, SI). Children were monitored by active and passive surveillances for Plasmodium spp. infections and illness. Parasites were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and genotyped. Comprehensive statistical analyses of P. vivax infection prevalence, molecular force of blood stage infection (molFOB) and infection density were conducted.ResultsPlasmodium vivax infections were common (overall prevalence: 11.9%), whereas Plasmodium falciparum infections were rare (0.3%) but persistent. Although children acquire an average of 1.1 genetically distinct P. vivax blood-stage infections per year, there was significant geographic heterogeneity in the risks of P. vivax infections across Ngella (prevalence: 1.2-47.4%, p<0.01; molFOB: 0.05-4.6/year, p<0.01). Malaria incidence was low (IR: 0.05 episodes/year-at-risk). Age and measures of high exposure were the key risk factors for P. vivax infections and disease. Malaria incidence and infection density decreased with age, indicating significant acquisition of immunity. G6PD deficient children (10.8%) that did not receive primaquine treatment had a significantly higher prevalence (aOR: 1.77, p=0.01) and increased risk of acquiring new bloodstage infections (molFOB aIRR: 1.51, p=0.03), underscoring the importance of anti-relapse treatment.ConclusionResidual malaria transmission in Ngella exhibits strong heterogeneity and is characterized by a high proportion of submicroscopic and asymptomatic P. vivax infections, alongside sporadic P. falciparum infections. Implementing an appropriate primaquine treatment policy to prevent P. vivax relapses and specific targeting of control interventions to high risk areas will be required to accelerate ongoing control and elimination activities.

TI The temporal dynamics and infectiousness of subpatent Plasmodium
   falciparum infections in relation to parasite density
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Malaria infections occurring below the limit of detection of standard diagnostics are common in all endemic settings. However, key questions remain surrounding their contribution to sustaining transmission and whether they need to be detected and targeted to achieve malaria elimination. In this study we analyse a range of malaria datasets to quantify the density, detectability, course of infection and infectiousness of subpatent infections. Asymptomatically infected individuals have lower parasite densities on average in low transmission settings compared to individuals in higher transmission settings. In cohort studies, subpatent infections are found to be predictive of future periods of patent infection and in membrane feeding studies, individuals infected with subpatent asexual parasite densities are found to be approximately a third as infectious to mosquitoes as individuals with patent (asexual parasite) infection. These results indicate that subpatent infections contribute to the infectious reservoir, may be long lasting, and require more sensitive diagnostics to detect them in lower transmission settings.

TI Malaria infection rates in Anopheles albimanus (Diptera: Culicidae) at
   Ipeti-Guna, a village within a region targeted for malaria elimination
   in Panama
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The Panama Canal construction encompassed one of the first examples of malaria elimination. Nevertheless, malaria has uninterruptedly persisted in Native American populations living within a few kilometers of the Panama Canal. Here, we present results from a monthly longitudinal study (May 2016 to March 2018), whose goal was to quantitatively describe seasonal patterns of Plasmodium spp. infection in Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann, and its association with environmental covariates, at Ipeti-Guna, a village within a region targeted for malaria elimination in Panama. To detect Plasmodium spp. infections we employed a standard nested PCR on DNA extracts from mosquito pools of varying size, which were then used to estimate monthly infection rates using a maximum likelihood method. The infection rate estimates (IR) were analyzed using time series analysis methods to study their association with changes in rainfall, temperature, NDVI (a satellite derived vegetation index), malaria cases and human biting rates (HBR). We found that mosquitoes were infected by Plasmodium vivax mainly from September to December, reaching a peak in December. Time series modeling showed malaria IR in An albimanus increased, simultaneously with HBR, and IR in the previous month. These results suggest that elimination interventions, such as mass drug administration, are likely to be more effective if deployed from the middle to the end of the dry season (March and April at Ipeti-Guna), when the likelihood of malaria infection in mosquitoes is very low and when curtailing human infections driving infections in mosquitoes can reduce malaria transmission, and increase the chance for elimination.

TI Non-invasive surveillance of Plasmodium infection by real-time PCR
   analysis of ethanol preserved faeces from Ugandan school children with
   intestinal schistosomiasis
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundAs part of ongoing co-surveillance of intestinal schistosomiasis and malaria in Ugandan school children, a non-invasive detection method for amplification of Plasmodium DNA using real-time (rt)PCR analysis of ethanol preserved faeces (EPF) was assessed. For diagnostic tabulations, results were compared to rtPCR analysis of dried blood spots (DBS) and field-based point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).MethodsA total of247 school children from 5 primary schools along the shoreline of Lake Albert were examined with matched EPF and DBS obtained. Mean prevalence and prevalence by school was calculated by detection of Plasmodium DNA by rtPCR using a 18S rDNA Taqman((R)) probe. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were tabulated and compared against RDTs.ResultsBy rtPCR of EPF and DBS, 158 (63.9%; 95% CI 57.8-69.7) and 198 (80.1%, 95% CI 74.7-84.6) children were positive for Plasmodium spp. By RDT, 138 (55.8%; 95% CI 49.6-61.9) and 45 (18.2%; 95% CI 13.9-23.5) children were positive for Plasmodium falciparum, andwith non-P. falciparum co-infections, respectively. Using RDT results as a convenient field-based reference, the sensitivity of rtPCR of EPF and DBS was 73.1% (95% CI 65.2-79.8) and 94.2% (95% CI 88.9-97.0) while specificity was 47.7% (95% CI 38.5-57.0) and 37.6% (95% CI 29.0-46.9), respectively. With one exception, school prevalence estimated by analysis of EPF was higher than that by RDT. Positive and negative predictive values were compared and discussed.ConclusionsIn this high transmission setting, EPF sampling with rtPCR analysishas satisfactory diagnostic performance in estimation of mean prevalence and prevalence by school upon direct comparison with POC-RDTs. Although analysis of EPF was judged inferior to that of DBS, it permits an alternative non-invasive sampling regime that could be implemented alongside general monitoring and surveillance for other faecal parasites. EPF analysis may also have future value in passive surveillance of low transmission settings.

TI The burden and epidemiology of polyparasitism among rural communities in
   Kano State, Nigeria
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background Parasitic infections constitute a major public health problem worldwide, particularly among underprivileged communities in developing countries including Nigeria. The present study aimed to determine the epidemiology of polyparasitism (multiple parasitic infections) among rural communities in Kano State, North Central Nigeria.
   Methods A total of 551 individuals were screened for the presence of intestinal, urogenital and blood parasites by using different diagnostic techniques. Demographic, socioeconomic, household and behavioural characteristics were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire.
   Results Overall, 84.0% (463/551) of the participants were found to be infected with at least one parasite species, with 51.2% (282/551) of them having polyparasitism. The most prevalent parasites were Plasmodium falciparum (60.6%) followed by Blastocystis sp. (29.2%) and hookworm (15.4%). No significant association was found between malaria and helminth infections (p>0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the presence of other family members who had intestinal polyparasitism (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.12; 95% CI=2.72, 6.24), walking barefoot outside (AOR=1.70; 95% CI=1.09, 2.63) and being male (AOR=1.74; 95% CI=1.14, 2.66) were the significant risk factors of intestinal polyparasitism among the population studied.
   Conclusion Polyparasitism is highly prevalent among rural communities in Kano State. Therefore, effective, sustainable and integrated control measures should be identified and implemented to significantly reduce the burden and consequences of these infections in rural Nigeria.

TI A Native Mixed Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax Malaria Case
   Molecularly Proven After 22 Years in Manisa, Turkey
SO MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes about 450.000 deaths every year, mostly in children around the world. The infection is seen in cases coming from abroad and may lead to deaths in Turkey. Many native P.falciparum malaria cases and deaths due to this infection were observed in Turkey during mid 1900's when malaria was epidemic. But only two native cases were reported in the last 50 years, both from Manisa. First case was a one-year old baby who has come to Manisa from Urfa with his family and has never been abroad. He has diagnosed with Plasmodium vivax malaria and treated with chloroquine and primaquine. A previously obtained thin blood film was examined and characteristic P.falciparum rings in red blood cells were observed and the case was published together with photographs as probable P.falciparum and P.vivax mixed infection. After this case, microscopists working in Malaria Control Unit of Manisa were informed about the differentiation of malaria species in thin blood samples. Soon afterward, another case who have never been abroad before were also diagnosed with P.falciparum and P.vivax mixed infection and this case was also published with photographs taken from thin blood samples. As molecular diagnostic methods were not improved and widespread in those years, it could not be applied in both cases. A Giemsa stained thin blood sample of the baby case was incidentally found 22 years afterwards and with the aim of molecular diagnosis, the blood sample on the slide previously processed for DNA isolation, then analysed with "FTD Malaria Differentiation (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg)" multiplex kit with real-time polymerase chain reaction by using probes special for P.falciparum, P.ovale, P.malariae, P.vivax species. DNA's belonging to P.falciparum and P.vivax were found to be positive, the case is molecularly proved to have P.falciparum and P.vivax mixed infection. This case indicated that Turkey is convenient for the expansion of P.falciparum malaria in terms of the climate and vectors and suggested that the potential danger may increase with the effects of global warming, wars and migrations and may jump to Europe over Turkey. The case which molecularly proved the existence of native P.falciparum malaria in the near future in Turkey, was presented to draw attention to the danger of this infection for Turkey and Europe.

TI Assessment of efficacy of palm polymerase chain reaction with
   microscopy, rapid diagnostic test and conventional polymerase chain
   reaction for diagnosis of malaria
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Purpose: Sensitive, specific, rapid and cost-effective technique for malaria diagnosis is need of the hour. Microscopy has been the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, but its interpersonnel variability and lack of sensitivity make it subjective test. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) has proven to be sensitive technique, but costly and time-consuming. Considering these factors, we have compared microscopy and cPCR with newly derives ultra-fast, portable PCR machine called Palm PCR. Materials and Methods: Palm PCR is arranged with three heat blocks precisely made for three stages of PCR cycles with 34 min for 1100 bp Plasmodium genus outer primer to amplify and 10 min each for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax inner primers of 120 bp and 205 bp, respectively. A total of 191 suspected samples were processed and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The area under ROC curve analysis for Palm PCR with reference standard microscopy for P. falciparum, P. vivax and Plasmodium was 0.8969, 0.9121 and 0.9116, respectively, and with reference standard cPCR was 1.0 for all of them. ROC curve area close of suggests that Palm PCR can be as significant as cPCR in malaria diagnosis. In fact, ultra-rapid amplification with same precision makes Palm PCR better technique than cPCR. Conclusion: Palm PCR is sensitive, rapid and works on battery with simple laboratory facility requirements. Portable electrophoresis and transilluminator combined with Palm PCR could be implemented as an important diagnostic tool in resource-limited and rural areas. Similar studies with wider parameters in rural areas will help us evaluate and maybe establish Palm PCR as PCR platform of choice for such specific set-ups.

TI Polymorphisms in Pvkelch12 and gene amplification of Pvplasmepsin4 in
   Plasmodium vivax from Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMutations in Pfkelch13 and Pfplasmepsin2/3 gene amplification are well-established markers for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, a widespread problem in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The Plasmodium vivax parasite population has experienced varying drug pressure dependent on local drug policies. We investigated the correlation between drug pressure from artemisinins and piperaquine and mutations in the P. vivax orthologous genes Pvkelch12 and Pvplasmepsin4 (Pvpm4), as candidate resistance markers.MethodsBlood samples from 734 P. vivax patients were obtained from Thailand (n=399), Lao PDR (n=296) and Cambodia (n=39) between 2007 and 2017. Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4 was amplified and sequenced to assess gene mutations. To assess PvPM4 gene amplification, a Taqman((R)) Real-Time PCR method was developed and validated. Selection of non-synonymous mutations was assessed by its ratio with synonymous mutations (Ka/Ks ratios). Mutation rates were compared to the estimated local drug pressure.ResultsPolymorphisms in Pvkelch12 were rare. Pvkelch12 mutations V552I, K151Q and M124I were observed in 1.0% (7/734) of P. vivax samples. V552I was the most common mutation with a frequency of 0.7% (5/734), most of which (4/5) observed in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. Polymorphisms in Pvpm4 were more common, with a frequency of 40.3% (123/305) in 305 samples from Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia, but this was not related to the estimated piperaquine drug pressure in these areas (Pearson's (2) test, p=0.50). Pvpm4 mutation V165I was most frequent in Tak, Thailand (40.2%, 43/107) followed by Pailin, Cambodia (43.5%, 37/85), Champasak, Lao PDR (40.4%, 23/57) and Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand (35.7%, 20/56). Pvpm4 amplification was not observed in 141 samples from Thailand and Cambodia. For both Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4, in all areas and at all time points, the Ka/Ks values were<1, suggesting no purifying selection.ConclusionsA novel real-time PCR-based method to assess P. vivax Pvpm4 gene amplification was developed. Drug pressure with artemisinins and piperaquine in the GMS was not clearly related to signatures of selection for mutations in the P. vivax orthologous resistance genes Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4 in areas under investigation. Current resistance of P. vivax to these drugs is unlikely and additional observations including analysis of associated clinical data from these regions could further clarify current findings.

TI Sensitive real-time PCR detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in
   whole blood by erythrocyte membrane protein 1 gene amplification
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria remains a global public health problem responsible for 445,000 deaths in 2016. While microscopy remains the mainstay of malaria diagnosis, highly sensitive molecular methods for detection of low-grade sub-microscopic infections are needed for surveillance studies and identifying asymptomatic reservoirs of malaria transmission.MethodsThe Plasmodium falciparum genome sequence was analysed to identify high copy number genes that improve P. falciparum parasite detection in blood by RT-PCR. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)-specific primers were evaluated for P. falciparum detection in hospital-based microscopically positive dried blood spots and field-acquired whole blood from asymptomatic individuals from Ghana.ResultsPfEMP1 outperformed the Pf18S sequence for amplification-based P. falciparum detection. PfEMP1 primers exhibited sevenfold higher sensitivity compared to Pf18S primers for parasite genomic DNA. Probit analysis established a 95% detection threshold of 9.3parasites/mL for PfEMP1 compared to 98.2parasites/mL for Pf18S primers. The PfEMP1 primers also demonstrated superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 100% (20/20) of dried blood spot samples and 70% (69/98) of asymptomatic individuals as positive versus 55% (11/20) and 54% (53/98), respectively, for Pf18S amplification.ConclusionsThese results establish PfEMP1 as a novel amplification target for highly sensitive detection of both acute infections from filter paper samples and submicroscopic asymptomatic low-grade infections.

TI Distribution of Plasmodium species and assessment of performance of
   diagnostic tools used during a malaria survey in Southern and Western
   Provinces of Zambia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundZambia continues to make strides in reducing malaria burden through the use of proven malaria interventions and has recently pledged to eliminate malaria by 2021. Case management services have been scaled up at community level with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) providing antigen-based detection of falciparum malaria only. Key to national malaria elimination goals is the ability to identify, treat and eliminate all Plasmodium species. This study sought to determine the distribution of non-falciparum malaria and assess the performance of diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum in Western and Southern Provinces of Zambia, two provinces planned for early malaria elimination.MethodsA sub-set of individuals' data and samples from a cross-sectional household survey, conducted during peak malaria transmission season in April and May 2017, was used. The survey collected socio-demographic information on household members and coverage of malaria interventions. Malaria testing was done on respondents of all ages using blood smears and RDTs while dried blood spots were collected on filter papers for analysis using photo-induced electron transfer polymerase chain reaction (PET-PCR). Slides were stained using Giemsa stain and examined by microscopy for malaria parasites.ResultsFrom the 1567 individuals included, the overall prevalence of malaria was 19.4% (CI 17.5-21.4) by PCR, 19.3% (CI 17.4-21.4) by RDT and 12.9% (CI 11.3-14.7) by microscopy. Using PET-PCR as the gold standard, RDTs showed a sensitivity of 75.7% (CI 70.4-80.4) and specificity of 94.2% (CI 92.8-95.4). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 75.9% (CI 70.7-80.6) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 94.1% (CI 92.1-95.4). In contrast, microscopy for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV values were 56.9% (CI 51.1-62.5), 97.7% (CI 96.7-98.5), 85.6% (CI 80.0-90.2), 90.4% (CI 88.7-91.9), respectively. Non-falciparum infections were found only in Western Province, where 11.6% of P. falciparum infections were co-infections with Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae.ConclusionFrom the sub-set of survey data analysed, non-falciparum species are present and occurred as mixed infections. As expected, PET-PCR was slightly more sensitive than both malaria RDTs and microscopy to detecting malaria infections.

TI Investigation and Evaluation of Genetic Diversity of Plasmodium
   falciparum Kelch 13 Polymorphisms Imported From Southeast Asia and
   Africa in Southern China
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives: In this study, we aimed to analyse the genetic diversity Kelch 13 (K13) propeller allele of the Plasmodium falciparum isolates mainly imported from Southeast Asia and Africa in southern China, including the provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi.
   Methods: At enrolment, we collected blood samples from patients with confirmed cases of malaria infection between January 2012 and December 2017, for analysis. Individual patient information was obtained via a malaria surveillance system. The malaria infections and P falciparum K13 mutations were diagnosed by using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
   Results: The K13 mutations were identified in 283 P falciparum isolates from 18 counties in Yunnan and 22 counties in Guangxi. Of Forty-six isolates (46/283, 16.3%) that harbored K13 mutant alleles were detected: 26.8% in Yunnan (33/123) and 8.1% in Guangxi (13/160). A total of 18 different K13 mutations were detected. Only the F446I mutation was detected in Yunnan isolates, and F4461 was more frequent (20/46, 43.5%) than other alleles. Further, the temporal distribution of the F446I mutation ratio from 2012 to 2015 exhibited no significant difference in Yunnan Province (2012, 2/13, 15.4%; 2013, 7/40, 17.5%; 2014, 7/33, 21.2%; 2015, 4/37, 10.8%, p = 0.121). A578S allele was the main K13 mutation (5/283, 1.8%) from Africa. The K13 mutants were present in 33.3% of indigenous isolates, 27.4% of isolates from Southeast Asia, and 7.9% of isolates from Africa. The analysis of 10 neutral microsatellite loci of 60 isolates showed that at the TAA109 locus, the expected heterozygosity of F446I (H-e = 0.112 +/- 0.007) was much lower than that of wild type and other mutation types in Myanmar isolates. With respect to geographic distribution, TAA109 also exhibited a significant difference between isolates from Southeast Asia (H-e = 0.139 +/- 0.012) and those from Africa (H-e = 0.603 +/- 0.044).
   Conclusions: The present findings on the geographic diversity of K13 mutant alleles in P falciparum may provide a basis for routine molecular surveillance and risk assessment, to monitor artemisinin resistance (ART) in China. Our results will be helpful for enriching the artemisinin resistance database in China during the elimination and post-elimination phases.

TI Demographical, hematological and serological risk factors for Plasmodium
   falciparum gametocyte carriage in a high stable transmission zone in
   Cameroon
SO PLOS ONE
AB Presence of mature gametocyte forms of malaria parasites in peripheral blood is a key requirement for malaria transmission. Yet, studies conducted in most malaria transmission zones report the absence of gametocyte in the majority of patients. We therefore sought to determine the risk factors of both all-stage and mature gametocyte carriage in an area with high stable transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. Gametocyte positivity was determined using three complementary methods: thick blood smear microscopy, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP, whereas exposure to the infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 361 malaria endemic residents randomly included in the study (mean age: 28 +/- 23 years, age range: 2-100 years, male/female sex ratio: 1.1), 87.8% were diagnosed with P. falciparum infection, of whom 45.7% presented with fever (axillary body temperatur >= 37.5 degrees C). Mature gametocyte positivity was 1.9% by thick blood smear microscopy and 8.9% by RT-PCR targeting the mature gametocyte transcript, Pfs25. The gametocyte positivity rate was 24.1% and 36.3% by RT-PCR or RT-LAMP, respectively, when targeting the sexual stage marker, Pfs16. Multivariate analyses revealed anemia as a common independent risk factor for both mature and all-stage gametocyte carriage, whereas fever and low anti-gametocyte antibody levels were independently associated with all-stage gametocyte carriage only. Taken together, the data suggest important differences in risk factors of gametocyte carriage depending on stage analyzed, with anemia, fever and low antiplasmodial plasma antibody levels representing the major contributing risk factors.

TI Involvement of Anopheles nili in Plasmodium falciparum transmission in
   North Benin
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundSeveral studies carried out in Benin have shown the involvement of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), the Anopheles funestus group in malaria transmission, but none of them reported the contribution of the Anopheles nili group to the transmission of this disease. The current study investigated the question through an entomological cross-sectional survey performed in Northern Benin.MethodsMosquito samplings were performed in September and October 2017 in 4 villages located in two districts: Bambaba and Wodara (Kerou district) and, Pehunco 2 and Beke (Pehunco district). The collections were carried out indoors and outdoors using human landing catches (HLC) to assess the human biting rate (HBR) and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) to evaluate the blood feeding rate and the blood meal origin using the ELISA test. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified and, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used for molecular identification of sibling species of An. gambiae s.l., An. funestus group and An. nili group sporozoite index (SI) was also assessed by the ELISA test.ResultsOverall, An. gambiae s.l., An. funestus group and An. nili group were the three vectors found in the study area. A significantly higher human biting rate (HBR) was recorded in An. nili group (5 bites/human/night) compared to An. funestus group (0.656 bites/human/night) in the Kerou district (p<0.0001). Anopheles gambiae s.l. displayed the highest HBR (26.19 bites/human/night) in the same district. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was 1.875 infected bites/human/month in An. nili group against 13.05 infected bites/human/month in An. gambiae s.l. and 0.938 infected bites/human/month in An. funestus group in Kerou. In Pehunco, the EIR was 1.02 infected bites/human/month in An. gambiae s.l. PCR results showed that An. nili sensu stricto (s.s.) and An. funestus s.s. were the only species of the An. nili and An. funestus groups, respectively. The anthropophagic character of An. gambiae s.l. was also highlighted.ConclusionThis study provides useful information on the contribution of An. nili group as secondary vector to malaria transmission in northern Benin. Broader studies must also be carried out in a larger study area to assess the involvement of other Anopheles species to malaria transmission. This will aid to better plan malaria vector control interventions.

TI Two cases of long-lasting, sub-microscopic Plasmodium malariae
   infections in adults from coastal Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria is endemic in Tanzania with majority of clinical cases caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Additionally, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp. are also present and clinical manifestations caused by these infections are not well described. Clinical episodes caused by P. malariae infections are often characterized by a relatively mild illness with a low number of parasites, which can persist for long periods. In this report, two cases of P. malariae infections that were identified during a clinical trial evaluating the P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidate, PfSPZ Vaccine are described. The two participants were followed up and monitored for clinical and laboratory parameters to assess vaccine safety providing the opportunity to study clinical manifestations of P. malariae over 4months.Case presentationTwo young, healthy Tanzanian men infected with low density asexual blood stage P. malariae diagnosed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are described. Retrospective analysis of collected and stored blood samples revealed that the two volunteers had constant asexual blood stage parasitaemia for more than 4months. During the 132days of infection, the volunteers' vital signs, body temperature and serum biochemistry all remained within normal ranges. Haematological abnormalities, which were transiently outside normal ranges, were regarded as not clinically significant. During this time period, four consecutive evaluations of blood samples by thick blood smear microscopy conducted by an experienced microscopist were all negative, indicating the presence of low-density sub-microscopic infections.ConclusionsThe two cases of P. malariae infections presented here confirm the ability of this Plasmodium species to persist at low density in the human host for extended time periods without causing clinical symptoms. The presented data also demonstrate that clinical study sites in malaria endemic regions need to have a strong malaria diagnostic infrastructure, including the ability of capturing sub-microscopic parasitaemia and differentiation of Plasmodium species.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02613520, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02613520, Registered: November 24th 2015, Enrolment of the first participant to the trial: December 15th 2015, Trial was registered before the first participant was enrolled

TI Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger (pfnhe1)
   polymorphisms among imported African malaria parasites isolated in
   Wuhan, Central China
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB BackgroundQuinine (QN) remains an effective drug for malaria treatment. However, quinine resistance (QNR) in Plasmodium falciparum has been reported in many malaria-endemic regions particularly in African countries. Genetic polymorphism of the P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger (pfnhe1) is considered to influence QN susceptibility. Here, ms4760 alleles of pfnhe1 were analysed from imported African P. falciparum parasites isolated from returning travellers in Wuhan, Central China.MethodsA total of 204 dried-blood spots were collected during 2011-2016. The polymorphisms of the pfnhe1 gene were determined using nested PCR with DNA sequencing.ResultsSequences were generated for 99.51% (203/204) of the PCR products and 68.63% (140/204) of the isolates were analysed successfully for the pfnhe1 ms4760 haplotypes. In total, 28 distinct ms4760 alleles containing 0 to 5 DNNND and 1 to 3 NHNDNHNNDDD repeats were identified. For the alleles, ms4760-1 (22.86%, 32/140), ms4760-3 (17.86%, 25/140), and ms4760-7 (10.71%, 15/140) were the most prevalent profiles. Furthermore, 5 undescribed ms4760 alleles were reported.ConclusionsThe study offers an initial comprehensive analysis of pfnhe1 ms4760 polymorphisms from imported P. falciparum isolates in Wuhan. Pfnhe1 may constitute a good genetic marker to evaluate the prevalence of QNR in malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions.

TI Ribosomal and non-ribosomal PCR targets for the detection of low-density
   and mixed malaria infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe unexpected high proportion of submicroscopic malaria infections in areas with low transmission intensity challenges the control and elimination of malaria in the Americas. The current PCR-based assays present limitations as most protocols still rely on amplification of few-copies target gene. Here, the hypothesis was that amplification of different plasmodial targetsribosomal (18S rRNA) and non-ribosomal multi-copy sequences (Pvr47 for Plasmodium vivax and Pfr364 for Plasmodium falciparum)could increase the chances of detecting submicroscopic malaria infection.MethodsA non-ribosomal real-time PCR assay targeting Pvr47/Pfr364 (NR-qPCR) was established and compared with three additional PCR protocols, two of them based on 18S rRNA gene amplification (Nested-PCR and R-qPCR) and one based on Pvr47/Pfr364 targets (NR-cPCR). The limit of detection of each PCR protocol, at single and artificial mixed P. vivax/P. falciparum infections, was determined by end-point titration curves. Field samples from clinical (n=110) and subclinical (n=324) malaria infections were used to evaluate the impact of using multiple molecular targets to detect malaria infections.ResultsThe results demonstrated that an association of ribosomal and non-ribosomal targets did not increase sensitivity to detect submicroscopic malaria infections. Despite of that, artificial mixed-malaria infections demonstrated that the NR-qPCR was the most sensitive protocol to detect low-levels of P. vivax/P. falciparum co-infections. Field studies confirmed that submicroscopic malaria represented a large proportion (up to 77%) of infections among asymptomatic Amazonian residents, with a high proportion of infections (similar to 20%) identified only by the NR-qPCR.ConclusionsThis study presents a new species-specific non-ribosomal PCR assay with potential to identify low-density P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. As the majority of subclinical infections was caused by P. vivax, the commonest form of malaria in the Amazon area, future studies should investigate the potential of Pvr47/Pfr364 to detect mixed-malaria infections in the field.

TI Sub-microscopic Plasmodium falciparum infections in matched peripheral,
   placental and umbilical cord blood samples from asymptomatic Congolese
   women at delivery
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB In malaria-endemic areas, most pregnant women are susceptible to asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections. We present here the results of a cross-sectional study conducted in Madibou, a southern district of Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo, between March 2014 and April 2015. The main aim was to characterize P. falciparum infections. Blood samples corresponding to peripheral, placental and cord from 370 asymptomatic malaria women at delivery were diagnosed for plasmodium infection by thick blood smears (microscopic infection). Sub-microscopic infection was detected by PCR, using the MSP-2 gene as marker. Microscopic infections were detected in peripheral, placental and cord blood samples with a prevalence of respectively 7.3% (27/370), 2.7% (10/370) and 0%. The negative samples were submitted to sub-microscopic detection, with respective prevalence of 25.4% (87/343), 16.7% (60/360) and 9.4% (35/370) (P < 0.001). We further investigated the genetic diversity of the parasite by characterizing MSP2 allelic families 3D7 (24 distinct alleles) and FC27 (20 distinct alleles). The total number of alleles for these two families were 31, 25 and 19 in peripheral, placental and cord samples respectively. The 3D7 MSP-2 was the predominant allelic family. The multiplicity of infections (MOI) in peripheral (mean 1.4 +/- 0.01; range 1-4), placental (mean 1.2 +/- 0.01; range 1-3) and cord samples (1.4 +/- 0.01; range 1-3) were similar (P = 0.9) and are unaffected by age, gravidity or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. These results shown a high prevalence of sub-microscopic infection and a high genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum strains in Congo. Age, gravidity and doses of preventive treatment based on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine do not interfere with the multiplicity of infections.

TI Molecular detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum in
   150-year-old foetal remains, southeastern France
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Purpose. Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, is considered as an old disease affecting humans; traces of such infections, including congenital syphilis, are potentially identifiable in archaeological samples. The aim of this research was to perform macroscopic and molecular investigations of T. pallidum on six infant remains, buried between 1837 and 1867, from the cemetery of 'Les Crottes' in Marseille city (southeastern France).
   Methodology. Pathological analysis of bones from individuals, aged from the twenty-ninth week of amenorrhea to 4-9 months, was performed. Samples served also as a source of ancient DNA (aDNA) for PCR-based molecular investigations targeting T. pallidum DNA; all samples were also tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum DNA. Sequences characterized were cloned and sequenced, and compared to those available in databases.
   Results/Key findings. All samples tested displayed widespread osteoporotic lesions across the skeleton possibly related to some metabolic or infectious disorders. Subsequent molecular analysis revealed that one individual, SP332 (unborn, 29 amenorrhea weeks, inhumation date 1864-1866), exhibited positive signals for the five T. pallidum amplification systems tested; sequence analysis provided strong evidence for the effective detection of T. pallidum subspecies pallidum DNA.
   Conclusions. Individual SP332 is the first PCR-confirmed palaeopathological case of syphilis identified in France, and the youngest specimen ever to be diagnosed with certainty for congenital syphilis. Future research aimed at better characterizing this 150-year-old treponeme genome and exploring new archaelogical cases of syphilis in the very young should contribute to a better comprehension of the disease's history.

TI Development and Evaluation of a Novel HNB Based Isothermal Amplification
   Assay for Fast Detection of Pyrimethamine Resistance (S108N) in
   Plasmodium falciparum
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP) have been used as long-acting partner antimalarial drugs in artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for falciparum malaria. The emergence and increasing spread of SP resistance in malaria-endemic areas have become a challenge for the control of malaria. Therefore, regular monitoring of the mutation status of partner drugs is important for the better management of drug policy. There are limitations with traditional molecular methods and there is an urgent need for an easy method for diagnosis of drug resistance. In this study we have introduced and developed a novel single nucleotide polymorphism loop-mediated isothermal amplification (SNP-LAMP) approach based on a hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) indicator for the easier and quicker detection of pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. To implement this novel approach, many sets of LAMP primers were designed and tested. Finally, one set of forward inner primer M1 (FIPM1) of LAMP primer was selected that specifically distinguishes pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum malaria. The LAMP reactions were optimized at 60-66 degrees C for 45 min. High sensitivity (7 parasites/mu L) was observed with 10(-4) fold dilutions (<2 ng DNA) of genomic DNA. Moreover, this approach has the potential to be applied even in laboratories unfamiliar with PCR or other molecular methods, and in future, this can be helpful for the better management of anti-malarial policy.

TI Highly heterogeneous residual malaria risk in western Thailand
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB Over the past decades, the malaria burden in Thailand has substantially declined. Most infections now originate from the national border regions. In these areas, the prevalence of asymptomatic infections is still substantial and poses a challenge for the national malaria elimination program. To determine epidemiological parameters as well as risk factors for malaria infection in western Thailand, we carried out a cohort study in Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi provinces on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Blood samples from 999 local participants were examined for malaria infection every 4 weeks between May 2013 and Jun 2014. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and showed a seasonal variation with values fluctuating from 1.7% to 4.2% for P. vivax and 0% to 1.3% for P. falciparum. Ninety percent of infections were asymptomatic. The annual molecular force of blood-stage infection (molFOB) was estimated by microsatellite genotyping to be 0.24 new infections per person-year for P. vivax and 0.02 new infections per person-year for P. falciparum. The distribution of infections was heterogenous, that is, the vast majority of infections (>80%) were found in a small number of individuals (<8% of the study population) who tested positive at multiple timepoints. Significant risk factors were detected for P. vivax infections, including previous clinical malaria, occupation in agriculture and travel to Myanmar. In contrast, indoor residual spraying was associated with a protection from infection. These findings provide a recent landscape of malaria epidemiology and emphasize the importance of novel strategies to target asymptomatic and imported infections.

TI Plasmodium vivax morbidity after radical cure: A cohort study in Central
   Vietnam
SO PLOS MEDICINE
AB Background In Vietnam, the importance of vivax malaria relative to falciparum during the past decade has steadily increased to 50%. This, together with the spread of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, is a major challenge for malaria elimination. A 2-year prospective cohort study to assess P. vivax morbidity after radical cure treatment and related risk factors was conducted in Central Vietnam.
   Methods and findings The study was implemented between April 2009 and December 2011 in four neighboring villages in a remote forested area of Quang Nam province. P. vivax-infected patients were treated radically with chloroquine (CQ; 25 mg/kg over 3 days) and primaquine (PQ; 0.5 mg/kg/day for 10 days) and visited monthly (malaria symptoms and blood sampling) for up to 2 years. Time to first vivax recurrence was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and risk factors for first and recurrent infections were identified by Cox regression models. Among the 260 P. vivax patients (61% males [159/260]; age range 3-60) recruited, 240 completed the 10-day treatment, 223 entered the second month of follow-up, and 219 were followed for at least 12 months. Most individuals (76.78%, 171/223) had recurrent vivax infections identified by molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]); in about half of them (55.61%, 124/223), infection was detected by microscopy, and 84 individuals (37.67%) had symptomatic recurrences. Median time to first recurrence by PCR was 118 days (IQR 59-208). The estimated probability of remaining free of recurrence by month 24 was 20.40% (95% CI [14.42; 27.13]) by PCR, 42.52% (95% CI [35.41; 49.44]) by microscopy, and 60.69% (95% CI [53.51; 67.11]) for symptomatic recurrences. The main risk factor for recurrence (first or recurrent) was prior P. falciparum infection. The main limitations of this study are the age of the results and the absence of a comparator arm, which does not allow estimating the proportion of vivax relapses among recurrent infections.
   Conclusion A substantial number of P. vivax recurrences, mainly submicroscopic (SM) and asymptomatic, were observed after high-dose PQ treatment (5.0 mg/kg). Prior P. falciparum infection was an important risk factor for all types of vivax recurrences. Malaria elimination efforts need to address this largely undetected P. vivax transmission by simultaneously tackling the reservoir of P. falciparum and P. vivax infections.

TI Molecular detection of P. vivax and P. ovale foci of infection in
   asymptomatic and symptomatic children in Northern Namibia
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background Knowledge of the foci of Plasmodium species infections is critical for a country with an elimination agenda. Namibia is targeting malaria elimination by 2020. To support decision making regarding targeted intervention, we examined for the first time, the foci of Plasmodium species infections and regional prevalence in northern Namibia, using nested and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods.
   Methods We used cross-sectional multi-staged sampling to select 952 children below 9 years old from schools and clinics in seven districts in northern Namibia, to assess the presence of Plasmodium species.
   Results The median participant age was 6 years (25-75%ile 4-8 y). Participants had a median hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL (25-75%ile 11.1-12.7 g/dL), although 21% of the cohort was anemic, with anemia being severer in the younger population (p<0.002). Most of children with Plasmodium infection were asymptomatic (63.4%), presenting a challenge for elimination. The respective parasite prevalence for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and Plasmodium ovale curtisi (Po) were (4.41%, 0.84% and 0.31%); with Kavango East and West (10.4%, 6.19%) and Ohangwena (4.5%) having the most prevalence. Pv was localized in Ohangwena, Omusati and Oshana, while Po was found in Kavango. All children with Pv/Pf coinfections in Ohangwena, had previously visited Angola, affirming that perennial migrations are risks for importation of Plasmodium species. The mean hemoglobin was lower in those with Plasmodium infection compared to those without (0.96 g/dL less, 95%CI 0.40-1.52 g/dL less, p = 0.0009) indicating that quasi-endemicity exists in the low transmission setting.
   Conclusions We conclude that Pv and Po species are present in northern Namibia. Additionally, the higher number of asymptomatic infections present challenges to the efforts at elimination for the country. Careful planning, coordination with neighboring Angola and execution of targeted active intervention, will be required for a successful elimination agenda.
   Author summary Namibia is a member of the SADC elimination 8 (E8) group with a target to eliminate malaria by 2020. This target stems from years of aggressive interventional strategies that has led to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. The focus of this strategy is mainly on Plasmodium falciparum as the primary parasite species. Foci of transmission is found in the northern border with Angola and Zambia, which also carries the highest population density. Recently as part of the elimination efforts to predict areas likely to have rebound epidemics, three regions Ohangwena, Kavango and Zambezi were identified. In order to affirm these findings and decision-making process for intervention, we assessed the parasite prevalence in 7 northern regional sites for four Plasmodium species. We identified Pv and Po curtisi parasites in Omusati, Ohangwena and Kavango, as well as a significant number of asymptomatic Pf and Pv infections, part of which may be due to importation from neighboring Angola. As Namibia is targeting elimination by 2020, careful thought and planning will be required to reach the goal.

TI Persistent transmission of Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale
   species in an area of declining Plasmodium falciparum transmission in
   eastern Tanzania
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB A reduction in the global burden of malaria over the past two decades has encouraged efforts for regional malaria elimination. Despite the need to target all Plasmodium species, current focus is mainly directed towards Plasmodium falciparum, and to a lesser extent P. vivax. There is a substantial lack of data on both global and local transmission patterns of the neglected malaria parasites P. malariae and P. ovale spp. We used a species-specific real-time PCR assay targeting the Plasmodium 18s rRNA gene to evaluate temporal trends in the prevalence of all human malaria parasites over a 22-year period in a rural village in Tanzania.We tested 2897 blood samples collected in five cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1994 and 2016. Infections with P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale spp. were detected throughout the study period, while P. vivax was not detected. Between 1994 and 2010, we found a more than 90% reduction in the odds of infection with all detected species. The odds of P. falciparum infection was further reduced in 2016, while the odds of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. infection increased 2- and 6-fold, respectively, compared to 2010. In 2016, non-falciparum species occurred more often as mono-infections. The results demonstrate the persistent transmission of P. ovale spp., and to a lesser extent P. malariae despite a continued decline in P. falciparum transmission. This illustrates that the transmission patterns of the non-falciparum species do not necessarily follow those of P. falciparum, stressing the need for attention towards non-falciparum malaria in Africa. Malaria elimination will require a better understanding of the epidemiology of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. and improved tools for monitoring the transmission of all Plasmodium species, with a particular focus towards identifying asymptomatic carriers of infection and designing appropriate interventions to enhance malaria control.
   Author summary The reduction in the global burden of malaria has encouraged efforts for elimination. Attempts to control and monitor transmission have mainly focused on the predominant malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. However, eliminating malaria requires the elimination of all human malaria parasites and limited interest has been directed towards estimating the disease burden attributable to the neglected malaria parasites P. ovale spp. and P. malariae. The authors used molecular methods to analyse 2897 blood samples collected in five cross-sectional surveys over a period of 22 years, and described the transmission patterns of all human malaria parasites in a Tanzanian village. They demonstrate a persistent transmission of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. despite a substantial reduction in transmission of P. falciparum, highlighting the need for more attention towards non-falciparum malaria. The authors discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current efforts for regional malaria elimination.

TI Diagnostic Performance of Conventional and Ultrasensitive Rapid
   Diagnostic Tests for Malaria in Febrile Outpatients in Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. A novel ultrasensitive malaria rapid diagnostic test (us-RDT) has been developed for improved active Plasmodium falciparum infection detection. The usefulness of this us-RDT in clinical diagnosis and fever management has not been evaluated.
   Methods. Diagnostic performance of us-RDT was compared retrospectively to that of conventional RDT (co-RDT) in 3000 children and 515 adults presenting with fever to Tanzanian outpatient clinics. The parasite density was measured by an ultrasensitive qPCR (us-qPCR), and the HRP2 concentration was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results. us-RDT identified few additional P. falciparum-positive patients as compared to co-RDT (276 vs 265 parasite-positive patients detected), with only a marginally greater sensitivity (75% vs 73%), using us-qPCR as the gold standard (357 parasite-positive patients detected). The specificity of both RDTs was > 99%. Five of 11 additional patients testing positive by us-RDT had negative results by us-qPCR. The HRP2 concentration was above the limit of detection for co-RDT (> 3653 pg of HRP2 per mL of blood) in almost all infections (99% [236 of 239]) with a parasite density > 100 parasites per mu L of blood. At parasite densities < 100 parasites/mu L, the HRP2 concentration was above the limits of detection of us-RDT (> 793 pg/mL) and co-RDT in 29 (25%) and 24 (20%) of 118 patients, respectively.
   Conclusion. There is neither an advantage nor a risk of using us-RDT, rather than co-RDT, for clinical malaria diagnosis. In febrile patients, only a small proportion of infections are characterized by a parasite density or an HRP2 concentration in the range where use of us-RDT would confer a meaningful advantage over co-RDT.

TI Contribution of Asymptomatic Plasmodium Infections to the Transmission
   of Malaria in Kayin State, Myanmar
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The objective of mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) is to eliminate malaria rapidly by eliminating the asymptomatic malaria parasite reservoirs and interrupting transmission. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, where artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is now widespread, MDA has been proposed as an elimination accelerator, but the contribution of asymptomatic infections to malaria transmission has been questioned. The impact of MDA on entomological indices has not been characterized previously.
   Methods. MDA was conducted in 4 villages in Kayin State (Myanmar). Malaria mosquito vectors were captured 3 months before, during, and 3 months after MDA, and their Plasmodium infections were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The relationship between the entomological inoculation rate, the malaria prevalence in humans determined by ultrasensitive PCR, and MDA was characterized by generalized estimating equation regression.
   Results. Asymptomatic P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections were cleared by MDA. The P. vivax entomological inoculation rate was reduced by 12.5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-100-fold), but the reservoir of asymptomatic P. vivax infections was reconstituted within 3 months, presumably because of relapses. This was coincident with a 5.3-fold (95% CI, 4.8-6.0-fold) increase in the vector infection rate.
   Conclusion. Asymptomatic infections are a major source of malaria transmission in Southeast Asia.

TI Evidence of asymptomatic submicroscopic malaria in low transmission
   areas in Belaga district, Kapit division, Sarawak, Malaysia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaysia has declared its aim to eliminate malaria with a goal of achieving zero local transmission by the year 2020. However, targeting the human reservoir of infection, including those with asymptomatic infection is required toachieve malaria elimination. Diagnosing asymptomatic malaria is not as straightforward due to the obvious lack of clinical manifestations and often subpatent level of parasites. Accurate diagnosis of malaria is important for providing realistic estimates of malaria burden and preventing misinformed interventions. Low levels of parasitaemia acts as silent reservoir of transmission thus remains infectious to susceptible mosquito vectors. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic submicroscopic malaria (SMM) in the District of Belaga, Sarawak.MethodsIn 2013, a total of 1744 dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from residents of 8 longhouses who appeared healthy. Subsequently, 251 venous blood samples were collected from residents of 2 localities in 2014 based on the highest number of submicroscopic cases from prior findings. Thin and thick blood films were prepared from blood obtained from all participants in this study. Microscopic examination were carried out on all samples and a nested and nested multiplex PCR were performed on samples collected in 2013 and 2014 respectively.ResultsNo malaria parasites were detected in all the Giemsa-stained blood films. However, of the 1744 samples, 29 (1.7%) were positive for Plasmodium vivax by PCR. Additionally, of the 251 samples, the most prevalent mono-infection detected by PCR was Plasmodium falciparum 50 (20%), followed by P. vivax 39 (16%), P. knowlesi 9 (4%), and mixed infections 20 (8%).ConclusionsThis research findings conclude evidence of Plasmodium by PCR, among samples previously undetectable by routine blood film microscopic examination, in local ethnic minority who are clinically healthy. SMM in Belaga district is attributed not only to P. vivax, but also to P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. In complementing efforts of programme managers, there is a need to increase surveillance for SMM nationwide to estimate the degree of SMM that warrant measures to block new transmission of malaria.

TI Anopheline species composition and the 1014F-genotype in different
   ecological settings of Burkina Faso in relation to malaria transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundA three-year longitudinal study was conducted in four sentinel sites from different ecological settings in Burkina Faso, between 2008 and 2010 to identify longitudinal changes in insecticide resistance within Anopheles gambiae complex species based on larval collection. During this study, adult mosquitoes were also collected indoor and outdoor using several methods of collection. The present study reports the diversity of malaria vectors and the 1014F-genotype from this adult collection and investigates the association between this 1014F-genotype and sporozoite rate.MethodsAdult mosquitoes were collected from July to August (corresponding to the start of rainy season) and October to November (corresponding to the end of rainy season) over 3years (2008-2010) at four sites across the country, using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), exit traps and pit shelters. Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes were identified to species and genotyped for the L1014F kdr mutation by PCR using genomic DNA. The circumsporozoite antigen of Plasmodium falciparum was detected in mosquitoes using sandwich ELISA.ResultsOverall 9212 anopheline mosquitoes were collected during the study period. Of those, 6767 mosquitoes were identified as Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.). Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae and or Anopheles funestus were incriminated as vectors of P. falciparum in the study area with an average sporozoite rate of 5%, (95% CI 4.14-5.99%). The kdr1014F-genotype frequencies were 11.44% (95% CI 2.5-39.85%), 19.2% (95% CI 4.53-53.73%) and 89.9 (95% CI 63.14-97.45%), respectively for An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The proportion of the 1014F-genotype varied between sporozoite-infected and uninfected An. gambiae s.l. group. There was no significant difference in the 1014F-genotype frequency between infected and uninfected mosquitoes.ConclusionThe current study shows the diversity of malaria vectors and significant interaction between species composition and kdr1014F-genotype in An. gambiae complex mosquitoes from Burkina Faso. In this study, no associations were found between the 1014F-genotype and P. falciparum infection in the major malaria vector An. gambiae s.l.

TI A case of Plasmodium malariae recurrence: recrudescence or reinfection?
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium malariae is the most neglected of the six human malaria species and it is still unknown which is the mechanism underlying the long latency of this Plasmodium.Case presentationA case of PCR-confirmed P. malariae recurrence in a 52-year old Italian man was observed 5months after a primary attack. In the interval between the two observed episodes of malaria the patient denied any further stay in endemic areas except for a visit to Libya, a country considered malaria-free. Genomic DNA of the P. malariae strain using five microsatellites (PM2, PM9, PM11, PM25, PM34) and the antigen marker of circumsporozoite (csp) was amplified and sequenced. Analysis of polymorphisms of the P. malariae csp central repeat region showed differences between the strains responsible of the first and second episode of malaria. A difference in the allele size was also observed for the sequence analysis of PM2 microsatellites.ConclusionsPlasmodium malariae is a challenging human malaria parasite and even with the use of molecular techniques the pathogenesis of recurrent episodes cannot be precisely explained.

TI Malaria Surveillance - United States, 2016
SO MMWR SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES
AB Problem/Condition: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles species mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to provide information on its occurrence (e.g., temporal, geographic, and demographic), guide prevention and treatment recommendations for travelers and patients, and facilitate transmission control measures if locally acquired cases are identified.
   Period Covered: This report summarizes confirmed malaria cases in persons with onset of illness in 2016 and summarizes trends in previous years.
   Description of System: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are reported to local and state health departments by health care providers or laboratory staff members. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consultations. CDC reference laboratories provide diagnostic assistance and conduct antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health departments. This report summarizes data from the integration of all NMSS and NNDSS cases, CDC reference laboratory reports, and CDC clinical consultations.
   Results: CDC received reports of 2,078 confirmed malaria cases with onset of symptoms in 2016, including two congenital cases, three cryptic cases, and one case acquired through blood transfusion. The number of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States has been increasing since the mid-1970s. However, in 2015 a decrease occurred in the number of cases, specifically from the region of West Africa, likely due to altered travel related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak. The number of confirmed malaria cases in 2016 represents a 36% increase compared with 2015, and the 2016 total is 153 more cases than in 2011, which previously had the highest number of cases (1,925 cases). In 2016, a total of 1,729 cases originated from Africa, and 1,061 (61.4%) of these came from West Africa. P. falciparum accounted for the majority of the infections (1,419 [68.2%J), followed by P vivax (251 [12.1%]). Fewer than 2% of patients were infected by two species (23 [1.1%]). The infecting species was not reported or was undetermined in 10.8% of cases. CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 12.1% of confirmed cases and tested 10.8% of specimens with P.falciparum infections for antimalarial resistance markers. Of the U.S. resident patients who reported reason for travel, 69.4% were travelers who were visiting friends and relatives. The proportion of U.S. residents with malaria who reported taking any chemoprophylaxis in 2016 (26.3%) was similar to that in 2015 (26.6%), and adherence was poor among those who took chemoprophylaxis. Among the 964 U.S. residents with malaria for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region were known, 94.0% of patients with malaria did not adhere to or did not take a CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen. Among 795 women with malaria, 50 were pregnant, and one had adhered to mefloquine chemoprophylaxis. Forty-one (2.0%) malaria cases occurred among U.S. military personnel in 2016, a comparable proportion to that in 2015 (23 cases [1.5%]). Among all reported cases in 2016, a total of 306 (14.7%) were classified as severe illnesses, and seven persons died. In 2016, CDC analyzed 144 P.falciparum-positive and nine P.falciparum mixed species samples for surveillance of antimalarial resistance markers (although certain loci were untestable in some samples); genetic polymorphisms associated with resistance to pyrimethamine were identified in 142 (97.9%), to sulfadoxine in 98 (70.5%), to chloroquine in 67 (44.7%), to mefloquine in six (4.3%), and to atovaquone in one (<1.0%). The completeness of key variables (e.g., species, country of acquisition, and resident status) was 79.4% in 2016 and 75.7% in 2015.
   Interpretation: The number of reported malaria cases in 2016 continued a decades-long increasing trend and is the highest since 1972. The importation of malaria reflects the overall increase in global travel trends to and from areas where malaria is endemic; a transient decrease in the acquisition of cases, predominantly from West Africa, occurred in 2015. In 2016, more cases (absolute number) originated from regions of the world with widespread malaria transmission. Since the early 2000s, worldwide interventions to reduce malaria have been successful; however, progress has plateaued in recent years, the disease remains endemic in many regions, and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers remains inadequate.
   Public Health Actions: The best way to prevent malaria is to take chemoprophylaxis medication during travel to a country where malaria is endemic. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In 2018, two tafcnoquine-based antimalarials were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Arakoda was approved for use by adults for chemoprophylaxis and is available as a weekly dosage that is convenient during travel, which might improve adherence and also can prevent relapses from P. vivax and P. ovale infections. Krintafel was approved for radical cure of P. vivax infections in those >16 years old. In April 2019, intravenous artesunate became the first-line medication for treatment of severe malaria in the United States. Because intravenous artesunate is not FDA approved, it is available from CDC under an investigational new drug protocol. Detailed recommendations for preventing malaria are available to the general public at the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html) . Health care providers should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) and from the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713). Persons submitting malaria case reports (care providers, laboratories, and state and local public health officials) should provide complete information because incomplete reporting compromises case investigations and efforts to prevent infections and examine trends in malaria cases. Adherence to recommended malaria prevention strategies is low among U.S. travelers; reasons for nonadherence include prematurely stopping after leaving the area where malaria was endemic, forgetting to take the medication, and experiencing a side effect. Molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) enables CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both domestically and internationally. More samples are needed to improve the completeness of antimalarial drug resistance analysis; therefore, CDC requests that blood specimens be submitted for all cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States.

TI A cluster of the first reported Plasmodium ovale spp. infections in Peru
   occuring among returning UN peace-keepers, a review of epidemiology,
   prevention and diagnostic challenges in nonendemic regions
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri are regarded as less virulent forms of malaria with a geographic distribution including Southeast Asia, Central and West Africa, and is increasingly reported as an infection in returning travellers. A species of malaria that may have delayed or relapsing presentations similar to Plasmodium vivax, the clinical presentation of P. ovale spp. has been described to have prepatent periods of 2weeks or slightly longer with reports of relapse following primary infection out to 8-9months. This presentation may be obscured further in the setting of anti-malarial exposure, with report of delayed primary infection out to 4years. Presented is a cluster of 4 imported P. ovale spp. cases in returning Peruvian military personnel assigned to United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Central African Republic.Case presentationFrom January to December 2016, Peruvian peace-keepers were deployed in support of United Nations (UN) operations in the Central African Republic (CAR). While serving abroad, Navy, Army, and Air Force members experienced 223 episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria following interruption of prophylaxis with mefloquine. Diagnosis was made using rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) and/or smear with no coinfections identified. Cases of malaria were treated with locally-procured artemether-lumefantrine. Returning to Peru in January 2017, 200 peace-keepers were screened via thick and thin smear while on weekly mefloquine prophylaxis with only 1 showing nucleic acid within red blood cells consistent with Plasmodium spp. and 11 reporting syndromes of ill-defined somatic complaints. Between a period of 5days to 11months post return, 4 cases of P. ovale spp. were diagnosed using smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following febrilecomplaints. All cases were subsequently treated with chloroquine and primaquine, with cure of clinical disease and documented clearance of parasitaemia.ConclusionThese patients represent the first imported cases in Peru of this species of malaria as well as highlight thechallenges in implementing population level prophylaxis in a deployed environment, and the steps for timely diagnosis and management in a non-endemic region where risk of introduction for local transmission exists.

TI Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine as treatment for
   Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria in adult patients on
   efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy in Zambia: an open label
   non-randomized interventional trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundHIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) require treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) when infected with malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the most commonly used ACT for treatment of falciparum malaria in Africa but there is limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of AL in HIV-infected individuals on ART, among whom drug-drug interactions are expected. Day-42 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) and incidence of adverse events was assessed in HIV-infected individuals on efavirenz-based ART with uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with AL.MethodsA prospective, open label, non-randomized, interventional clinical trial was conducted at St Paul's Hospital in northern Zambia, involving 152 patients aged 15-65years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, who were on efavirenz-based ART. They received a 3-day directly observed standard treatment of AL and were followed up until day 63. Day-42 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected ACPRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for the intention-to-treat population.ResultsEnrolled patients had a baseline geometric mean (95% CI) parasite density of 1108 (841-1463) parasites/mu L; 16.4% (25/152) of the participants had a recurrent malaria episode by day 42. However, PCR data was available for 17 out of the 25 patients who had malaria recurrence. Among all the 17 patients, PCR findings demonstrated malaria re-infection, making the PCR-adjusted day-42 ACPR 100% in the 144 patients who could be evaluated. Even when eight patients with missing PCR data were considered very conservatively as failures, the day-42 ACPR was over 94%. None of the participants, disease or treatment characteristics, including day-7 lumefantrine concentrations, predicted the risk of malaria recurrence by day 42. AL was well tolerated following administration. There were only two cases of grade 3 neutropaenia and one serious adverse event of lobar pneumonia, none of which was judged as probably related to intake of AL.ConclusionsAL was well tolerated and efficacious in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in HIV co-infected adults on efavirenz-based ART. However, a higher than anticipated proportion of participants experienced malaria re-infection, which highlights the need for additional malaria prevention measures in this sub-population after treatment with AL.Trial registration Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR): PACTR201311000659400.

TI High Plasmodium infection and multiple insecticide resistance in a major
   malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Sahel of Niger Republic
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundInformation on insecticide resistance and the mechanisms driving it in the major malaria vectors is grossly lacking in Niger Republic, thus hindering control efforts. To facilitate evidence-based malaria control, the role of Anopheles coluzzii population from southern Niger, in malaria transmission, its insecticides resistance profile and the molecular mechanisms driving the resistance were characterized.MethodsBlood fed female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato resting indoor were collected at Tessaoua, Niger. Source of blood was established using PCR and infection with Plasmodium determined using TaqMan assay. Resistance profile was established with the major public health insecticides, and resistance intensity determined with deltamethrin. Synergist assays were conducted with piperonyl butoxide and diethyl maleate. Presence of L1014F and L1014S knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was investigated using TaqMan genotyping, and strength of selection pressure acting on the Anopheles populations determined by assessing the genetic diversity of a fragment spanning exon-20 of the VGSC from alive and dead females.ResultsHigh human blood index (96%) and high Plasmodium falciparum infection (13%) was observed in the An. coluzzii population. Also, a single mosquito was found infected with Plasmodium vivax. High pyrethroid and organochloride resistance was observed with mortalities of less than 20% for deltamethrin, permethrin, -cypermethrin, and DDT. A high LD50 (156.65min) was obtained for deltamethrin, with a resistance ratio of47.18 compared to the susceptible Ngoussou colony. Moderate carbamate resistance was observed, and a full susceptibility to organophosphates recorded. Synergist bioassays with piperonyl butoxide and diethyl maleate significantly recovered deltamethrin and DDT susceptibility, respectively implicating CYP450s (mortality=82%, (2)=84.51, p<0.0001) and glutathione S-transferases (mortality=58%, (2)=33.96, p<0.001) in resistance. A high frequency of 1014F kdr mutation (82%) was established, with significant difference in genotype distribution associated with permethrin resistance [odds ratio=7.71 (95% CI 2.43-14.53, (2)=13.67, p=0.001]. Sequencing of intron-1 of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) revealed a low genetic diversity.ConclusionHigh pyrethroid resistance highlight the challenges to the effectiveness of the pyrethroids-based ITNs and indoor residual spraying (IRS) against An. coluzzii in Niger. The pyrethroids-synergists LLINs and organophosphate-based IRS maybe the alternatives for malaria control in southern Niger.

TI K13 propeller domain mutations and pfmdr1 amplification in isolates of
   Plasmodium falciparum collected from Thai-Myanmar border area in
   2006-2010
SO FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA
AB The K13 propeller domain mutation and pfmdr1 amplification have been proposed as useful molecular markers for detection and monitoring of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum Welch, 1897. (Gnomic DNA isolates of P. falciparum was extracted from 235 dried blood spot or whole blood samples collected from patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria residing in areas along the Thai-Myanmar border during 2006-2010. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in K13 propeller domain of P. falciparum at codon 427-709. Pfmdr1 gene copy number was determined by SYBR Green 1 real-time PCR. High prevalence of pfmdr1 multiple copies was observed (42.5% of isolates). The presence of K13 mutations was low (40/235, 17.2%). Seventeen mutations had previously been reported and six mutations were newly detected. The C580Y was found in two isolates (0.9%). The F446I, N458Y and P574L mutations were commonly detected. Seven isolates had both K13 mutation and pfmdr1 multiple copies. It needs to be confirmed whether parasites harbouring both K13 mutation and pfmdr1 multiple copies and/or the observed new mutations of K13 propeller domain are associated with clinical artemisinin resistance.

TI Dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity among asymptomatic
   and symptomatic children in three epidemiological areas in Cote d'Ivoire
SO PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Asymptomatic carriers of Plasmodium are considered a reservoir of the parasite in humans. Therefore, in order to be effective, new malaria elimination strategies must take these targets into account. The aim of this study was to analyse genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum among schoolchildren in three epidemiological areas in Cote d'Ivoire. This was a cross-sectional study carried out from May 2015 to April 2016 in a primary school in rural and urban areas of San Pedro, Grand-Bassam and Abengourou, during the rainy season and the dry season. A total of 282 Plasmodium falciparum isolates were genotyped using Nested PCR of Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 genes. The overall frequency of K1, Mad20 and RO33 alleles was 81.6%, 53.4% and 57% for Pfmsp1 respectively. For Pfmsp2, this frequency was 84.3% and 72.2% for 3D7 and FC27. K1, Mad20 and FC27 Frequencies were significantly higher in Abengourou compared to other sites. Overall, the frequency of MIs was significantly higher in Abengourou for Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2. However, Mad20 and RO33 alleles were significantly higher in the rainy season. No significant difference was observed between Pfmsp2 alleles in both seasons. Frequency of the 3D7 allele was significantly higher in symptomatic patients. MIs and COI increased with parasitemia for Pfmsp1and Pfmsp2. The data can be added to that available for monitoring and control of P. falciparum malaria. Further studies combining the entomological inoculation rate and the genetic diversity of P. falciparum will allow us to shed light on our understanding of the epidemiology of this parasite.

TI Distribution of Duffy Phenotypes among Plasmodium vivax Infections in
   Sudan
SO GENES
AB Negative Duffy expression on the surface of human red blood cells was believed to be a barrier for Plasmodium vivax infection in most Africans. However, P. vivax has been demonstrated to infect Duffy-negative individuals in several Central and East African countries. In this study, we investigated the distribution of Duffy blood group phenotypes with regard to P. vivax infection and parasitemia in Sudan. Out of 992 microscopic-positive malaria samples, 190 were identified as P. vivax positive infections. Among them, 186 were P. vivax mono-infections and 4 were mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections. A subset of 77 samples was estimated with parasitemia by quantitative real-time PCR. Duffy codons were sequenced from the 190 P. vivax positive samples. We found that the Duffy Fy(a-b+) phenotype was the most prevalent, accounting for 67.9% of all P. vivax infections, while homozygous Duffy-negative Fy(a-b-) accounted for 17.9% of the P. vivax infections. The prevalence of infection in Fy(a-b+) and Fy(a+b-)were significantly higher than Fy(a-b-) phenotypes (p = 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). A significantly low proportion of P. vivax infection was observed in Duffy negative individuals Fy(a-b-). This study highlights the prevalence of P. vivax in Duffy-negatives in Sudan and indicates low parasitemia among the Duffy-negative individuals.

TI Genetic changes associated with the temporal shift in invasive
   non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars in Bamako Mali
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) serovars S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are major etiologic agents of invasive bacterial disease among infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Mali. Early studies of iNTS serovars in several countries indicated that S. Typhimurium was more prevalent than S. Enteritidis, including in Mali before 2008. We investigated genomic and associated phenotypic changes associated with an increase in the relative proportion of iNTS caused by S. Enteritidis versus S. Typhimurium in Bamako, Mali, during the period 2002-2012.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Comparative genomics studies identified homologs of tetracycline resistance and arsenic utilization genes that were associated with the temporal shift of serovars causing iNTS shift, along with several hypothetical proteins. These findings, validated through PCR screening and phenotypic assays, provide initial steps towards characterizing the genomic changes consequent to unknown evolutionary pressures associated with the shift in serovar prevalence.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This work identified a shift to S. Enteritidis from the more classic S. Typhimurium, associated with iNTS in Bamako, Mali, during the period 2002-2012. This type of shift in underlying iNTS pathogens are of great importance to pediatric public health in endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, this work demonstrates the utility of combining epidemiologic data, whole genome sequencing, and functional characterization in the laboratory to identify and characterize genomic changes in the isolates that may be involved with the observed shift in circulating iNTS agents.

TI Identification of Alleles in the MSP1 Gene Related to Complicated
   Malaria in Patients Infected with Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast of
   Iran
SO JOURNAL OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE DISEASES
AB Background: To overcome human malaria problem several solutions have been employed including extensive studies in the field of Plasmodia relevant antigens. The aim of this study was to determine allelic variation in the MSP1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum among some falciparum malaria-infected patients in Southeastern Iran.
   Methods: Twenty P. falciparum positive cases were enrolled from Sistan and Baluchistan Province, southeastern Iran in 2013-15. From each case, 1.5ml of peripheral blood was collected into EDTA contained tubes. Thick and thin blood smears were stained with standard Giemsa stain and were checked with conventional microscopical method. DNA was extracted from blood samples and amplification of block 2 MSP1 was performed using specific primers. Gel electrophoresis was done and results showed some amplification fragments corresponding to block 2 regions of Pf MSP1 gene. Finally, four samples from different allelic types were sent for sequencing process.
   Results: Fragments were different in size, so classified into six allelic types as kinds of 1-6 based on happening frequencies. Digestion of PCR products revealed two sub allelic types (A and B) within allelic types 2 and 3, but not in allelic types 1, 4, 5 and 6. Twenty percent of samples were sent for sequencing. Sequence alignment showed 78.95% to 91.83% identity between samples.
   Conclusion: Identity between samples and phylogenetic tree revealed that there is an extensive diversity range among isolates. Fifty percent of the isolates were under the risk of complicated malaria. Two of these patients (10%) needed special care and recovery was obtained after getting hospital services.

TI Malaria Prevalence in a Low Transmission Area, Jazan District of
   Southwestern Saudi Arabia
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Detailed description of malaria in low transmission areas is crucial for elimination. The current study aimed to provide a comprehensive description for malaria transmission in Jazan, a low transmission district, southwestern Saudi Arabia. Patients at a tertiary care hospital were recruited in our study between August 2016 and September 2018. Malaria diagnosis was performed through a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR), microscopy and Paramax-3 (TM) rapid detection test (RDT). Malaria was detected in 30 patients by the PCR, with point prevalence of 10.9%. Of these malaria infections, 80% was imported, 26.6% was asymptomatic and 23.3% was sub-microscopic. Malaria was reported throughout the year, with February/March and September/October peaks. Infection was significantly more in males than in females (P = 0.01). Likewise, infections were detected more in febrile than in non-febrile patients (P = 0.01). Adult aged 15-24 years, fever and travel were identified as high-risk factors. Malaria was primarily attributed to Plasmodium falciparum mono-infections, followed by P. vivax mono-infections and lastly to falciparum/vivax mixed infections accounting 76.6%, 16.6%, and 6.6% of PCR-confirmed malaria cases, respectively. The nested PCR was superior to the smear microscopy (sensitivity 76.6%; specificity 100%) and the RDT (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 94.2%). The overall percent agreement between microscopy and the RDT was 92.7% (kappa = 0.63). High proportion of imported malaria including sub-microscopic and sub-patent cases were described. We suggest that incorporation of molecular tool into the conventional malaria diagnosis is beneficial in Jazan district.

TI Serological evidence for a decline in malaria transmission following
   major scale-up of control efforts in a setting selected for Plasmodium
   vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria elimination in Babile district,
   Oromia, Ethiopia
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background Following successful malaria control during the last decade, Ethiopia instituted a stepwise malaria elimination strategy in selected low-transmission areas.
   Methods Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Babile district, Oromia, Ethiopia from July to November 2017 to evaluate malaria infection status using microscopy and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and serological markers of exposure targeting Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1).
   Results Parasite prevalence was 1.2% (14/1135) and 5.1% (58/1143) for P. falciparum and 0.4% (5/1135) and 3.6% (41/1143) for P. vivax by microscopy and nPCR, respectively. Antibody prevalence was associated with current infection by nPCR for both P. falciparum (p<0.001) and P. vivax (p=0.014) and showed an age-dependent increase (p<0.001, for both species). Seroconversion curves indicated a decline in malaria exposure 15 y prior to sampling for P. falciparum and 11.5 y prior to sampling for P. vivax, broadly following malaria incidence data from district health offices, with higher antibody titres in adults than children for both species.
   Conclusions Malaria transmission declined substantially in the region with continuing heterogeneous but measurable local transmission, arguing in favour of continued and tailored control efforts to accelerate the progress towards elimination efforts.

TI Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine versus
   dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated
   malaria among children in Rwanda: an open-label, randomized controlled
   trial
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have proven highly effective in reducing malaria morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was introduced in 2005 as a first-line ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Rwanda. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of ACTs is necessary to ensure effective malaria case management.
   Methods A comparative study on the efficacy of AL and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) was conducted in two sites, Masaka and Ruhuha, between September 2013 and December 2015. Clinical and parasitological responses were assessed at days 28 and 42.
   Results A total of 534 children were treated with AL (n=267) or DHP (n=267). After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) adjustment, 98.3% and 98.9% of children in the AL and DHP arms, respectively, achieved an adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28. At day 42, PCR-adjusted ACPR proportions were 97.3% and 98.4% for AL and DHP, respectively. PCR-adjusted ACPR was 99% for both drugs at days 28 and 42 in Ruhuha. The PCR-adjusted ACPR proportions in Masaka were 97.3% for AL and 98.5% for DHP at day 28 and 95.2% for AL and 97.5% for DHP at day 42.
   Conclusions AL remains efficacious in Rwanda 10 y after its adoption. The probability of new infections occurring among patients in the DHP arm was significantly lower than those in the AL arm. DHP also demonstrated a greater post-treatment prophylactic effect against new infections compared with AL.

TI An improved nucleic acid extraction method from dried blood spots for
   amplification of Plasmodium falciparum kelch13 for detection of
   artemisinin resistance
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMutational analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene is routinely performed to track the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance. Surveillance of resistance markers has been impeded by the difficulty of extracting sufficient DNA from low parasite density infections common in low-transmission settings, such as Southeast Asia. This problem can be overcome by collecting large volumes of venous blood. Efficient methods for extracting and amplifying k13 from dried blood spots (DBS) would facilitate resistance surveillance.MethodsMethods for k13 amplification from standard Whatman 3MM DBS (stored for 14days at 28 degrees C with 80% relative humidity) were optimized by systematically testing different extraction conditions. Conditions that improved parasite DNA recovery as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 18S rDNA were then tested for their impact on k13 PCR amplification.ResultsThe optimized protocol for amplification of k13 from DBS is markedly more sensitive than standard methods using commercial kits. Using this method, k13 was successfully amplified from laboratory-created DBS samples with parasite densities as low as 500parasites/mL. Importantly, the method recovers both DNA and RNA, making it compatible with RNA-based ultrasensitive techniques currently in use.ConclusionsThe optimized DBS protocol should facilitate drug resistance surveillance, especially in low-transmission settings where clinical malaria infections with high parasite densities are rare.

The sixth round of surveillance was conducted between 2015 and 2017 to determine the therapeutic efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 10 sentinel sites across the country.MethodsThe study was a one-arm, prospective, evaluation of the clinical, parasitological, and haematological responses to directly observed treatment with AS-AQ and AL among children 6months to 9years old with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The WHO 2009 protocol on surveillance of anti-malaria drug efficacy was used for the study with primary outcomes as prevalence of day 3 parasitaemia and clinical and parasitological cure rates on day 28. Secondary outcomes assessed included patterns of fever and parasite clearance as well as changes in haemoglobin concentration.ResultsDay 3 parasitaemia was absent in all sites following treatment with AS-AQ whilst only one person (0.2%) was parasitaemic on day 3 following treatment with AL. Day 28 PCR-corrected cure rates following treatment with AS-AQ ranged between 96.7% (95% CI 88.5-99.6) and 100%, yielding a national rate of 99.2% (95% CI 97.7-99.7). Day 28 PCR-corrected cure rates following treatment with AL ranged between 91.3% (95% CI 79.2-97.6) and 100%, yielding a national rate of 96% (95% CI 93.5-97.6). Prevalence of fever declined by 88.4 and 80.4% after first day of treatment with AS-AQ and AL, respectively, whilst prevalence of parasitaemia on day 2 was 2.1% for AS-AQ and 1.5% for AL. Gametocytaemia was maintained at low levels (<5%) during the 3days of treatment. Post-treatment mean haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher than pre-treatment concentration following treatment with either AS-AQ or AL.ConclusionsThe therapeutic efficacy of AS-AQ and AL is over 90% in sentinel sites across Ghana. The two anti-malarial drugs therefore remain efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the country and continue to achieve rapid fever and parasite clearance as well as low gametocyte carriage rates and improved post-treatment mean haemoglobin concentration.

TI Safety and tolerability of single low-dose primaquine in a low-intensity
   transmission area in South Africa: an open-label, randomized controlled
   trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundTo reduce onward falciparum malaria transmission, the World Health Organization recommends adding single low-dose (SLD)primaquine to artemisinin-based combination treatment in low transmission areas. However, uptake of this recommendation has been relatively slow given concerns about whether individual risks justify potential community benefit. This study was undertaken to generate comprehensive local data on the risk-benefit profile of SLD primaquine deployment in a pre-elimination area in South Africa.MethodsThis randomized, controlled open-label trial investigated adding a single low primaquine dose on day 3 to standard artemether-lumefantrine treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Efficacy, safety and tolerability of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine treatment were assessed on days 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42. Lumefantrine concentrations were assayed from dried blood spot samples collected on day 7.ResultsOf 217 patients screened, 166 were enrolled with 140 randomized on day 3, 70 to each study arm (primaquine and no primaquine). No gametocytes were detected by either microscopy or PCR in any of the follow-up samples collected after randomizationon day 3, precluding assessment of primaquine efficacy. Prevalence of the CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*17 mutant alleles was low with allelic frequencies of 0.02, 0.11 and 0.16, respectively; none had the CYP2D6*4/*4 variant associated with null activity. Among 172 RDT-positive patients G6PD-genotyped, 24 (14%) carried the G6PD deficient (A-) variant. Median haemoglobin concentrations were similar between treatment arms throughout follow-up. A third of participants had a haemoglobin drop >2g/dL; this was not associated with primaquine treatment but may be associated with G6PD genotype [52.9% (9/17) with A- genotype vs. 31% (36/116) with other genotypes (p=0.075)]. Day 7 lumefantrine concentrations and the number and nature of adverse events were similar between study arms; only one serious adverse event occurred (renal impairment in the no primaquine arm). The artemether-lumefantrine PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response rate was 100%, with only one re-infection found among the 128 patientswho completed 42-day follow-up.ConclusionsSafety, tolerability, CYP2D6 and G6PD variant data from this study support the deployment of the WHO-recommended SLD primaquine without G6PD testing to advance malaria elimination in South African districts with low-intensity residual transmission.Trial registration Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201611001859416.

TI Genetic diversity and drug resistance surveillance of Plasmodium
   falciparum for malaria elimination: is there an ideal tool for
   resource-limited sub-Saharan Africa?
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB The intensification of malaria control interventions has resulted in its global decline, but it remains a significant public health burden especially in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Knowledge on the parasite diversity, its transmission dynamics, mechanisms of adaptation to environmental and interventional pressures could help refine or develop new control and elimination strategies. Critical to this is the accurate assessment of the parasite's genetic diversity and monitoring of genetic markers of anti-malarial resistance across all susceptible populations. Such wide molecular surveillance will require selected tools and approaches from a variety of ever evolving advancements in technology and the changing epidemiology of malaria. The choice of an effective approach for specific endemic settings remains challenging, particularly for countries in sSA with limited access to advanced technologies. This article examines the current strategies and tools for Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity typing and resistance monitoring and proposes how the different tools could be employed in resource-poor settings. Advanced approaches enabling targeted deep sequencing is valued as a sensitive method for assessing drug resistance and parasite diversity but remains out of the reach of most laboratories in sSA due to the high cost of development and maintenance. It is, however, feasible to equip a limited number of laboratories as Centres of Excellence in Africa (CEA), which will receive and process samples from a network of peripheral laboratories in the continent. Cheaper, sensitive and portable real-time PCR methods can be used in peripheral laboratories to pre-screen and select samples for targeted deep sequence or genome wide analyses at these CEAs.

TI Asymptomatic malaria infections and Pfmdr1 mutations in an endemic area
   of Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria eradication globally is yet to be achieved and transmission is sustained in many endemic countries. Plasmodium falciparum continues to develop resistance to currently available anti-malarial drugs, posing great problems for malaria elimination. This study evaluates the frequencies of asymptomatic infection and multidrug resistance-1 (mdr-1) gene mutations in parasite isolates, which form the basis for understanding persistently high incidence in South West, Nigeria.MethodsA total of 535 individuals aged from 6months were screened during the epidemiological survey evaluating asymptomatic transmission. Parasite prevalence was determined by histidine-rich protein II rapid detection kit (RDT) in healthy individuals. Plasmodium falciparum mdr-1 gene mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digest and electrophoresis to determine polymorphism in parasite isolates. Sequencing was done to confirm polymorphism. Proportions were compared using Chi-square test at p value<0.05.ResultsMalaria parasites were detected by RDT in 204 (38.1%) individuals. Asymptomatic infection was detected in 117 (57.3%) and symptomatic malaria confirmed in 87 individuals (42.6%). Overall, individuals with detectable malaria by RDT was significantly higher in individuals with symptoms, 87 of 197 (44.2%), than asymptomatic persons; 117 of 338 (34.6%), p=0.02. In a sub-set of 75 isolates, 18(24%) and 14 (18.6%) individuals had Pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y mutations.ConclusionsThere is still high malaria transmission rate in Nigeria with higher incidence of asymptomatic infections. These parasites harbour mutations on Pfmdr1 which contribute to artemisinin partner drug resistance; surveillance strategies to reduce the spread of drug resistance in endemic areas are needed to eliminate the reservoir of malaria parasites that can mitigate the eradication of malaria in Nigeria.

TI High-Complexity Plasmodium falciparum Infections, North Central Nigeria,
   2015-2018
SO EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB The mass migration that occurred during 2009-2013 and after the insurgency in northeastern Nigeria could have increased malaria incidence and Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity in North Central Nigeria. To determine P. falciparum sequence diversity in this region, we screened 282 samples collected in regional clinics during 2015-2018 for Plasmodium spp. and, with positive samples, determined P. falciparum infection complexity and allele diversity using PCR. Of 34 P. falciparum-positive samples, 39 msp1, 31 msp2, and 13 glurp alleles were detected, and 88% of infections were polyclonal. We identified trimorphic and dimorphic allele combinations in a high percentage of samples, indicative of a high infection complexity in the study population. High genetic diversity is a catalyst for the evolution of drug resistant-alleles. Improved measures (e.g., better drug quality, diagnostics) are needed to control P. falciparum transmission and reduce the potential for the emergence of drug resistance in Nigeria.

TI Plasmodium falciparum K13 expression associated with parasite clearance
   during artemisinin-based combination therapy
SO JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Background Delayed parasite clearance and, consequently, reduced efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies have been linked with Plasmodium falciparum K13 gene SNPs in Southeast Asia. In Africa, significantly prolonged clearance has not yet been observed and the presently restricted variation in parasite clearance cannot be explained by K13 polymorphisms.
   Objectives Our aim was to study the in vivo pfK13 transcriptional response in patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine and explore whether the pfk13 transcripts can explain the patients' parasite clearance outcomes.
   Patients and methods A total of 47 Tanzanian children with microscopically confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were hospitalized and received artemether-lumefantrine treatment (clinical trial ID: NCT00336375). RNA was extracted from venous blood samples collected before treatment initiation and at five more timepoints after treatment. cDNA was synthesized and pfk13 transcripts measured by real-time PCR.
   Results A wide range of pfk13 transcript variation was observed throughout all timepoints after artemether-lumefantrine treatment. Taking parasite clearance data together with the pfk13 transcripts profile, we observed a negative correlation inferring that pfk13 down-regulation is associated with longer parasite clearance time.
   Conclusions The findings suggest that a reduced PfK13 transcriptional response may represent a first step towards artemisinin tolerance/resistance.

TI Genetic diversity and allelic variation in MSP3 alpha gene of paired
   clinical Plasmodium vivax isolates from Delhi, India
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax malaria accounts for 80% of the malaria cases in Delhi, India. The gene merozoite surface protein 3 alpha (MSP3 alpha) is highly polymorphic and has been used as marker in many P. vivax population studies.
   Methods: MSP3 alpha has been used to assess the genetic diversity ofP. vivax samples from Delhi (India) having more than one malaria episode (s) i.e. clinically identified relapse cases using PCR-RFLP and sequencing.
   Results: Three major genotypes 2.0 kb (A), 1.4 kb (B) and 1.2 kb (C) were amplified from 72 isolates with frequencies of 72.2%, 19.44% and 9.72% respectively. One sample out of 72 showed mixed infection having both A and B type genotypes. 82.05% patients showed same genotype while only 17.94% patients showed different genotypes after subsequent malaria episodes. 18 different genotypes with Alu I and 35 with Hha I were identified among 72 samples analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). 18 Pvmsp3 alpha nucleotide sequences were analyzed and it did not reveal any distinct intragenic differences within sequences of the same type, however, allelic diversity among the three types (Pi = 0.029703) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis showed allelic family types A, B and C were not clustered but distributed in different branches. The results indicate that the P. vivax parasite population is highly diverse in Delhi, India. A large number of amino acid substitutions were found at the locus of the isolates when compared with the Belem Strain (Pi = 0.030528). The substantial sequence diversity is largely restricted to certain domains of encoded protein. Analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions suggested that different selection forces were operating on different regions of the protein molecule.
   Conclusion: We propose that genotyping of the PvMSP-3 alpha gene as one of the molecular tools for differentiating relapse from new infection in epidemiological settings. The analyses of sequence polymorphism in PvMSP-3 alpha gene enable it as potential candidate for inclusion in a P.vivax vaccine research. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Detection of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Markers of Antimalarial Drug
   Resistance Directly from Whole Blood
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Monitoring of antimalarial resistance is important to prevent its further spread, but the available options for assessing resistance are less than ideal for field settings. Although molecular detection is perhaps the most efficient method, it is also the most complex because it requires DNA extraction and PCR instrumentation. To develop a more deployable approach, we designed new probes, which, when used in combination with an inhibitor-tolerant Taq polymerase, enable single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping directly from whole blood. The probes feature two strategic design elements: locked nucleic acids to enhance specificity and the reporter dyes Cy5 and TEX615, which have less optical overlap with the blood absorbance spectra than other commonly used dyes. Probe performance was validated on a traditional Laboratory-based instrument and then further tested on a field-deployable Adaptive PCR instrument to develop a point-of-care platform appropriate for use in malaria settings. The probes discriminated between wild-type Plasmodium falciparum and the chloroquine-resistant CRT PF3D7_0709000:c.227A>C (p.Lys76Thr) mutant in the presence of 2% blood. Additionally, in allelic discrimination plots with the new probes, samples clustered more closely to their respective axes compared with samples using minor groove binder probes with 6-FAM and VIC reporter dyes. Our strategy greatly simplifies single-nucleotide polymorphism detection and provides a more accessible alternative for antimalarial resistance surveillance in the field.

TI Contrasting Asymptomatic and Drug Resistance Gene Prevalence of
   Plasmodium falciparum in Ghana: Implications on Seasonal Malaria
   Chemoprevention
SO GENES
AB Malaria is a significant public health problem in Ghana. Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) using a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine has been implemented since 2015 in northern Ghana where malaria transmission is intense and seasonal. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers in three ecological zones of Ghana, and compared the sensitivity and specificity of different molecular methods in identifying asymptomatic infections. Moreover, we examined the frequency of mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps that relate to the ongoing SMC. A total of 535 asymptomatic schoolchildren were screened by microscopy and PCR (18s rRNA and TARE-2) methods. Among all samples, 28.6% were detected as positive by 18S nested PCR, whereas 19.6% were detected by microscopy. A high PCR-based asymptomatic prevalence was observed in the north (51%) compared to in the central (27.8%) and south (16.9%). The prevalence of pfdhfr-N51I/C59R/S108N/pfdhps-A437G quadruple mutant associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance was significantly higher in the north where SMC was implemented. Compared to 18S rRNA, TARE-2 serves as a more sensitive molecular marker for detecting submicroscopic asymptomatic infections in high and low transmission settings. These findings establish a baseline for monitoring P. falciparum prevalence and resistance in response to SMC over time.

TI Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale infections and their
   association with common red blood cell polymorphisms in a highly endemic
   area of Uganda
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae infections are scarcely studied in sub-Saharan Africa, where the Plasmodium falciparum species predominates. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of P. ovale and P. malariae infections and their relationship with common red blood cell polymorphisms in a cohort of 509 individuals from Uganda.
   Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in individuals of 1-10 and >20 y of age from the Apac district at baseline and 6 and 16 weeks after drug treatment. Malaria infections were assessed by polymerase chain reaction and genotyping was performed for the sickle-cell allele, alpha-thalassaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
   Results: At baseline, the prevalence of infection was 7.5%, 12.6% and 57.4% for P. ovale, P. malariae and P. falciparum species, respectively. Co-infections were present in 14.1% of individuals, all including P. falciparum parasites. In children 1-5 y of age, the prevalence of P. ovale mono-infections increased significantly from 1.7% to 7.3% over time (p=0.004) while the prevalence of P. malariae and P. falciparum infections declined significantly during this study. After adjusting for confounding and multiple testing, only alpha-thalassaemia had a statistically significant increase in the odds of P. falciparum infections (odds ratio 1.93 [95% confidence interval 1.26 to 2.94]).
   Conclusions: Common red blood cell polymorphisms do not show strong effects on mild Plasmodium infections in this Ugandan population. To understand the extent of this result, similar studies should be carried out in other populations using larger cohorts.

TI Absence of K13 gene mutations among artesunate/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
   treatment failures of Sudanese Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
   Damazin, southeast Sudan
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: The emergence of resistant parasites to artemisinin poses a threat to malaria treatment. The study aimed to investigate K13 gene mutations in Plasmodium falciparum artesunate (AS)/sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (SP) efficacy study in Sudan.
   Methods: A total of 31 (14 failures and 17 adequate clinical and parasitological response [ACPR]) pretreatment dried blood samples from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treated with AS/SP were examined. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing of the K13 gene was performed.
   Results: PCR products were obtained from 30 (96.8%) samples and sequencing was successful in 28 (90.3%). No mutation of the K13 gene was recorded in the treatment failure group. A single mutation (C>T; A621V) in one ACPR patient sample was detected.
   Conclusion: There is no evidence of K13 mutation among AS/SP treatment failure patients. A single mutation of the K13 gene not linked to treatment failure has been detected.

TI Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
SO OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Malaria transmission through blood transfusion is an accidental but preventable cause of malaria infection and is increasingly becoming a matter of concern for blood transfusion services. This systematic review was conducted to provide a summary of evidence about the prevalence of Plasmodium infection in asymptomatic blood donors and the effectiveness of screening methods used based on the available literature.
   Methods. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and EMBASE were searched from 1982 to October 10, 2017. All peer-reviewed original research articles describing the prevalence of malaria parasitemia in blood donors with different diagnostic methods were included. The random-effects model was applied to assess the effects of heterogeneity among the selected studies. Incoherence and heterogeneity between studies were quantified by I-2 index and Cochran's Q test. Publication and population bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's regression asymmetry test. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata (version 2.7.2).
   Results. Seventy-one studies from 21 countries, 5 continents, were included in the present systematic review. The median prevalence of malaria parasitemia among 984 975 asymptomatic healthy blood donors was 10.54%, 5.36%, and 0.38% by microscopy, molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction), and rapid diagnostic tests, respectively. The most commonly detected Plasmodium species was P. falciparum.
   Conclusions. This systematic review demonstrates that compared with other transfusion-linked infections, that is, HIV, HCV, and HBV, transfusion-transmitted malaria is one of the most significant transfusion-associated infections especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Future work must aim to understand the clinical significance of transfusion-transmitted malaria in malaria-endemic settings.

TI Optimal Duration of Follow-up for Assessing Antimalarial Efficacy in
   Pregnancy: A Retrospective Analysis of a Cohort Followed Up Until
   Delivery on the Thailand-Myanmar Border
SO OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Follow-up for 28-42 days is recommended by the World Health Organization to assess antimalarial drug efficacy for nonpregnant populations. This study aimed to determine the optimal duration for pregnant women, as no specific guidance currently exists.
   Methods. The distributions of time to recrudescence (treatment failure), confirmed by polymerase chain reaction genotyping for different antimalarial drugs in pregnancy, were analyzed by accelerated failure time models using secondary data on microscopically confirmed recurrent falciparum malaria collected in prospective studies on the Thailand-Myanmar border between 1994 and 2010.
   Results. Of 946 paired isolates from 703 women, the median duration of follow-up for each genotyped recurrence (interquartile range) was 129 (83-174) days, with 429 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed recrudescent. Five different treatments were evaluated, and 382 Plasmodium falciparum recrudescences were identified as eligible. With log-logistic models adjusted for baseline parasitemia, the predicted cumulative proportions of all the recrudescences that were detected by 28 days were 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65%-74%) for quinine monotherapy (n = 295), 66% (95% CI, 53%-76%) for artesunate monotherapy (n = 43), 62% (95% CI, 42%-79%) for artemether-lumefantrine (AL; n = 19), 46% (95% CI, 26%-67%) for artesunate with clindamycin (n = 19), and 34% (95% CI, 11%-67%) for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP; n = 6). Corresponding figures by day 42 were 89% (95% CI, 77%-95%) for AL and 71% (95% CI, 38%-91%) for DP. Follow-up for 63 days was predicted to detect = 95% of all recrudescence, except for DP.
   Conclusions. In low-transmission settings, antimalarial drug efficacy assessments in pregnancy require longer follow-up than for nonpregnant populations.

TI False-negative malaria rapid diagnostic test results and their impact on
   community-based malaria surveys in sub-Saharan Africa
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Surveillance and diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria relies predominantly on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). However, false-negative (FN) RDT results are known to occur for a variety of reasons, including operator error, poor storage conditions, pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, poor performance of specific RDT brands and lots, and low-parasite density infections. We used RDT and microscopy results from 85 000 children enrolled in Demographic Health Surveys and Malaria Indicator Surveys from 2009 to 2015 across 19 countries to explore the distribution of and risk factors for FN-RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria's impact is greatest. We sought to (1) identify spatial and demographic patterns of FN-RDT results, defined as a negative RDT but positive gold standard microscopy test, and (2) estimate the percentage of infections missed within community-based malaria surveys due to FN-RDT results. Across all studies, 19.9% (95% CI 19.0% to 20.9%) of microscopy-positive subjects were negative by RDT. The distribution of FN-RDT results was spatially heterogeneous. The variance in FN-RDT results was best explained by the prevalence of malaria, with an increase in FN-RDT results observed at lower transmission intensities, among younger subjects, and in urban areas. The observed proportion of FN-RDT results was not predicted by differences in RDT brand or lot performance alone. These findings characterise how the probability of detection by RDTs varies in different transmission settings and emphasise the need for careful interpretation of prevalence estimates based on surveys employing RDTs alone. Further studies are needed to characterise the cost-effectiveness of improved malaria diagnostics (eg, PCR or highly sensitive RDTs) in community-based surveys, especially in regions of low transmission intensity or high urbanicity.

TI Molecular Monitoring of Plasmodium falciparum Resistance to
   Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Western Kenya, 14 Years after its
   Withdrawal
SO ANNALS OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES RESEARCH
AB Background: The application of chloroquine (CQ) as an antimalarial drug for over half a century and subsequent development of CQ-resistant Plasmodium strains has led to its withdrawal and replacement with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). In 2004, SP was replaced with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a first-line against uncomplicated malaria in Kenya with SP being recommended for intermittent preventive in pregnancy (IPTp). Several mutations of Plasmodium falciparum have been implicated in SP resistance but it is unclear if the prevalence of these mutations is decreasing or increasing after it was restricted to expectant mothers. This study was design to assess the current status pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutation which encodes enzymes targeting SP. Method: Blood from a finger prick was collected onto a filter paper from P. falciparum positive children attending health facility in Chulaimbo between May and November 2015. Using chelex-100 extraction DNA, genotyping was done for mutations on codon 51, 59 and 108 of pfdhr and 437 and 540 of pfdhps genes using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Results: All the 76 P. falciparum isolates were successfully genotyped for the detection of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutations associated with SP resistance. The P. falciparum isolates were found to carry the mutant type N51I with a prevalence of 94% while C59R and S108N had 92% each. The prevalence of mutation at Pfdhps codons A437G and K540E stood at 94% and 91% respectively. Conclusion: The present study observed that there is no statistical significant on codon 51I and 437G (chi(2) = 3.3099 df=1 p>0.05) change in the proportion of resistant genotypes. However, there was a statistical significant on codon 59R and 108N (chi(2) = 4.338 df=1 p<0.05) and 540E (chi(2) = 5.391 df=1 p<0.05) indicating a slow but steady decreased resistance despite its withdrawal. In addition, the evidence of quintuple mutations in the study population is threatening the future of SP especially in intermittent preventive treatment prophylaxis (IPTp) programs and also future combination with another antimalarial drug. These findings highlight the need for continual monitoring of parasites genotypes as indicators of therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial.

TI Characterization of Plasmodium infections among inhabitants of rural
   areas in Gabon
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Plasmodium infections in endemic areas are often asymptomatic, can be caused by different species and contribute significantly to transmission. We performed a cross-sectional study in February/March 2016 including 840 individuals >= 1 year living in rural Gabon (Ngounie and Moyen-Ogooue). Plasmodium parasitemia was measured by high-sensitive, real-time quantitative PCR. In a randomly chosen subset of P. falciparum infections, gametocyte carriage and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant genotypes were analysed. 618/834 (74%) individuals were positive for Plasmodium 18S-rRNA gene amplification, of these 553 (66.3%) carried P. falciparum, 193 (23%) P. malariae, 74 (8.9%) P. ovate curtisi and 38 (4.6%) P.ovale wallikeri. Non-falciparum infections mostly presented as mixed infections. P. malariae monoinfected individuals were significantly older (median age: 60 years) than coinfected (20 years) or P. falciparum monoinfected individuals (23 years). P. falciparum gametocyte carriage was confirmed in 109/223 (48.9%) individuals, prevalence of chloroquine-resistant genotypes was high (298/336, 89%), including four infections with a new SVMNK genotype. In rural Gabon, Plasmodium infections with all endemic species are frequent, emphasizing that malaria control efforts shall cover asymptomatic infections also including non-falciparum infections when aiming for eradication.

TI Assessment of malaria real-time PCR methods and with focus on low-level
   parasitaemia
SO PLOS ONE
AB In epidemiological surveys and surveillance the application of molecular tools is essential in detecting submicroscopic malaria. A genus-specific conventional cytochrome b (cytb) PCR has shown high sensitivity in field studies, detecting 70% submicroscopic malaria. The main objective of this study was to assess the conversion from conventional to real-time PCR testing both SYBR and probe protocols, and including quantitative (q) PCR. The protocols were assessed applying well-defined clinical patient material consisting of 33 positive and 80 negative samples. Sequencing of positive PCR products was performed. In addition, a sensitivity comparison of real-time PCR methods was done by including five relevant assays investigating the effect of amplification target and platform. Sensitivity was further examined using field material consisting of 111 P. falciparum positive samples from Tanzanian children (< 5 years), as well as using related patient data to assess the application of q-PCR with focus on low-level parasitaemia. Both the cytb SYBR and probe PCR protocols showed as high sensitivity and specificity as their conventional counterpart, except missing one P. malariae sample. The SYBR protocol was more sensitive and specific than using probe. Overall, choice of amplification target applied is relevant for achieving ultra-sensitivity, and using intercalating fluorescence dye rather than labelled hydrolysis probes is favourable. Application of q-PCR analysis in field projects is important for the awareness and understanding of low-level parasitaemia. For use in clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies the highly sensitive and user-friendly cytb SYBR q-PCR method is a relevant tool. The genus-specific method has the advantage that species identification by sequencing can be performed as an alternative to species-specific PCR.

TI Severe oxidative stress in sickle cell disease patients with
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kampala, Uganda
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB BackgroundOxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of both Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, there are limited studies on the effect of P. falciparum malaria infection on oxidative stress in SCD patients.MethodsA cross-sectional study was undertaken to compare levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress in isolates from SCD patients with uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria. The biomarkers namely: malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were determined in plasma samples from SCD malaria positive, malaria positive, SCD malaria negative and healthy control participants. The genetic diversity of P.falciparum was determined by nested polymerase chain reaction of merozoite surface protein-2 (MSP-2) gene.ResultsOut of 207 participants, 54 (26%) were SCD malaria positive, 51 (24%) malaria positive, 51 (24%) SCD controls and 51 (24%) healthy control individuals. The mean concentration of MDA was significantly higher in SCD malaria positive than SCD controls (P<0.0001). In contrast, the mean concentration of GSH (P<0.0001) and GPx (P<0.0001) were significantly lower in SCD malaria than SCD controls. Although not significantly different, the mean concentration of MDA was higher (P=0.0478), but the geometric mean parasite density (P=0.2430) and multiplicity of infection (P=0.3478) were lower in SCD malaria samples than in malaria samples. The most prevalent MSP2 allelic family was IC3D7 in SCD malaria (72%) and Malaria (76%) samples. The biomarkers of oxidative stress were not significantly different between IC3D7 and FC27 allelic families of MSP2.ConclusionWe identified severe oxidative stress in Sickle cell disease patients with uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria.

TI Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection in Neotropical
   primates in the western Amazon, Brazil
SO ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The Brazilian Amazon is endemic for malaria and natural infections by Plasmodium spp. have been detected in Neotropical primates. Despite the diversity of primate species in the region, studies on infections by these agents are limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of infection by Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum in free-born primates that were kept in captivity, in the western Amazon, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 98 Neotropical primates. Detection of P. vivax and P. falciparum DNA was performed using a semi-nested PCR, and the amplified products were sequenced. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected in 6.12% (6/98) of the primates. P. vivax, and P. falciparum DNA was detected in 2.04% (2/98) and 4.08% (4/98) of these mammals, respectively. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the results obtained from the semi-nested PCR. The presence of infected non-human primates (NHP) can be auxiliary in the maintenance of P. falciparum and P. vivax and may have implications for the malaria surveillance and control in the Brazilian Amazon. It is necessary to structure an efficient surveillance system for the aetiological agents of malaria that infect NHP and humans to reduce the risk of Plasmodium spp. introduction into new areas, to protect all susceptible species.

TI Anopheles bionomics, insecticide resistance mechanisms, and malaria
   transmission in the Korhogo area, northern Cote d'Ivoire: a
   pre-intervention study
SO PARASITE
AB A better understanding of malaria transmission at a local scale is essential for developing and implementing effective control strategies. In the framework of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to provide an updated description of malaria transmission in the Korhogo area, northern Cote d'Ivoire, and to obtain baseline data for the trial. We performed human landing collections (HLCs) in 26 villages in the Korhogo area during the rainy season (September-October 2016, April-May 2017) and the dry season (November-December 2016, February-March 2017). We used PCR techniques to ascertain the species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection, and insecticide resistance mechanisms in a subset of Anopheles vectors. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was the predominant malaria vector in the Korhogo area. Overall, more vectors were collected outdoors than indoors (p < 0.001). Of the 774 An. gambiae s.l. tested in the laboratory, 89.65% were An. gambiae s.s. and 10.35% were An. coluzzii. The frequencies of the kdr allele were very high in An. gambiae s.s. but the ace-1 allele was found at moderate frequencies. An unprotected individual living in the Korhogo area received an average of 9.04, 0.63, 0.06 and 0.12 infected bites per night in September-October, November-December, February-March, and April-May, respectively. These results demonstrate that the intensity of malaria transmission is extremely high in the Korhogo area, especially during the rainy season. Malaria control in highly endemic areas such as Korhogo needs to be strengthened with complementary tools in order to reduce the burden of the disease.

Previous studies have shown reduced clearance of quinine, a treatment for Plasmodium infection, in individuals with malaria.MethodsThe hepatic expression of a large panel of drug metabolizing enzymes was studied in the livers of mice infected with the AS strain of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, a nonlethal parasite in most strains of mice with several features that model human Plasmodium infections. C57BL/6J mice were infected with P. chabaudi by intraperitoneal injection of infected erythrocytes and sacrificed at different times after infection. Relative hepatic mRNA levels of various drug metabolizing enzymes, cytokines and acute phase proteins were measured by reverse transcriptase-real time PCR. Relative levels of cytochrome P450 proteins were measured by Western blotting with IR-dye labelled antibodies. Pharmacokinetics of 5 prototypic cytochrome P450 substrate drugs were measured by cassette dosing and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were analysed by MANOVA and post hoc univariate analysis of variance.ResultsThe great majority of enzyme mRNAs were down-regulated, with the greatest effects occurring at the peak of parasitaemia 8days post infection. Protein levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the Cyp 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 3a and 4a subfamilies were also down-regulated. Several distinct groups differing in their temporal patterns of regulation were identified. The cassette dosing study revealed that at the peak of parasitaemia, the clearances of caffeine, bupropion, tolbutamide and midazolam were markedly reduced by 60-70%.ConclusionsThese findings in a model of uncomplicated human malaria suggest that changes in drug clearance in this condition may be of sufficient magnitude to cause significant alterations in exposure and response of anti-malarial drugs and co-medications.

TI Mass Drug Administration With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and Malaria
   Transmission Dynamics in The Gambia: A Prospective Cohort Study
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Mass drug administration (MDA) may further reduce malaria transmission in low-transmission areas. The impact of MDA on the dynamics of malaria transmission was determined in a prospective cohort study.
   Methods. Annual rounds of MDA with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) were implemented were implemented in 2014 and 2015 in six village pairs before the malaria transmission season. Blood samples were collected from residents between July and December for microscopy and nested PCR. Incidence and prevalence of infection, clinical disease, and risk of malaria reinfection post-MDA were determined.
   Results. Coverage of three DP doses was 68.2% (2014) and 65.6% (2015), compliance was greater than 80%. Incidence of infection was significantly lower in 2014 (incidence rate [IR] = 0.2 per person year [PPY]) than in 2013 (IR = 1.1 PPY; P < .01); monthly infection prevalence declined in the first three months post-MDA. Clinical malaria incidence was lower in 2014 (IR = 0.1 PPY) and 2015 (IR = 0.2 PPY) than in 2013 (IR = 0.4 PPY; P < .01), but remained higher in eastern Gambia. Individuals infected before MDA had a 2-fold higher odds of reinfection post-MDA (adjusted odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.5-4.3; P < .01).
   Conclusions. MDA reduced malaria infection and clinical disease during the first months. The reduction was maintained in low-transmission areas, but not in eastern Gambia. Annual MDA could be followed by focal MDA targeting individuals infected during the dry season. Repeated MDA rounds, some during the dry season over larger geographical areas, may result in a more marked and sustained decrease of malaria transmission.

TI Temporal changes in Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding protein
   homolog 2b (PfRh2b) in Senegal and The Gambia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homolog 2b (PfRh2b) is an important P. falciparum merozoite ligand that mediates invasion of erythrocytes by interacting with a chymotrypsin-sensitive receptor Z. A large deletion polymorphism is found in the c-terminal ectodomain of this protein in many countries around the world, resulting in a truncated, but expressed protein. The varying frequencies by region suggest that there could be region specific immune selection at this locus. Therefore, this study was designed to determine temporal changes in the PfRh2b deletion polymorphism in infected individuals from Thies (Senegal) and Western Gambia (The Gambia). It was also sought to determine the selective pressures acting at this locus and whether prevalence of the deletion in isolates genotyped by a 24-SNP molecular barcode is linked to background genotype or whether there might be independent selection acting at this locus.MethodsInfected blood samples were sourced from archives of previous studies conducted between 2007 and 2013 at SLAP clinic in Thies and from 1984 to 2013 in Western Gambia by MRC Unit at LSHTM, The Gambia. A total of 1380 samples were screened for the dimorphic alleles of the PfRh2b using semi-nested Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR. Samples from Thies were previously barcoded.ResultsIn Thies, a consistent trend of decreasing prevalence of the PfRh2b deletion over time was observed: from 66.54% in 2007 and to 38.1% in 2013. In contrast, in Western Gambia, the frequency of the deletion fluctuated over time; it increased between 1984 and 2005 from (58.04%) to (69.33%) and decreased to 47.47% in 2007. Between 2007 and 2012, the prevalence of this deletion increased significantly from 47.47 to 83.02% and finally declined significantly to 57.94% in 2013. Association between the presence of this deletion and age was found in Thies, however, not in Western Gambia. For the majority of isolates, the PfRh2b alleles could be tracked with specific 24-SNP barcoded genotype, indicating a lack of independent selection at this locus.ConclusionPfRh2b deletion was found in the two countries with varying prevalence during the study period. However, these temporal and spatial variations could be an obstacle to the implementation of this protein as a potential vaccine candidate.

TI Changing pattern of the genetic diversities of Plasmodium falciparum
   merozoite surface protein-1 and merozoite surface protein-2 in Myanmar
   isolates
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1) and -2 (PfMSP-2) are major blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens. Understanding the genetic diversity of the genes, pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2, is important for recognizing the genetic structure of P. falciparum, and the development of an effective vaccine based on the antigens. In this study, the genetic diversities of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the Myanmar P. falciparum were analysed.MethodsThe pfmsp-1 block 2 and pfmsp-2 block 3 regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from blood samples collected from Myanmar patients who were infected with P. falciparum in 2013-2015. The amplified gene fragments were cloned into a T&A vector, and sequenced. Sequence analysis of Myanmar pfmsp-1 block 2 and pfmsp-2 block 3 was performed to identify the genetic diversity of the regions. The temporal genetic changes of both pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the Myanmar P. falciparum population, as well as the polymorphic diversity in the publicly available global pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2, were also comparatively analysed.ResultsHigh levels of genetic diversity of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 were observed in the Myanmar P. falciparum isolates. Twenty-eight different alleles of pfmsp-1 (8 for K1 type, 14 for MAD20 type, and 6 for RO33 type) and 59 distinct alleles of pfmsp-2 (18 for FC27, and 41 for 3D7 type) were identified in the Myanmar P. falciparum population in amino acid level. Comparative analyses of the genetic diversity of the Myanmar pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 alleles in the recent (2013-2015) and past (2004-2006) Myanmar P. falciparum populations indicated the dynamic genetic expansion of the pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in recent years, suggesting that a high level of genetic differentiation and recombination of the two genes may be maintained. Population genetic structure analysis of the global pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 also suggested that a high level of genetic diversity of the two genes was found in the global P. falciparum population.ConclusionDespite the recent remarkable decline of malaria cases, the Myanmar P. falciparum population still remains of sufficient size to allow the generation and maintenance of genetic diversity. The high level of genetic diversity of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the global P. falciparum population emphasizes the necessity for continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of the genes for better understanding of the genetic make-up and evolutionary aspect of the genes in the global P. falciparum population.

TI Prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infection in immigrants living in
   Spain
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The importance of submicroscopic malaria infections in high-transmission areas could contribute to maintain the parasite cycle. Regarding non-endemic areas, its importance remains barely understood because parasitaemia in these afebrile patients is usually below the detection limits for microscopy, hence molecular techniques are often needed for its diagnosis. In addition to this, the lack of standardized protocols for the screening of submicroscopic malaria in immigrants from endemic areas may underestimate the infection with Plasmodium spp. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of submicroscopic malaria in afebrile immigrants living in a non-endemic area.
   Methods: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted. Afebrile immigrants were included, microscopic observation of Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears, and two different molecular techniques detecting Plasmodium spp. were performed. Patients with submicroscopic malaria were defined as patients with negative blood smears and detection of DNA of Plasmodium spp. with one or both molecular techniques. Demographic, clinical, analytical and microbiological features were recorded and univariate analysis by subgroups was carried out with STATA v15.
   Results: A total of 244 afebrile immigrants were included in the study. Of them, 14 had a submicroscopic malaria infection, yielding a prevalence of 5.7% (95% confidence interval 3.45-9.40). In 71.4% of the positive PCR/negative microscopy cases, Plasmodium falciparum alone was the main detected species (10 out of the 14 patients) and in 4 cases (28.6%) Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale were detected. One patient had a mixed infection including three different species.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of submicroscopic malaria in afebrile immigrants was similar to that previously described in Spain. Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale were detected in almost a third of the submicroscopic infections. Screening protocols for afebrile immigrants with molecular techniques could be useful for a proper management of these patients.

TI Malaria surveillance from both ends: concurrent detection of Plasmodium
   falciparum in saliva and excreta harvested from Anopheles mosquitoes
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Malaria is the most important vector-borne disease in the world. Epidemiological and ecological studies of malaria traditionally utilize detection of Plasmodium sporozoites in whole mosquitoes or salivary glands by microscopy or serological or molecular assays. However, these methods are labor-intensive, and can over- or underestimate mosquito transmission potential. To overcome these limitations, alternative sample types have been evaluated for the study of malaria. It was recently shown that Plasmodium could be detected in saliva expectorated on honey-soaked cards by Anopheles stephensi, providing a better estimate of transmission risk. We evaluated whether excretion of Plasmodium falciparum nucleic acid by An. stephensi correlates with expectoration of parasites in saliva, thus providing an additional sample type for estimating transmission potential. Mosquitoes were exposed to infectious blood meals containing cultured gametocytes, and excreta collected at different time points post-exposure. Saliva was collected on honey-soaked filter paper cards, and salivary glands were dissected and examined microscopically for sporozoites. Excreta and saliva samples were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR).
   Results: Plasmodium falciparum RNA was detected in mosquito excreta as early as four days after ingesting a bloodmeal containing gametocytes. Once sporogony (the development of sporozoites) occurred, P. falciparum RNA was detected concurrently in both excreta and saliva samples. In the majority of cases, no difference was observed between the C-t values obtained from matched excreta and saliva samples, suggesting that both samples provide equally sensitive results. A positive association was observed between the molecular detection of the parasites in both samples and the proportion of mosquitoes with sporozoites in their salivary glands from each container. No distinguishable parasites were observed when excreta samples were stained and microscopically analyzed.
   Conclusions: Mosquito saliva and excreta are easily collected and are promising for surveillance of malaria-causing parasites, especially in low transmission settings or in places where arboviruses co-circulate.

TI Effect of different habitat types on abundance and biting times of
   Anopheles balabacensis Baisas (Diptera: Culicidae) in Kudat district of
   Sabah, Malaysia
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundWe investigated the effect of five common habitat types on the diversity and abundance of Anopheles spp. and on the biting rate and time of Anopheles balabacensis (currently the only known vector for Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah) at Paradason village, Kudat, Sabah. The habitats were forest edge, playground area, longhouse, oil palm plantation and shrub-bushes area. Sampling of Anopheles was done monthly using the human landing catch method in all habitat types for 14 months (October 2013 to December 2014, excluding June 2014). The Anopheles species were morphologically identified and subjected to PCR assay for the detection of Plasmodium parasites. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) were applied to test the variation in abundance and biting rates of An. balabacensis in different habitat types.ResultsA total of 1599 Anopheles specimens were collected in the village, of which about 90% were An. balabacensis. Anopheles balabacensis was present throughout the year and was the dominant Anopheles species in all habitat types. The shrub bushes habitat had the highest Anopheles species diversity while forest edge had the greatest number of Anopheles individuals caught. GLMM analysis indicated that An. balabacensis abundance was not affected by the type of habitats, and it was more active during the early and late night compared to predawn and dawn. PCR assay showed that 1.61% of the tested An. balabacensis were positive for malaria parasites, most of which were caught in oil palm estates and infected with one to two Plasmodium species.ConclusionsThe identification of infected vectors in a range of habitats, including agricultural and farming areas, illustrates the potential for humans to be exposed to P. knowlesi outside forested areas. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence implicating environmental changes due to deforestation, expansion of agricultural and farming areas, and development of human settlements near to forest fringes in the emergence of P. knowlesi in Sabah.

TI Proof of concept: used malaria rapid diagnostic tests applied for
   parallel sequencing for surveillance of molecular markers of
   anti-malarial resistance in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau during 2014-2017
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundLarge-scale surveillance of molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance is an attractive method of resistance monitoring, to complement therapeutic efficacy studies in settings where the latter are logistically challenging.MethodsBetween 2014 and 2017, this study sampled malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), used in routine clinical care, from two health centres in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. In order to obtain epidemiological insights, RDTs were collected together with patient data on age and sex. A subset of positive RDTs from one of the two sites (n=2184) were tested for Plasmodium DNA content. Those testing positive for Plasmodium DNA by PCR (n=1390) were used for library preparation, custom designed dual indexing and next generation Miseq targeted sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum genes pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfk13.ResultsThe study found a high frequency of the pfmdr1 codon 86N at 88-97%, a significant decrease of the pfcrt wildtype CVMNK haplotype and elevated levels of the pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutant ranging from 33 to 51% between 2014 and 2017. No polymorphisms indicating artemisinin tolerance were discovered. The demographic data indicate a large proportion of young adults (66%, interquartile range 11-28years) presenting with P. falciparum infections. While a total of 5532 gene fragments were successfully analysed on a single Illumina Miseq flow cell, PCR-positivity from the library preparation varied considerably from 13 to 87% for different amplicons. Furthermore, pre-screening of samples for Plasmodium DNA content proved necessary prior to library preparation.ConclusionsThis study serves as a proof of concept for using leftover clinical material (used RDTs) for large-scale molecular surveillance, encompassing the inherent complications regarding to methodology and analysis when doing so. Factors such as RDT storage prior to DNA extraction and parasitaemia of the infection are likely to have an effect on whether or not parasite DNA can be successfully analysed, and are considered part of the reason the data yield is suboptimal. However, given the necessity of molecular surveillance of anti-malarial resistance in settings where poor infrastructure, poor economy, lack of educated staff and even surges of political instability remain major obstacles to performing clinical studies, obtaining the necessary data from used RDTs, despite suboptimal output, becomes a feasible, affordable and hence a justifiable method.

TI Anopheles parensis contributes to residual malaria transmission in South
   Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundUnderstanding the contribution of outdoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes to residual malaria transmission is important in terms of scaling up vector control towards malaria elimination in South Africa. The aim of this project was to assess the potential role of Anopheles parensis and other Anopheles species in residual malaria transmission, using sentinel surveillance sites in the uMkhanyakude District of northern KwaZulu-Natal Province.MethodsMonthly vector surveillance was conducted at the sentinel sites from January 2017 to May 2018. Outdoor-placed clay pot resting traps were used to collect male and female adult Anopheles mosquitoes. All Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group specimens collected were identified to species and all females were screened for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples showing infectivity for P. falciparum were further verified by a nested PCR and subsequent DNA sequence analysis.ResultsFrom a sample of 491 anophelines, Anopheles arabiensis (n=228) and An. parensis (n=194) were the most abundant. Other species collected included Anopheles merus (n=11), Anopheles quadriannulatus (n=10), Anopheles leesoni (n=29), Anopheles rivulorum (n=18), and Anopheles vaneedeni (n=1). Of the 317 female specimens screened for P. falciparum CSP, one Anopheles arabiensis and one An. parensis showed positive by ELISA and Plasmodium nested PCR. For the An. parensis specimen, confirmation of its species identity was based on sequence analysis of the ITS2 region, and the presence of P. falciparum DNA was further confirmed by sequence analysis.ConclusionsAnopheles parensis is a potential vector of malaria in South Africa although its contribution to transmission is likely to be minimal at best owing to its strong zoophilic tendency. By contrast, An. arabiensis is a major vector that is primarily responsible for the bulk of residual malaria transmission in South Africa. As all recently collected sporozoite-positive Anopheles mosquitoes were found in outdoor-placed resting traps, it is necessary to introduce interventions that can be used to control outdoor-resting vector populations while maintaining the efficacy of South Africa's indoor house spraying operations.

TI Impact of Microscopic and Submicroscopic Parasitemia During Pregnancy on
   Placental Malaria in a High-Transmission Setting in Uganda
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB In pregnant women assessed for parasitemia every 28days, the risk of placental malaria increased in a dose-response relationship with both increasing frequency and density of parasitemia; however, even women with only submicroscopic parasitemia were at risk for placental malaria.
   Abstract
   Background Placental malaria is a major cause of adverse birth outcomes. However, data are limited on the relationships between longitudinal measures of parasitemia during pregnancy and placental malaria.
   Methods Data came from 637 women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) from Uganda. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was assessed using microscopy and ultrasensitive quantitative PCR at intervals of 28 days from 12 to 20 weeks gestation through delivery. Multivariate analysis was used to measure associations between characteristics of parasitemia during pregnancy and the risk of placental malaria based on histopathology.
   Results Overall risk of placental malaria was 44.6%. None of the 34 women without parasitemia detected during pregnancy had evidence of placental malaria. Increasing proportion of interval assessments with parasitemia and higher parasite densities were independently associated with an increased risk of placental malaria. Higher gravidity and more effective IPTp were associated with a decreased risk of placental malaria. Women with parasitemia only detected before the third trimester still had an increased risk of placental malaria.
   Conclusions The frequency, density, and timing of parasitemia are all important risk factors for placental malaria. Interventions should target the prevention of all levels of parasitemia throughout pregnancy.

TI Distribution of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C8*2 allele in Brazzaville,
   Republic of Congo
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are essential in the metabolism of most drugs used today. Single nucleotide polymorphism(s) occurring in CYP genes can adversely affect drug pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. Individuals carrying the CYP2C8*2 c.805A > T (CYP2C8*2; rs11572103) allele have impaired amodiaquine metabolism, increased risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events, and may promote the selection of drug-resistant parasite strains. This study investigated the distribution of the CYP2C8*2 allele in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, where artesunate + amodiaquine is used as the second-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
   Methods: A total of 285 febrile children visiting the Marien Ngouabi paediatric hospital were genotyped for CYP2C8*2 using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The allele frequencies and genotype distribution were determined.
   Results: The CYP2C8*2 allele was successfully genotyped in 75% (213/285) of the study participants. The CYP2C8*2A allele had a frequency of 63%, whereas the CYP2C8*2T allele had a frequency of 37%. Genotypes CYP2C8*2AA (rapid metabolizer), CYP2C8*2AT (intermediate metabolizer), and CYP2C8*2TT (poor metabolizer) were observed in 44%, 38%, and 18% of the investigated participants, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study gives the first description of CYP2C8*2 allele distribution in the Republic of Congo and highlights the potential risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events. Information from this study will be beneficial during pharmacovigilance investigations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI Diversity and immune responses against Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes
   in non-febrile school children living in Southern Ghana
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Natural exposure to gametocytes can result in the development of immunity against the gametocyte by the host as well as genetic diversity in the gametocyte. This study evaluated the quantity and quality of natural immune responses against a gametocyte antigen, Pfs230 as well as the prevalence and diversity of gametocytes circulating in children living in two communities in southern Ghana.
   Methods: Whole blood (2.5 ml) was collected from 137 non-febrile school children aged between 6 and 12 years old quarterly for a 6-month period. A drop of blood was used to prepare thick and thin blood films for parasite prevalence and density estimation. Subsequently, stored plasma samples were used in ELISAs assays to measure antibody responses and avidity against Pfs230. RNA was extraction from Trizol preserved packed cells and subsequently converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) which was used for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to determine gametocytes prevalence and diversity.
   Results: Gametocyte carriage in the peak season (July) determined by Pfg377 RT-PCR was 49.2% in Obom and 22.2% in Abura, and was higher than that determined by microscopy. Gametocyte diversity was low and predominated by the same allele at both sites. The relative avidity index for antibodies measured in Abura was higher than that recorded in Obom at all time points although Pfs230 IgG concentrations were significantly high (P < 0.0001) in Obom than in Abura at all time points. The IgG responses in Obom were significantly higher than that in Abura during the peak season.
   Conclusion: Naturally induced antibody responses against Pfs230 in children living in both high perennial and low seasonal malaria transmission settings reduced significantly in moving from the peak to the off-peak season. The relative avidity of antibodies against Pfs230 in Abura was significantly higher than those measured in Obom, despite having lower IgG levels. Very limited diversity was identified in the gametocytes circulating in both Obom and Abura.

TI Kelch 13 propeller gene polymorphism among Plasmodium falciparum
   isolates in Lagos, Nigeria: Molecular Epidemiologic Study
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB Objective To assess polymorphism in Kelch 13 gene of Plasmodium falciparum isolates in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods 195 Plasmodium falciparum-positive dried blood spots collected from individuals that accessed diagnostic care at some health facilities and during community surveys across several Local Government Areas of Lagos State, Nigeria, were investigated for the presence of mutations in the K13 gene by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using haplotype-specific probes and sequencing. Results Three mutant genotypes of K13 gene were observed: A578S in 0.5%, D464N in 0.5% and Q613H in 1.5%. The frequency of K13 polymorphism was 3.1%, while the remaining parasite population had the wild K13 propeller genes. Conclusion No validated Kelch 13 polymorphism associated with artemisinin resistance was seen among P. falciparum isolates from Lagos, Nigeria. As no clinical study was done, this could not be correlated with artemisinin sensitivity.

TI Molecular surveillance of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes deletion in Plasmodium
   falciparum isolates and the implications for rapid diagnostic tests in
   Nigeria
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malaria remain the hallmark for reducing malaria-related mortality in high transmission areas. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein2 (PfHRP2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) play a vital role in prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis. However, pfhrp2 gene deletion threatens the RDT test sensitivity. This study reports the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes deletion among parasite isolates in Nigeria. Febrile children were screened using histidine-rich protein (HRP2) specific RDT (SD-Bioline RDT) and microscopy for P. falciparum infections. All RDT negative samples were re-evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of parasite in RDT false negative cases and randomly selected RDT positive cases were validated using PCRs targeting glutamate-rich protein (glurp) and merozoite surface proteins (msp-1 and msp-2). Thereafter, exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 were amplified, and Sanger sequenced. A total of 511 febrile children were enrolled out of which 309 (61%) were positive by RDT. The presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes were analyzed in 66 PCR positive samples comprising of 31 RDT false negative and 35 RDT true positive randomly selected samples. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes failed to amplify in 17% (11/66) and 6% (4/66) samples, respectively. Seven of the eleven samples had only pfhrp2 deletion while four had both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. The absence of the pfhrp2 gene may be responsible for the seven RDT false negative cases observed. Three RDT positive cases lacked pfhrp2 whereas pfhrp3 was absent in only four RDT false negative cases. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 amino acid repeat sequences were highly diverse. The P. falciparum isolates lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes may be circulating and contributing to RDT false negativity in Nigeria. More studies in larger population and seasonally defined cases will be needed to determine the extent of pfhrp2/3 genes deletion in different geographical areas of Nigeria.

TI Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency genotypes and allele
   frequencies in the Kavango and Zambezi regions of northern Namibia
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background Namibia has made significant gains in the fight against malaria, with a target of elimination by 2023. We examined the genotype and allele frequencies of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency to inform decisions on primaquine use, as we recently detected clusters of Plasmodium ovale curtisi in Kavango.
   Methods A multistaged cross-sectional sampling method was used to enrol 212 children 2-9 y of age from schools and clinics in the Okavango and Zambezi regions of northern Namibia. Genotypes for the 202 G -> A and 376 A -> G mutations were assigned by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism.
   Results Of the 212 subjects enrolled, genotypes were available for 210, made up of 61 males and 149 females. G6PD-deficient males (hemizygotes) and females (homozygotes) constituted 3.27% (2/61) and 0.0% (0/149), respectively. Female heterozygotes (AA- and BA-) constituted 10.07% (15/149), while G6PD wild-type males (with A or B haplotype) and females (with AA, BB or AB haplotypes) consisted of 96.72% (59/61) and 89.93% (134/149), respectively. The A-, A and B allele frequencies were 0.0474, 0.3036 and 0.6490, respectively. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests for female genotype frequencies did not show deviation (p=0.29).
   Conclusions The frequency of G6PD deficiency alleles in males in the Kavango and Zambezi regions of northern Namibia constitute 3.27%, a first report to inform policy on primaquine role out.

   Administered as Chemoprophylaxis to Healthy, Nonimmune Participants
   Followed by Blood Stage Plasmodium falciparum Challenge: A Randomized,
   Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 1b Study
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Tafenoquine was recently approved for chemoprophylaxis of malaria. Its specific activity against liver and blood stages of Plasmodium species has been separately characterized in animals but not in humans.
   Methods. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 16 malaria-naive, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-normal participants aged 20-42 years received tafenoquine chemoprophylaxis prior to challenge with blood stage Plasmodium falciparum. Participants were randomly assigned to either tafenoquine (n = 12) or placebo (n = 4) and took blinded study medication (single 200-mg dose) on days 1, 2, 3, and 10, followed by intravenous inoculation with approximately 2800 P. falciparum parasitized erythrocytes on day 13. The primary endpoint was the number of participants requiring rescue treatment with artemether/lumefantrine due to the onset of parasitemia as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. None of the 12 participants who received tafenoquine developed parasitemia, whereas all placebo participants developed parasitemia (P = .0005). Two cases of mild hemoglobin decrease and a single case of mild hyperbilirubinemia occurred in the tafenoquine group.
   Conclusions. Tafenoquine chemoprophylaxis is safe and effective in preventing malaria in healthy nonimmune participants challenged with blood stage P. falciparum.

TI Comparative and functional genomics of the protozoan parasite Babesia
   divergens highlighting the invasion and egress processes
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Babesiosis is considered an emerging disease because its incidence has significantly increased in the last 30 years, providing evidence of the expanding range of this rare but potentially life-threatening zoonotic disease. Babesia divergens is a causative agent of babesiosis in humans and cattle in Europe. The recently sequenced genome of B. divergens revealed over 3,741 protein coding-genes and the 10.7-Mb high-quality draft become the first reference tool to study the genome structure of B. divergens. Now, by exploiting this sequence data and using new computational tools and assembly strategies, we have significantly improved the quality of the B. divergens genome. The new assembly shows better continuity and has a higher correspondence to B. bovis chromosomes. Moreover, we present a differential expression analysis using RNA sequencing of the two different stages of the asexual lifecycle of B. divergens: the free merozoite capable of invading erythrocytes and the intraerythrocytic parasite stage that remains within the erythrocyte until egress. Comparison of mRNA levels of both stages identified 1,441 differentially expressed genes. From these, around half were upregulated and the other half downregulated in the intraerythrocytic stage. Orthogonal validation by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR confirmed the differential expression. A moderately increased expression level of genes, putatively involved in the invasion and egress processes, were revealed in the intraerythrocytic stage compared with the free merozoite. On the basis of these results and in the absence of molecular models of invasion and egress for B. divergens, we have proposed the identified genes as putative molecular players in the invasion and egress processes. Our results contribute to an understanding of key parasitic strategies and pathogenesis and could be a valuable genomic resource to exploit for the design of diagnostic methods, drugs and vaccines to improve the control of babesiosis.

TI Efficacy of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments for
   uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy: a protocol for systematic
   review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction Pregnant women are more vulnerable to malaria leading to adverse impact on both mothers and fetuses. However, knowledge on the efficacy and safety of antimalarials in pregnancy is limited by the paucity of randomised control trials and the lack of standardised protocols in this special subpopulation. Pooling individual patient data (IPD) for meta-analysis could address in part these limitations to summarise accurately the currently available evidence on treatment efficacy and risk factors for treatment failure.
   Methods and analysis To assess the treatment efficacy of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy, seven databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciencias da Saude) and two clinical trial registries (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrial.gov) were searched. Both interventional and observational cohort studies following up for at least 28 days will be included. IPD of the identified eligible published or unpublished studies will be sought by inviting principal investigators. Raw IPD will be shared through the web-based secure platform developed by the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network using the established methodology. The primary objective is to compare the risk of PCR-corrected treatment failure among different treatments and to find the risk factors. One-stage IPD meta-analysis by Cox model with shared frailty will be conducted. A risk of bias assessment will be conducted to address the impact of unshared potential data and of the quality of individual studies. Potential limitations include difficulty in acquiring the IPD and heterogeneity of the study designs due to the lack of standard.
   Ethics and dissemination This IPD meta-analysis consists of secondary analyses of existing anonymous data and meets the criteria for waiver of ethics review by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. The results of this IPD meta-analysis will be disseminated through open-access publications at peer-reviewed journals. The study results will lead to a better understanding of malaria treatment in pregnancy, which can be used for clinical decision-making and conducting further studies.

TI Impact of Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum Parasitaemia on Maternal
   Anaemia and Low Birth Weight in Blue Nile State, Sudan
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of submicroscopic infections and to assess its impact on maternal anaemia and low birth weight. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1149 consented pregnant women who delivered at 3 main hospitals in the Blue Nile State, between January 2012 and December 2015. From a matched maternal peripheral, placental maternal side, and cord blood sample, blood films and dried spots were prepared for microscopic examination and nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR), respectively. 107 out of 447 negative blood films were found to have submicroscopic infection detected using n-PCR in any of the three compartments. Placental samples had a significantly higher prevalence (142) of submicroscopic infections compared with the peripheral (6.5%) and cord (8.1%) samples. The mean (SD) of the maternal haemoglobin (Hb) was significantly lower in cases with submicroscopic parasitaemia (10.9 (0.8) vs. 12.1 (0.7)g/dl, P<0.001) compared with those who had no submicroscopic parasitaemia. Submicroscopic malaria infection was associated with anaemia (OR 19.7, (95% CI, 10.3-37.8)). Thirty-eight babies born to women with submicroscopic infections were low birth weight (LBW) and was significantly lower in submicroscopic parasitaemia (2.663 (0.235) vs. 2.926 (0.341)kg, P<0.001). Submicroscopic malaria infection was associated with LBW (OR=2.7, (95% CI, 1.2-5.6)). There is a high incidence of submicroscopic infections in any of the three compartments regardless of age or parity. Submicroscopic infection is a risk of maternal anaemia and low birth weight in women in this area of high seasonal malaria transmission.

TI TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms (G-238A and G-308A) are associated with
   susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and P. falciparum
   malaria: a study in malaria endemic area
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Importance ofTNF-alpha in P. falciparum malaria and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been demonstrated. However, association of functional promoter variants with SLE and malaria is lacking in malaria endemic population. A total of 204 female SLE patients and 224 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Three hundred fourteen P. falciparum infected patients with different clinical phenotypes were included. TNF-alpha polymorphisms (G-238A & G-308A) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha was quantified by ELISA. Heterozygous mutants and minor alleles of TNF-alpha (G-238A and G-308A) polymorphisms were significantly higher in SLE patients compared to healthy controls and associated with development of lupus nephritis. In addition, both promoter variants were associated with severe P. falciparum malaria. SLE patients demonstrated higher levels of plasma TNF-alpha compared to healthy controls. TNF-alpha (G-238A and G-308A) variants were associated with higher plasma TNF-alpha. In conclusion, TNF-alpha (G-238A & G-308A) variants are associated with higher plasma TNF-alpha levels in SLE patients residing in malaria endemic areas and could be a contributing factor in the development of SLE and susceptibility to severe P. falciparum malaria.

TI The use of GPS data loggers to describe the impact of spatio-temporal
   movement patterns on malaria control in a high-transmission area of
   northern Zambia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
AB Background Human movement is a driver of malaria transmission and has implications for sustainable malaria control. However, little research has been done on the impact of fine-scale movement on malaria transmission and control in high-transmission settings. As interest in targeted malaria control increases, evaluations are needed to determine the appropriateness of these strategies in the context of human mobility across a variety of transmission settings. Methods A human mobility study was conducted in Nchelenge District, a high-transmission setting in northern Zambia. Over 1 year, 84 participants were recruited from active malaria surveillance cohorts to wear a global positioning system data logger for 1 month during all daily activity. Participants completed a survey questionnaire and underwent malaria testing and treatment at the time of logger distribution and at collection 1 month later. Incident malaria infections were identified using polymerase chain reaction. Participant movement was characterized throughout the study area and across areas targeted for an indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention. Participant movement patterns were compared using movement intensity maps, activity space plots, and statistical analyses. Malaria risk was characterized across participants using spatial risk maps and time spent away from home during peak vector biting hours. Results Movement data were collected from 82 participants, and 63 completed a second study visit. Participants exhibited diverse mobility patterns across the study area, including movement into and out of areas targeted for IRS, potentially mitigating the impact of IRS on parasite prevalence. Movement patterns did not differ significantly by season or age, but male participants traveled longer distances and spent more time away from home. Monthly malaria incidence was 22%, and malaria risk was characterized as high across participants. Participants with incident parasitemia traveled a shorter distance and spent more time away from home during peak biting hours; however, these relationships were not statistically significant, and malaria risk score did not differ by incident parasitemia. Conclusions Individual movement patterns in Nchelenge District, Zambia have implications for malaria control, particularly the effectiveness of targeted IRS strategies. Large and fine-scale population mobility patterns should be considered when planning intervention strategies across transmission settings.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium parasites in non-human primates and mosquitoes
   in areas with different degrees of fragmentation in Colombia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Parasites from the genus Plasmodium, the aetiological agent of malaria in humans, can also infect non-human primates (NHP), increasing the potential risk of zoonotic transmission with its associated global public health concerns. In Colombia, there are no recent studies on Plasmodium spp. infecting free-ranging NHP. Thus, this study aimed to determine the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in fragmented forests in central Colombia, both in Anopheles mosquitoes and in the four sympatric NHP in the region (Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor, Alouatta seniculus and Aotus griseimembra), in order to evaluate the risk of infection to humans associated with the presence of sylvatic hosts and vectors infected with Plasmodium spp. Methods Overall, there were collected 166 fecal samples and 25 blood samples from NHP, and 442 individuals of Anopheles spp. DNA extraction, nested PCR using mitochondrial (cox3 gene) and ribosomal (18S rDNA) primers, electrophoresis and sequencing were conducted in order to identify Plasmodium spp. from the samples. Results Plasmodium falciparum was detected in two fecal samples of Alouatta seniculus, while Plasmodium vivax/simium infected Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor and Alouatta seniculus. Co-infections with P. vivax/simium and Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum were found in three individuals. The highest prevalence from blood samples was found for Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum in two Alouatta seniculus while Plasmodium vivax/simium was most prevalent in fecal samples, infecting four individuals of Alouatta seniculus. Seven Anopheles species were identified in the study site: Anopheles (Anopheles) punctimacula, Anopheles (An.) malefactor, Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) oswaldoi, Anopheles (Nys.) triannulatus, Anopheles (An.) neomaculipalpus, Anopheles (Nys.) braziliensis and Anopheles (Nys.) nuneztovari. Infection with P. vivax/simium was found in An. nuneztovari, An. neomaculipalpus, and An. triannulatus. Furthermore, An. oswaldoi and An. triannulatus were found infected with P. malariae/brasilianum. The effect of fragmentation and distance to the nearest town measured in five forests with different degrees of fragmentation was not statistically significant on the prevalence of Plasmodium in NHP, but forest fragmentation did have an effect on the Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) in Anopheles mosquitoes. Conclusions The presence of Plasmodium spp. in NHP and Anopheles spp. in fragmented forests in Colombia has important epidemiological implications in the human-NHP interface and the associated risk of malaria transmission.

TI Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treatment of
   Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria in adult patients on
   antiretroviral therapy in Malawi and Mozambique: an open label
   non-randomized interventional trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) require treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) when infected with malaria. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DPQ) is recommended for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but its efficacy and safety has not been evaluated in HIV-infected individuals on ART, among whom drug-drug interactions are expected. Day-42 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) and incidence of adverse events were assessed in HIV-infected individuals on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART (efavirenz and nevirapine) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Methods An open label single arm clinical trial was conducted in Malawi (Blantyre and Chikhwawa districts) and Mozambique (Manhica district) involving patients aged 15-65 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria who were on efavirenz-based or nevirapine-based ART. They received a directly-observed 3-day standard treatment of DPQ and were followed up until day 63 for malaria infection and adverse events. Day-42 PCR-corrected-ACPRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Results The study enrolled 160 and 61 patients on efavirenz and nevirapine-based ART, with a baseline geometric mean (95% CI) parasite density of 2681 (1964-3661) and 9819 (6606-14,593) parasites/mu L, respectively. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR (95% CI) was 99.4% (95.6-99.9%) in the efavirenz group and 100% in the nevirapine group. Serious adverse events occurred in 5.0% (8/160) and 3.3% (2/61) of the participants in the efavirenz and nevirapine group, respectively, but none were definitively attributable to DPQ. Cases of prolonged QT interval (> 60 ms from baseline) occurred in 31.2% (48/154) and 13.3% (8/60) of the patients on the efavirenz and nevirapine ART groups, respectively. These were not clinically significant and resolved spontaneously over time. As this study was not designed to compare the efficacy and safety of DPQ in the two ART groups, no formal statistical comparisons were made between the two ART groups. Conclusions DPQ was highly efficacious and safe for the treatment of malaria in HIV-infected patients concurrently taking efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART, despite known pharmacokinetic interactions between dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART regimens.

TI Absence of kelch13 artemisinin resistance markers but strong selection
   for lumefantrine-tolerance molecular markers following 18 years of
   artemisinin-based combination therapy use in Mpumalanga Province, South
   Africa (2001-2018)
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The ability of Plasmodium falciparum parasites to develop resistance to widely used anti-malarials threatens malaria control and elimination efforts. Regular drug efficacy monitoring is essential for ensuring effective treatment policies. In low transmission settings where therapeutic efficacy studies are often not feasible, routine surveillance for molecular markers associated with anti-malarial resistance provides an alternative for the early detection of emerging resistance. Such a longitudinal survey of changes in the prevalence of selected molecular markers of resistance was conducted in the malaria-endemic regions of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, where malaria elimination at a district-level is being pursued. Methods Molecular analyses to determine the prevalence of alleles associated with resistance to lumefantrine (mdr86N, crt76K and mdr1 copy number variation) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (dhfr triple, dhps double, SP quintuple) were conducted between 2001 and 2018, while artemisinin resistance markers (kelch13 mutations) were assessed only in 2018. Results Parasite DNA was successfully amplified from 1667/2393 (70%) of malaria-positive rapid diagnostic tests routinely collected at primary health care facilities. No artemisinin resistance-associated kelch13 mutations nor amplification of the mdr1 gene copy number associated with lumefantrine resistance were observed. However, prevalence of both the mdr86N and crt76K alleles increased markedly over the study period, with all isolates collected in 2018 carrying these markers. SP quintuple mutation prevalence increased steadily from 14% in 2001 to 96% in 2018. Mixed alleles at any of the codons assessed were rare by 2018. Conclusion No kelch13 mutations confirmed or suspected to be associated with artemisinin resistance were identified in 2018. Although parasites carrying the mdr86N and crt76K alleles associated with reduced lumefantrine susceptibility were strongly selected for over the study period, nearing fixation by 2018, the marker for lumefantrine resistance, namely increased mdr1 copy number, was not observed in this study. The increase in mdr86N and crt76K allele prevalence together with intense regional artemether-lumefantrine drug pressure, raises concern regarding the sustained artemether-lumefantrine efficacy. Regular, rigorous anti-malarial resistance marker surveillance across all three South African malaria-endemic provinces to inform case management is recommended.

TI Field performance of the malaria highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test
   in a setting of varying malaria transmission
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe Gambia has successfully reduced malaria transmission. The human reservoir of infection could further decrease if malaria-infected individuals could be identified by highly sensitive, field-based, diagnostic tools and then treated.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was done at the peak of the 2017 malaria season in 47 Gambian villages. From each village, 100 residents were randomly selected for finger-prick blood samples to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections using highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tests (HS-RDT) and PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the HS-RDT were estimated (assuming PCR as the gold standard) across varying transmission intensities and in different age groups. A deterministic, age-structured, dynamic model of malaria transmission was used to estimate the impact of mass testing and treatment (MTAT) with HS-RDT in four different scenarios of malaria prevalence by PCR: 5, 15, 30, and 60%, and with seasonal transmission. The impact was compared both to MTAT with conventional RDT and mass drug administration (MDA).ResultsMalaria prevalence by HS-RDT was 15% (570/3798; 95% CI 13.9-16.1). The HS-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 38.4% (191/497, 95% CI 34.2-42.71) and 88.5% (2922/3301; 95% CI 87.4-89.6), respectively. Sensitivity was the highest (50.9%, 95% CI 43.3-58.5%) in high prevalence villages (20-50% by PCR). The model predicted that in very low transmission areas (<= 5%), three monthly rounds of MTAT with HS-RDT, starting towards the end of the dry season and testing 65 or 85% of the population for 2 consecutive years, would avert 62 or 78% of malaria cases (over 2years), respectively. The effect of the intervention would be lower in a moderate transmission setting. In all settings, MDA would be superior to MTAT with HS-RDT which would be superior to MTAT with conventional RDT.ConclusionThe HS-RDT's field sensitivity was modest and varied by transmission intensity. In low to very low transmission areas, three monthly rounds per year of MTAT with HS-RDT at 85% coverage for 2 consecutive years would reduce malaria prevalence to such low levels that additional strategies may achieve elimination. The model prediction would need to be confirmed by cluster-randomized trials.

TI A validation study of microscopy versus quantitative PCR for measuring
   Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Microscopy and 18S qPCR are the most common and field-friendly methods for quantifying malaria parasite density, and it is important that these methods can be interpreted as giving equivalent results. We compared results of quantitative measurement of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia by microscopy and by 18S qPCR in a phase 2a study. Microscopy positive samples (n = 355; median 810 parasites/mu L [IQR 40-10,471]) showed close agreement with 18S qPCR in mean log(10)/mL transformed parasitemia values by paired t test (difference 0.04, 95%CI - 0.01-0.10, p = 0.088). Excellent intraclass correlation (0.97) and no evidence of systematic or proportional differences by Passing-Bablok regression were observed. 18S qPCR appears to give equivalent parasitemia values to microscopy, which indicates 18S qPCR is an appropriate alternative method to quantify parasitemia in clinical trials.

TI A Balanced Proinflammatory and Regulatory Cytokine Signature in Young
   African Children Is Associated With Lower Risk of Clinical Malaria
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background The effect of timing of exposure to first Plasmodium falciparum infections during early childhood on the induction of innate and adaptive cytokine responses and their contribution to the development of clinical malaria immunity is not well established.
   Methods As part of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Mozambique using monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate to selectively control timing of malaria exposure during infancy, peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from participants at age 2.5, 5.5, 10.5, 15, and 24 months were stimulated ex vivo with parasite schizont and erythrocyte lysates. Cytokine messenger RNA expressed in cell pellets and proteins secreted in supernatants were quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and multiplex flow cytometry, respectively. Children were followed up for clinical malaria from birth until 4 years of age.
   Results Higher proinflammatory (interleukin [IL] 1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokine concentrations during the second year of life were associated with reduced incidence of clinical malaria up to 4 years of age, adjusting by chemoprophylaxis and prior malaria exposure. Significantly lower concentrations of antigen-specific T-helper 1 (IL-2, IL-12, interferon-gamma) and T-helper 2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines by 2 years of age were measured in children undergoing chemoprophylaxis compared to children receiving placebo (P < .03).
   Conclusions Selective chemoprophylaxis altering early natural exposure to malaria blood stage antigens during infancy had a significant effect on T-helper lymphocyte cytokine production >1 year later. Importantly, a balanced proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine signature, probably by innate cells, around age 2 years was associated with protective clinical immunity during childhood.

SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Drug efficacy trials monitor the continued efficacy of front-line drugs against falciparum malaria. Overestimating efficacy results in a country retaining a failing drug as first-line treatment with associated increases in morbidity and mortality, while underestimating drug effectiveness leads to removal of an effective treatment with substantial practical and economic implications. Trials are challenging: they require long durations of follow-up to detect drug failures, and patients are frequently reinfected during that period. Molecular correction based on parasite genotypes distinguishes reinfections from drug failures to ensure the accuracy of failure rate estimates. Several molecular correction "algorithms" have been proposed, but which is most accurate and/or robust remains unknown. We used pharmacological modeling to simulate parasite dynamics and genetic signals that occur in patients enrolled in malaria drug clinical trials. We compared estimates of treatment failure obtained from a selection of proposed molecular correction algorithms against the known "true" failure rate in the model. Our findings are as follows. (i) Molecular correction is essential to avoid substantial overestimates of drug failure rates. (ii) The current WHO-recommended algorithm consistently underestimates the true failure rate. (iii) Newly proposed algorithms produce more accurate failure rate estimates; the most accurate algorithm depends on the choice of drug, trial follow-up length, and transmission intensity. (iv) Long durations of patient follow-up may be counter-productive; large numbers of new infections accumulate and may be misclassified, overestimating drug failure rate. (v) Our model was highly consistent with existing in vivo data. The current WHO-recommended method for molecular correction and analysis of clinical trials should be reevaluated and updated.

TI Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing of the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease
   Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB We applied metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to detect Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) and other potential pathogens from whole-blood samples from 70 patients with suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever during a 2014 outbreak in Boende, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and correlated these findings with clinical symptoms. Twenty of 31 patients (64.5%) tested in Kinshasa, DRC, were EBOV positive by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Despite partial degradation of sample RNA during shipping and handling, mNGS followed by EBOV-specific capture probe enrichment in a U.S. genomics laboratory identified EBOV reads in 22 of 70 samples (31.4%) versus in 21 of 70 (30.0%) EBOV-positive samples by repeat qRT-PCR (overall concordance = 87.1%). Reads from Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) were detected in 21 patients, of which at least 9 (42.9%) were coinfected with EBOV. Other positive viral detections included hepatitis B virus (n = 2), human pegivirus 1 (n = 2), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 9), and Orungo virus (n = 1), a virus in the Reoviridae family. The patient with Orungo virus infection presented with an acute febrile illness and died rapidly from massive hemorrhage and dehydration. Although the patient's blood sample was negative by EBOV qRT-PCR testing, identification of viral reads by mNGS confirmed the presence of EBOV coinfection. In total, 9 new EBOV genomes (3 complete genomes, and an additional 6 >= 50% complete) were assembled. Relaxed molecular clock phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a molecular evolutionary rate for the Boende strain 4 to 10x slower than that of other Ebola lineages. These results demonstrate the utility of mNGS in broad-based pathogen detection and outbreak surveillance.

TI Assessing Performance of HRP2 Antigen Detection for Malaria Diagnosis in
   Mozambique
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that detect the Plasmodium falciparum specific histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) antigen are the primary methods for malaria diagnosis in Mozambique. However, these tests do not detect infections with non-falciparum malaria or Pfhrp2- and Pfhrp3-deleted P. falciparum parasites. To assess the appropriateness of conventional PfHRP2-only RDTs for malaria diagnosis in Mozambique, samples collected during a health facility survey conducted in three provinces of Mozambique were screened using antigen detection methods and further characterized by molecular techniques. Samples from 1,861 outpatients of all ages and symptoms attending 117 randomly selected public health facilities in 2018 were analyzed with an ultrasensitive bead-based immunoassay for the presence of PfHRP2, pan-Plasmodium aldolase (pAldo), and pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). The presence of PfHRP2 in patient blood detected using the bead-based assay was compared to the results of PfHRP2-based RDTs performed during the routine health facility consult and during the survey reexamination at the exit interview. Samples with discordant antigen profiles (negative for PfHRP2 but positive for pAldo and/or pLDH) were further characterized by photo induced electron transfer PCR (PET-PCR). Using the bead-based laboratory assay as the gold standard, the sensitivities of the conventional RDTs administered during the routine health facility consult and the exit interview were 90% and 83%, respectively, and the specificities were 91% and 97%, respectively. Of 710 samples positive for at least one antigen, 704 (99.2%) were positive for PfHRP2. Six (0.8% of total) discordant samples lacked PfHRP2 but were positive for pAldo and/or pLDH; 3 of these (0.4% of total) were Plasmodium ovale monoinfections or coinfections where P. ovale was the dominant species. The remaining 3 discordant samples were negative by PET-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the conventional RDTs performed in the routine health facility consults and survey exit interviews were acceptable, and there was no evidence of Pfhrp2- and Pfhrp3-deleted parasites. Monoinfections with nonfalciparum malaria species comprised <1% of the total malaria infections. Nearly all malaria antigen-positive patients had detectable PfHRP2, confirming that this antigen remains an appropriate malaria diagnostic target in the surveyed provinces.

TI Determinants of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment failure in
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam: a
   prospective clinical, pharmacological, and genetic study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background The emergence and spread of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria to artemisinin combination therapies in the Greater Mekong subregion poses a major threat to malaria control and elimination. The current study is part of a multi-country, open-label, randomised clinical trial (TRACII, 2015-18) evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of triple artemisinin combination therapies. A very high rate of treatment failure after treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was observed in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The immediate public health importance of our findings prompted us to report the efficacy data on dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and its determinants ahead of the results of the overall trial, which will be published later this year.
   Methods Patients aged between 2 and 65 years presenting with uncomplicated P falciparum or mixed species malaria at seven sites in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with or without mefloquine, as part of the TRACII trial. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected efficacy at day 42. Next-generation sequencing was used to assess the prevalence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance (kelch13 mutations, in particular Cys580Tyr) and piperaquine resistance (plasmepsin-2 and plasmepsin-3 amplifications and crt mutations). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453308.
   Findings Between Sept 28, 2015, and an 18, 2018, 539 patients with acute P falciparum malaria were screened for eligibility, 292 were enrolled, and 140 received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate of PCR-corrected efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at day 42 was 50.0% (95% CI 414-58.3). PCR-corrected efficacies for individual sites were 12.7% (2.2-33.0) in northeastern Thailand, 38.2% (15.9-60.5) in western Cambodia, 73.4% (57.0-84.3) in Ratanakiri (northeastern Cambodia), and 47.1% (33.5-59.6) in Binh Phuoc (southwestern Vietnam). Treatment failure was associated independently with plasmepsin2/3 amplification status and four mutations in the crt gene (Thr93Ser, His97Tyr, Phe145Ile, and Ile218Phe). Compared with the results of our previous TRACI trial in 2011-13, the prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (kelch13 Cys580Tyr mutations) and piperaquine resistance (plasmepsin2/3 amplifications and crt mutations) has increased substantially in the Greater Mekong subregion in the past decade.
   Interpretation Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is not treating malaria effectively across the eastern Greater Mekong subregion. A highly drug-resistant P falciparum co-lineage is evolving, acquiring new resistance mechanisms, and spreading. Accelerated elimination of P falciparum malaria in this region is needed urgently, to prevent further spread and avoid a potential global health emergency. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI Genetic Variations Associated with Drug Resistance Markers in
   Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Infections in Myanmar
SO GENES
AB The emergence and spread of drug resistance is a problem hindering malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. In this study, genetic variations in drug resistance markers of Plasmodium falciparum were determined in parasites from asymptomatic populations located in three geographically dispersed townships of Myanmar by PCR and sequencing. Mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr), dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (pfmrp1), and Kelch protein 13 (k13) were present in 92.3%, 97.6%, 84.0%, 98.8%, and 68.3% of the parasites, respectively. The pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y, pfmdr1 I185K, and pfmrp1 I876V mutations were present in 82.7%, 2.5%, 87.5%, and 59.8% isolates, respectively. The most prevalent haplotypes for pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfcrt and pfmdr1 were 51I/59R/108N/164L, 436A/437G/540E/581A, 74I/75E/76T/220S/271E/326N/356T/371I, and 86N/130E/184Y/185K/1225V, respectively. In addition, 57 isolates had three different point mutations (K191T, F446I, and P574L) and three types of N-terminal insertions (N, NN, NNN) in the k13 gene. In total, 43 distinct haplotypes potentially associated with multidrug resistance were identified. These findings demonstrate a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum in asymptomatic infections from diverse townships in Myanmar, emphasizing the importance of targeting asymptomatic infections to prevent the spread of drug-resistant P. falciparum.

TI Evaluation of the multiplex real-time PCR assays RealStar malaria S&T
   PCR kit 1.0 and FTD malaria differentiation for the differentiation of
   Plasmodium species in clinical samples
SO TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB Background: Two commercial PCR assays were assessed in a retrospective study to determine their reliability as tools for the differentiation of Plasmodium species in human blood.
   Methods: A total of 1022 blood samples from 817 patients with suspected or confirmed malaria submitted to the German National Reference Centre for Tropical Pathogens were subjected to malaria microscopy using thick and thin blood films as well as to a genus-specific malaria real-time PCR. Parasite-positive samples were analysed by RealStar Malaria S&T PCR Kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics) and FTD Malaria Differentiation (Fast Track Diagnostics) multiplex real-time PCR assays targeting species-specific Plasmodium DNA.
   Results: Out of the 1022 blood samples, 247 (24.2%) tested positive for Plasmodium spp. The two multiplex assays showed rather similar performance characteristics and provided concordant species information in 98.9% of samples positive by malaria microscopy and in 95.1% (RealStar) and 96.8% (FTD) of samples positive by genus-specific PCR. Compared to FTD, RealStar revealed slightly reduced sensitivity for submicroscopic, low-level P. falciparum infections, while FTD was unable to detect P. knowlesi.
   Conclusions: The two commercial malaria PCR assays assessed are suitable for discriminating Plasmodium species in clinical samples, and can provide additional information in cases of microscopically uncertain findings.

TI Infectivity and Screening of Anti-piperaquine Genes in Mice Infected
   with Piperaquine-Sensitive and Piperaquine-Resistant Plasmodium berghei
SO ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB Background Piperaquine (PQ) is one of the major components of artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria. However, the mechanism of PQ resistance has remained unclear. Methods In this study, we infected mice with PQ-resistant Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain line (PbPQR) or PQ-sensitive P. berghei ANKA strain line (PbPQS) and their survival rates, parasitemia, and spleen sizes were compared. In addition, we constructed genomic DNA subtractive library of spleens from the infected mice, and screened the potential PQ-resistant related genes from genomic DNA of PbPQR line using the representational difference analysis (RDA) method. Clones of the subtractive library were screened by PCR, and related genes were sequenced and analyzed using BLAST software of NCBI. Results Compared to PbPQS-infected mice, PbPQR-infected mice survived significantly longer, and had significantly lowered parasitemia rate and significantly increased splenomegaly. Among the total of 502 clones picked, 494 were sequenced and 96 unique PCR fragments were obtained; in which 24 DNA fragments were homologous to chromosomes related to immune function of mice. ORF Finder blasting showed that at the protein level, 26 encoded proteins were homologous to 18 hypothetical PbANKA proteins and 13 encoded proteins were homologous to "ferlin-like protein" family of PbANKA. In addition, there were more immune-related DNA molecules, ubiquitous PbANKA homology at the ORF fragment level, and enriched ferlin-like protein families identified from PbPQR-infected mice than those from PbPQS-infected mice. Conclusion These findings suggest that PbPQR may induce stronger protective immune response than that of PbPQS in infected mice.

TI Epidemiology and distribution of Plasmodium vivax malaria in Sudan
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax malaria has been recognised as an important cause of morbidity in several African countries. The prevalence was previously estimated as 2-5% in eastern Sudan. These estimates are observed to be rising and spreading continuously. The present study was undertaken to investigate the situation of distribution and epidemiology of P. vivax malaria in Sudan.
   Methods: Cross-sectional malaria surveys carried out in hospitals and health centres covered 21 sites in 10 states. Data and blood samples were collected from 1226 clinically investigated suspected malaria cases of both genders and all ages. Microscopically detected malaria parasites were confirmed by PCR.
   Results: The overall prevalence of P. vivax among the malaria cases was 26.6%. The prevalence showed significant variations between the states (p<0.001), which could be explained by differences in population movement, the presence of refugees and proximity to endemic neighbouring countries. It also varied significantly with residence status (p<0.001), reflecting the stability of transmission.
   Conclusion: Although malaria in Sudan is still largely attributed to Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax has been rising with worrying proportions and spreading to new areas. The emergence and marked increase of P. vivax poses new challenges to malaria treatment and control in Sudan.

TI Atovaquone-Proguanil in Combination With Artesunate to Treat
   Multidrug-Resistant P. falciparum Malaria in Cambodia: An Open-Label
   Randomized Trial
SO OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Recent artemisinin-combination therapy failures in Cambodia prompted a search for alternatives. Atovaquone-proguanil (AP), a safe, effective treatment for multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.), previously demonstrated additive effects in combination with artesunate (AS).
   Methods. Patients with P.f. or mixed-species infection (n = 205) in Anlong Veng (AV; n = 157) and Kratie (KT; n = 48), Cambodia, were randomized open-label 1:1 to a fixed-dose 3-day AP regimen +/-3 days of co-administered artesunate (ASAP). Single low-dose primaquine (PQ 15 mg) was given on day 1 to prevent gametocyte-mediated transmission.
   Results. Polymerase chain reaction-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response at 42 days was 90% for AP (95% confidence interval [CI], 82%-95%) and 92% for ASAP (95% CI, 83%-96%; P = .73). The median parasite clearance time was 72 hours for ASAP in AV vs 56 hours in KT (P < .001) and was no different than AP alone. At 1 week postprimaquine, 7% of the ASAP group carried microscopic gametocytes vs 29% for AP alone (P = .0001). Nearly all P.f. isolates had C580Y K13 propeller artemisinin resistance mutations (AV 99%; KT 88%). Only 1 of 14 treatment failures carried the cytochrome bcl (Pfcytb) atovaquone resistance mutation, which was not present at baseline. P.f. isolates remained atovaquone sensitive in vitro but cycloguanil resistant, with a triple P.f. dihydrofolate reductase mutation.
   Conclusions. Atovaquone-proguanil remained marginally effective in Cambodia (90%) with minimal Pfcytb mutations observed. Treatment failures in the presence of ex vivo atovaquone sensitivity and adequate plasma levels may be attributable to cycloguanil and/or artemisinin resistance. Artesunate co-administration provided little additional blood-stage efficacy but reduced post-treatment gametocyte carriage in combination with AP beyond single low-dose primaquine.

TI Genetic polymorphism of Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (msp1) and 2 (msp2)
   genes and multiplicity of Plasmodium falciparum infection across various
   endemic areas in Senegal
SO AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES
AB Introduction: Despite a significant decline in Senegal, malaria remains a burden in various parts of the country. Assessment of multiplicity of Plasmodium falciparum infection and genetic diversity of parasites population could help in monitoring of malaria control.
   Objective: To assess genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection in P. falciparum isolates from three areas in Senegal with different malaria transmissions.
   Methods: 136 blood samples were collected from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Pikine, Kedougou and Thies. Polymorphic loci of msp1 and 2 (Merozoite surface protein-1 and 2) genes were amplified by nested PCR.
   Results: For msp1gene, K1 allelic family was predominant with frequency of 71%. Concerning msp2 gene, IC3D7 allelic family was the most represented with frequency of 83%. Multiclonal isolates found were 36% and 31% for msp1et msp2 genes respectively. The MOI found in all areas was 2.56 and was statistically different between areas (P=0.024). Low to intermediate genetic diversity were found with heterozygosity range (He=0,394-0,637) and low genetic differentiation (Fst msp1= 0.011; Fst msp2= 0.017) were observed between P. falciparum population within the country.
   Conclusion: Low to moderate genetic diversity of P.falciparum strains and MOI disparities were found in Senegal.

TI Microscopic and submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infection, maternal
   anaemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Papua New Guinea: a cohort
   study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundInfection during pregnancy with Plasmodium falciparum is associated with maternal anaemia and adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight (LBW). Studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques indicate that at least half of all infections in maternal venous blood are missed by light microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. The impact of these subpatent infections on maternal and birth outcomes remains unclear.MethodsIn a cohort of women co-enrolled in a clinical trial of intermittent treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus azithromycin for the prevention of LBW (<2500g) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), P. falciparum infection status at antenatal enrolment and delivery was assessed by routine light microscopy and real-time quantitative PCR. The impact of infection status at enrolment and delivery on adverse birth outcomes and maternal haemoglobin at delivery was assessed using logistic and linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders. Together with insecticide-treated bed nets, women had received up to 3monthly intermittent preventive treatments with SP plus azithromycin or a single clearance treatment with SP plus chloroquine.ResultsA total of 9.8% (214/2190) of women had P. falciparum (mono-infection or mixed infection with Plasmodium vivax) detected in venous blood at antenatal enrolment at 14-26weeks' gestation. 4.7% of women had microscopic, and 5.1% submicroscopic P. falciparum infection. At delivery (n=1936), 1.5% and 2.0% of women had submicroscopic and microscopic P. falciparum detected in peripheral blood, respectively. Submicroscopic P. falciparum infections at enrolment or at delivery in peripheral or placental blood were not associated with maternal anaemia or adverse birth outcomes such as LBW. Microscopic P. falciparum infection at antenatal enrolment was associated with anaemia at delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 3.67; P=0.025). Peripheral microscopic P. falciparum infection at delivery was associated with LBW (aOR 2.75, 95% CI 1.27; 5.94, P=0.010) and preterm birth (aOR 6.58, 95% CI 2.46, 17.62; P<0.001).ConclusionsA substantial proportion of P. falciparum infections in pregnant women in PNG were submicroscopic. Microscopic, but not submicroscopic, infections were associated with adverse outcomes in women receiving malaria preventive treatment and insecticide-treated bed nets. Current malaria prevention policies that combine insecticide-treated bed nets, intermittent preventive treatment and prompt treatment of symptomatic infections appear to be appropriate for the management of malaria in pregnancy in settings like PNG.

TI K-13 propeller gene polymorphisms isolated between 2014 and 2017 from
   Cameroonian Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients
SO PLOS ONE
AB The emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites since the late 2000s at the border of Cambodia and Thailand poses serious threats to malaria control globally, particularly in Africa which bears the highest malaria transmission burden. This study aimed to obtain reliable data on the current state of the kelch13 molecular marker for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. DNA was extracted from the dried blood spots collected from epidemiologically distinct endemic areas in the Center, Littoral and North regions of Cameroon. Nested PCR products from the Kelch13-propeller gene were sequenced and analyzed on an ABI 3730XL automatic sequencer. Of 219 dried blood spots, 175 were sequenced successfully. We identified six K13 mutations in 2.9% (5/175) of samples, including 2 non-synonymous, the V589I allele had been reported in Africa already and one new allele E612K had not been reported yet. These two non-synonymous mutations were uniquely found in parasites from the Littoral region. One sample showed two synonymous mutations within the kelch13 gene. We also observed two infected samples with mixed K13 mutant and K13 wild-type infection. Taken together, our data suggested the circulation of the non-synonymous K13 mutations in Cameroon. Albeit no mutations known to be associated with parasite clearance delays in the study population, there is need for continuous surveillance for earlier detection of resistance as long as ACTs are used and scaled up in the community.

TI A multiplex qPCR approach for detection of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene
   deletions in multiple strain infections of Plasmodium falciparum
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid and accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection is an essential factor in malaria control. Currently, malaria diagnosis in the field depends heavily on using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) many of which detect circulating parasite-derived histidine-rich protein 2 antigen (PfHRP2) in capillary blood. P. falciparum strains lacking PfHRP2, due to pfhrp2 gene deletions, are an emerging threat to malaria control programs. The novel assay described here, named qHRP2/3-del, is well suited for high-throughput screening of P. falciparum isolates to identify these gene deletions. The qHRP2/3-del assay identified pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion status correctly in 93.4% of samples with parasitemia levels higher than 5 parasites/mu L when compared to nested PCR. The qHRP2/3-del assay can correctly identify pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in multiple strain co-infections, particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan countries. Deployment of this qHRP2/3-del assay will provide rapid insight into the prevalence and potential spread of P. falciparum isolates that escape surveillance by RDTs.

TI Prevalence and Epidemiological Characteristics of Asymptomatic Malaria
   Based on Ultrasensitive Diagnostics: A Cross-sectional Study
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. As the global public-health objectives for malaria evolve from malaria control towards malaria elimination, there is increasing interest in the significance of asymptomatic infections and the optimal diagnostic test to identify them.
   Method. We conducted a cross-sectional study of asymptomatic individuals (N = 562) to determine the epidemiological characteristics associated with asymptomatic malaria. Participants were tested by rapid diagnostic tests (CareStart, Standard Diagnostics [SD] Bioline, and Alere ultrasensitive RDT [uRDT]), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine malaria positivity. Hemoglobin values were recorded, and anemia was defined as a binary variable, according to World Health Organization guidelines.
   Results. Compared to reference qRT-PCR, LAMP had the highest sensitivity (92.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 86.4-96.5), followed by uRDT Alere Malaria (33.9%, 95% CI 25.5-43.1), CareStart Malaria (14.1%, 95% CI 8.4-21.5), microscopy (5.0%, 95% CI 1.8-10.5), and SD Bioline (5.0%, 95% CI 1.8-10.5). For Plasmodium falciparum specimens only, the sensitivity for uRDT Alere Malaria was 50.0% (95% CI 38.8-61.3) and SD Bioline was 7.3% (95% CI 2.7-15.3). Based on multivariate regression analysis with qRT-PCR as the gold standard, for every 3.2% increase in the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria, hemoglobin decreased by 1 gram per deciliter (prevalence ratio 0.968, 95% CI 0.940-0.997; P = .032). Deletions (4.8%) in hrp2 were noted.
   Conclusions. While uRDT Alere Malaria has superior sensitivity to rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy in detecting asymptomatic malaria, LAMP is superior still. Ultrasensitive diagnostics provide the accurate prevalence estimates of asymptomatic malaria required for elimination.

TI Plasmodium vivax cerebral malaria in an adult patient in Sudan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax infection is rising in sub-Saharan Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for more than 90% of malaria cases. While P. vivax is identified as a major cause of severe and cerebral malaria in South east Asia, the Pacific and South America, most of the severe and cerebral cases in Africa were attributed to P. falciparum. Cases of severe malaria due to P. vivax are emerging in Africa. A few severe P. vivax cases were reported in Eastern Sudan and they were underestimated due to the lack of accurate diagnosis, low parasitaemia and seldom use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
   Case presentation: A 60-year-old Sudanese male presented to the Al Kuwaiti hospital in the Sudan capital Khartoum. On admission, the patient was complaining of fever (measured temperature was 38 degrees C), sweating, chills, vomiting and confusion in the past 2 days prior to his admission. He rapidly deteriorated into a coma state within 48 h of the admission, with significant neck stiffness. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and was suspected of meningitis. Lumbar puncture was not performed since the patient was suffering from spinal cord disc. Brain CT scan was unremarkable. Several biochemical, haematological tests, and blood film for malaria were performed. The results of the laboratory tests were within the normal range except of mild elevation of the total white blood cell count and a significant decrease in the platelets count. Malaria parasites were seen in the blood film with high parasitaemia (quantified as 3 +++). The patient was diagnosed as P. vivax cerebral malaria based on the positive blood film and the amplification of P. vivax specific 499 bp amplicon using Plasmodium multi-species multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The patient was treated with quinine 10 mg/kg body weight for 10 days followed by primaquine 15 mg/days PO for 2 weeks. The symptoms subsided within 48 h and the patients was cured and released from the hospital.
   Conclusions: Plasmodium vivax is an emerging cause of cerebral malaria in adults in Sudan and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cerebral malaria for proper management of patients.

TI Natural selection and genetic diversity of domain I of Plasmodium
   falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 on Bioko Island
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) is a promising candidate antigen for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. However, antigenic variation and diversity of PfAMA-1 are still major problems to design a universal malaria vaccine based on this antigen, especially against domain I (DI). Detail understanding of the PfAMA-1 gene polymorphism can provide useful information on this potential vaccine component. Here, general characteristics of genetic structure and the effect of natural selection of DIs among Bioko P. falciparum isolates were analysed.
   Methods: 214 blood samples were collected from Bioko Island patients with P. falciparum malaria between 2011 and 2017. A fragment spanning DI of PfAMA-1 was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Polymorphic characteristics and the effect of natural selection were analysed using MEGA 5.0, DnaSP 6.0 and Popart programs. Genetic diversity in 576 global PfAMA-1 DIs were also analysed. Protein function prediction of new amino acid mutation sites was performed using PolyPhen-2 program.
   Results: 131 different haplotypes of PfAMA-1 were identified in 214 Bioko Island P. falciparum isolates. Most amino acid changes identified on Bioko Island were found in C1L. 32 amino acid changes identified in PfAMA-1 sequences from Bioko Island were found in predicted RBC-binding sites, B cell epitopes or IUR regions. Overall patterns of amino acid changes of Bioko PfAMA-1 DIs were similar to those in global PfAMA-1 isolates. Differential amino acid substitution frequencies were observed for samples from different geographical regions. Eight new amino acid changes of Bioko island isolates were also identified and their three-dimensional protein structural consequences were predicted. Evidence for natural selection and recombination event were observed in global isolates.
   Conclusions: Patterns of nucleotide diversity and amino acid polymorphisms of Bioko Island isolates were similar to those of global PfAMA-1 DIs. Balancing natural selection across DIs might play a major role in generating genetic diversity in global isolates. Most amino acid changes in DIs occurred in predicted B-cell epitopes. Novel sites mapped on a three dimensional structure of PfAMA-1 showed that these regions were located at the corner. These results may provide significant value in the design of a malaria vaccine based on this antigen.

TI Molecular Surveillance of Drug Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum
   Isolates Imported from Angola in Henan Province, China
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Angola was the main origin country for the imported malaria in Henan Province, China. Antimalarial drug resistance has posed a threat to the control and elimination of malaria. Several molecular markers were confirmed to be associated with the antimalarial drug resistance, such as pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, and K13. This study evaluated the drug resistance of the 180 imported Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Angola via nested PCR using Sanger sequencing. The prevalences of pfcrt C72V73M74N75K76, pfmdr1 N86Y184S1034N1042D1246, pfdhfr A(16)N(51)C(59)S(108)D(139)I(164), and pfdhps S(436)A(437)A(476)K(540)A(581) were 69.4%, 59.9%, 1.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Three nonsynonymous (A5785, M579I, and Q613E) and one synonymous (R471R) mutation of K13 were found, the prevalences of which were 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps were generally shown as multiple mutations. The mutant prevalence of pfcrt reduced gradually, but pfdhfr and pfdhps still showed high mutant prevalence, while pfmdr1 was relatively low. The mutation of the K13 gene was rare. Molecular surveillance of artemisinin (ART) resistance will be used as a tool to evaluate the real-time efficacy of the artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and the ART resistance situation.

TI Molecular characterization of surface antigen 10 of Eimeria tenella
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Chicken coccidiosis is caused by the apicomplexan parasite Eimeria spp. At present, drug resistance of Eimeria is common because of the indiscriminate use of anticoccidial drugs. The gene encoding surface antigen 10 of Eimeria tenella (EtSAG10) is differentially expressed between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains. RNA-seq analysis indicated that this gene was downregulated in strains resistant to maduramicin and diclazuril compared to susceptible strains. EtSAG10 DNA sequence alignment revealed that they contained one and ten mutations in MRR and DZR, compared with DS, respectively. A full-length EtSAG10 cDNA was successfully cloned and expressed, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared. The transcription and translation levels of EtSAG10 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. The localization of EtSAG10 in Spz, Mrz, and parasites in the first asexual stage was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The potential association of EtSAG10 with sporozoite invasion of host cells was assessed by invasion inhibition assays. The results showed that EtSAG10 had a predicted transmembrane domain at the C-terminal end and a predicted signal peptide at the N-terminal end. EtSAG10 was downregulated in drug-resistant strains, which is consistent with the RNA-seq results. The EtSAG10 protein was localized to the parasite surface and parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This protein was shown to play a role in the infection of chicken intestine by sporozoites.

TI Genetic polymorphism of the N-terminal region in circumsporozoite
   surface protein of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Sudan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite is still known to be one of the most significant public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Genetic diversity of the Sudanese P. falciparum based on the diversity in the circumsporozoite surface protein (PfCSP) has not been previously studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of the N-terminal region of the pfcsp gene. Methods A cross-sectional molecular study was conducted; 50 blood samples have been analysed from different regions in Sudan. Patients were recruited from the health facilities of Khartoum, New Halfa, Red Sea, White Nile, Al Qadarif, Gezira, River Nile, and Ad Damazin during malaria transmission seasons between June to October and December to February 2017-2018. Microscopic and nested PCR was performed for detection of P. falciparum. Merozoite surface protein-1 was performed to differentiate single and multiple clonal infections. The N-terminal of the pfcsp gene has been sequenced using PCR-Sanger dideoxy method and analysed to sequences polymorphism including the numbers of haplotypes (H), segregating sites (S), haplotypes diversity (Hd) and the average number of nucleotide differences between two sequences (Pi) were obtained using the software DnaSP v5.10. As well as neutrality testing, Tajima's D test, Fu and Li's D and F statistics. Results PCR amplification resulted in 1200 bp of the pfcsp gene. Only 21 PCR products were successfully sequenced while 29 were presenting multiple clonal P. falciparum parasite were not sequenced. The analysis of the N-terminal region of the PfCSP amino acids sequence compared to the reference strains showed five different haplotypes. H1 consisted of 3D7, NF54, HB3 and 13 isolates of the Sudanese pfcsp. H2 comprised of 7G8, Dd2, MAD20, RO33, Wellcome strain, and 5 isolates of the Sudanese pfcsp. H3, H4, and H5 were found in 3 distinct isolates. Hd was 0.594 +/- 0.065, and S was 12. The most common polymorphic site was A98G; other sites were D82Y, N83H, N83M, K85L, L86F, R87L, R87F, and A98S. Fu and Li's D* test value was - 2.70818, Fu and Li's F* test value was - 2.83907, indicating a role of negative balancing selection in the pfcsp N-terminal region. Analysis with the global pfcsp N-terminal regions showed the presence of 13 haplotypes. Haplotypes frequencies were 79.4%, 17.0%, 1.6% and 1.0% for H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively. Remaining haplotypes frequency was 0.1% for each. Hd was 0.340 +/- 0.017 with a Pi of 0.00485, S was 18 sites, and Pi was 0.00030. Amino acid polymorphisms identified in the N-terminal region of global pfcsp were present at eight positions (D82Y, N83H/M, K85L/T/N, L86F, R87L/F, A98G/V/S, D99G, and G100D). Conclusions Sudanese pfcsp N-terminal region was well-conserved with only a few polymorphic sites. Geographical distribution of genetic diversity showed high similarity to the African isolates, and this will help and contribute in the deployment of RTS,S, a PfCSP-based vaccine, in Sudan.

TI Genetic Diversity of Plasmodium vivax in Clinical Isolates from Southern
   Thailand using PvMSP1, PvMSP3 (PvMSP3 alpha, PvMSP3 beta) Genes and
   Eight Microsatellite Markers
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Plasmodium vivax is usually considered morbidity in endemic areas of Asia, Central and South America, and some part of Africa In Thailand, previous studies indicated the genetic diversity of P. vivax in malaria-endemic regions such as the westen part of Thailand bordering with Myanmar. The objective of the study is to investigate the genetic diversity of P. vivax circulating in Southern Thailand by using 3 antigenic markers and 8 microsatellite markers. Dried blood spots were collected from Chumphon, Phang Nga, Ranong and, Surat Thani provinces of Thailand. By PCR, 3 distinct sizes of PvMSP3 alpha, 2 sizes of PvMSP3 beta and 2 sizes of PvMSP1 F2 were detected based on the length of PCR products, respectively. PCR/RFLP analyses of these antigen genes revealed high levels of genetic diversity. The genotyping of 8 microsatellite loci showed high genetic diversity as indicated by high alleles per locus and high expected heterozygosity (H-E). The genotyping markers also showed multiple-clones of infection. Mixed genotypes were detected in 4.8% of PvMSP3 alpha, 29.1% in PvMSP3 beta and 55.3% of microsatellite markers. These results showed that there was high genetic diversity of P. vivax isolated from Southern Thailand, indicating that the genetic diversity of P. vivax in this region was comparable to those observed other areas of Thailand.

TI Early malaria infection, dysregulation of angiogenesis, metabolism and
   inflammation across pregnancy, and risk of preterm birth in Malawi: A
   cohort study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Malaria infection during pregnancy has serious consequences for the mother and her unborn child. We have a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which malaria causes adverse birth outcomes, especially preterm birth (PTB), a leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age. Efforts to date to prevent malaria in pregnant women have not been shown to reduce the risk of PTB associated with malaria infection. We conducted this study to assess if malaria infection, especially early in pregnancy, might alter important factors that control placental growth and function and determine if these lead to PTB. What did the researchers do and find? We measured levels of 10 different angiogenic, inflammatory, and/or metabolic proteins longitudinally during pregnancy in a large cohort of 1,628 Malawian women at risk of malaria infection and demonstrate that early infection with malaria is associated with changes in several key proteins that are important for healthy pregnancies. The use of ultrasound dating highlighted the contribution of early malaria infection to an increased risk of delivering preterm, previously thought to occur primarily from malaria late in pregnancy. What do these findings mean? Current interventions to prevent malaria in pregnancy are usually initiated at the first antenatal visit in the second trimester. This study demonstrates that many women are already malaria-infected at this first visit and that these early infections are sufficient to alter factors essential for the placenta to adequately support fetal growth and healthy pregnancy outcomes. These early infections increase the risk of delivering preterm, indicating that interventions to prevent malaria in pregnancy may need to be started earlier in pregnancy in order to reduce malaria-associated adverse birth outcomes.
   Background Malaria in pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Tight regulation of angiogenic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways are essential for healthy pregnancies. We hypothesized that malaria disrupts these pathways leading to preterm birth (PTB). Methods and findings We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of malaria prevention in pregnancy conducted in Malawi from July 21, 2011, to March 18, 2013. We longitudinally assessed circulating mediators of angiogenic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways during pregnancy in a cohort of HIV-negative women (n = 1,628), with a median age of 21 years [18, 25], and 562 (35%) were primigravid. Pregnancies were ultrasound dated, and samples were analyzed at 13 to 23 weeks (Visit 1), 28 to 33 weeks (Visit 2), and/or 34 to 36 weeks (Visit 3). Malaria prevalence was high; 70% (n = 1,138) had PCR-positive Plasmodium falciparum infection at least once over the course of pregnancy and/or positive placental histology. The risk of delivering preterm in the entire cohort was 20% (n = 304/1506). Women with malaria before 24 weeks gestation had a higher risk of PTB (24% versus 18%, p = 0.005; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.63, p = 0.021); and those who were malaria positive only before week 24 had an even greater risk of PTB (28% versus 17%, p = 0.02; with an aRR of 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.30, p = 0.002). Using linear mixed-effects modeling, malaria before 24 weeks gestation was associated with altered kinetics of inflammatory (C-Reactive Protein [CRP], Chitinase 3-like protein-1 [CHI3L1], Interleukin 18 Binding Protein [IL-18BP], soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor II [sTNFRII], soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 [sICAM-1]), angiogenic (soluble Endoglin [sEng]), and metabolic mediators (Leptin, Angiopoietin-like 3 [Angptl3]) over the course of pregnancy (chi(2) > 13.0, p <= 0.001 for each). Limitations include being underpowered to assess the impact on nonviable births, being unable to assess women who had not received any antimalarials, and, because of the exposure to antimalarials in the second trimester, there were limited numbers of malaria infections late in pregnancy. Conclusions Current interventions for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy are initiated at the first antenatal visit, usually in the second trimester. In this study, we found that many women are already malaria-infected by their first visit. Malaria infection before 24 weeks gestation was associated with dysregulation of essential regulators of angiogenesis, metabolism, and inflammation and an increased risk of PTB. Preventing malaria earlier in pregnancy may reduce placental dysfunction and thereby improve birth outcomes in malaria-endemic settings.

TI RhopH3, rhoptry gene conserved in the free-living alveolate flagellate
   Colpodella sp. (Apicomplexa)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY
AB In this study, we investigated morphological, immunological and molecular characteristics of Colpodella sp. (American 'Type Culture Collection 50594) in a diprotist culture containing Bodo caudalus as prey using Plasmodium rhoptry specific antibodies and oligonucleotide primers targeting Plasmodium falciparum rhoptry genes. In culture, Colpodella sp, attached to its prey using the apical end with attachment lasting for approximately 20 min while the cytoplasmic contents of the prey were aspirated into the posterior food vacuole of Colpodella sp. Encystment of Colpodella sp, was observed following feeding, Indirect immunotluorescence assay (IFA) and confocal microscopy using P falciparum rhoptry specific antibodies showed intense reactivity with cytoplasmic vesicles of Colpodella sp. Bodo caudatus from diprotist and monoprotist (ATCC 30395) cultures showed weak background reactivity. Giemsa staining permitted differentiation of both protists. Genomic DNA isolated from the diprotist culture was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers targeting the P.falciparton rhoptry genes RhopH3, RhopIll/Clag3.2 and RAMA. Primers targeting exon 7 of the P falciparum RhopH3 gene amplified an approximately 2 kb DNA fragment from the diprotist DNA template. DNA sequence and BLAST search analysis of the amplified product from diprotist DNA identified the RhopH3 gene demonstrating that the RhopH3 gene is conserved in Colpodella sp. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

TI DNA recovery from archived RDTs for genetic characterization of
   Plasmodium falciparum in a routine setting in Lambarene, Gabon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been described as a source of genetic material to analyse malaria parasites in proof-of-concept studies. The increasing use of RDTs (e.g., in focal or mass screening and treatment campaigns) makes this approach particularly attractive for large-scale investigations of parasite populations. In this study, the complexity of Plasmodium falciparum infections, parasite load and chloroquine resistance transporter gene mutations were investigated in DNA samples extracted from positive RDTs, obtained in a routine setting and archived at ambient temperature.
   Methods: A total of 669 archived RDTs collected from malaria cases in urban, semi-urban and rural areas of central Gabon were used for P. falciparum DNA extraction. Performance of RDTs as a source of DNA for PCR was determined using: (i) amplification of a single copy merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) gene followed by highly sensitive and automated capillary electrophoresis; (ii) genotyping of the pfcrt gene locus 72-76 using haplotype-specific-probe-based real-time PCR to characterize chloroquine resistance; and, (iii) real-time PCR targeting 18S genes to detect and quantify Plasmodium parasites.
   Results: Out of the 669 archived RDTs, amplification of P. falciparum nucleic materials had a success rate of 97% for 18S real-time PCR, and 88% for the msp1 gene. The multiplicity of infections (MOI) of the whole population was 2.6 (95% CI 2.5-2.8). The highest number of alleles detected in one infection was 11. The MOI decreased with increasing age (beta = -0.0046, p = 0.02) and residence in Lambarene was associated with smaller MOIs (p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of mutations associated with chloroquine resistance was 78.5% and was not associated with age. In Lambarene, prevalence of chloroquine resistance was lower compared to rural Moyen-Ogooue (beta = -0.809, p-value = 0.011).
   Conclusion: RDT is a reliable source of DNA for P. falciparum detection and genotyping assays. Furthermore, the increasing use of RDTs allows them to be an alternative source of DNA for large-scale genetic epidemiological studies. Parasite populations in the study area are highly diverse and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum remains high, especially in rural areas.

TI Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes in parasite
   isolates from asymptomatic individuals in Southeast Nigeria 11 years
   after withdrawal of chloroquine
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background A reversal of chloroquine (CQ) resistance following a period of withdrawal has raised the possibility of its re-introduction. This study evaluated the current prevalence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles in Plasmodium falciparum isolates, 11 years after CQ withdrawal in Southeast Nigeria. Methods Filter-paper blood samples were collected from 725 non-febrile individuals, comprising 250 children (<= 12 years), 250 pregnant women and 225 other adults, between October 2014 and February 2015 in Nnewi town, Southeast Nigeria. Nested PCR followed by direct sequencing was employed for the genotyping of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes. Results A total of 103 parasites-positive samples were recovered, comprising of 48 (19.20%) among children, 20 (20.00%) among pregnant women and 35 (15.50%) among other adults cohort. The frequency of the mutant genotype of Pfcrt 76T, 75E and 74I was 94.50% each. Parasite isolates from children had a frequency of 100% for mutant alleles in all Pfcrt codons while isolates from pregnant women and other adults had a frequency of 91% each in all codons. Haplotype distribution of pfcrt gene were 5.45, 0.00 and 76.37% for CVMNK, SVMNT and CVIET, respectively. For Pfmdr1 gene, the frequency of 86Y, 184F and 1246Y mutant alleles were 8.54, 29.27 and 3.66%, respectively. Amongst the Pfmdr1 haplotypes analysed, NFD had the highest frequency of 24.4%, followed by YFD at 6.10%. NYF and NYY occurred the least (1.20%). Conclusion The high level of Pfcrt mutations is suggestive of a sustained CQ pressure on P. falciparum isolates in the study area, despite the change of first line treatment from CQ to artemisinin combination therapy for 11 years. A new strategy to ensure the complete withdrawal of CQ from the country is recommended.

TI Detection of malaria parasites in dried human blood spots using
   mid-infrared spectroscopy and logistic regression analysis
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Epidemiological surveys of malaria currently rely on microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test kits for Plasmodium infections (RDTs). This study investigated whether mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots. Methods Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in 12 wards in southeastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range 4000 cm(-1) to 500 cm(-1). The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapour and CO2 interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test-stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting Plasmodium falciparum positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS. Results Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting P. falciparum infections (specificity = 91.7%; sensitivity = 92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of P. falciparum and Plasmodium ovale (specificity = 85%, sensitivity = 85%) in the field-collected specimen. Conclusion These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in human DBS. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of Plasmodium in both non-clinical settings (e.g., field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, before the approach can be used, we need additional field validation in other study sites with different parasite populations, and in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the MIR signals. Improving the classification algorithms, and model training on larger datasets could also improve specificity and sensitivity. The MIR-ML spectroscopy system is physically robust, low-cost, and requires minimum maintenance.

TI Utility of qSOFA and modified SOFA in severe malaria presenting as
   sepsis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Sepsis can be caused by malaria infection, but little is known about the utility of the quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and SOFA score in malaria. We conducted a prospective observational study from March 2013 to February 2017 to examine adults admitted with community-acquired infection in a tertiary-care hospital in Ubon Ratchathani, Northeast Thailand (Ubon-sepsis). Subjects were classified as having sepsis if they had a modified SOFA score >= 2 within 24 hours of admission. Serum was stored and later tested for malaria parasites using a nested PCR assay. Presence of severe malaria was defined using modified World Health Organization criteria. Of 4,989 patients enrolled, 153 patients (3%) were PCR positive for either Plasmodium falciparum (74 [48%]), P. vivax (69 [45%]), or both organisms (10 [7%]). Of 153 malaria patients, 80 were severe malaria patients presenting with sepsis, 70 were non-severe malaria patients presenting with sepsis, and three were non-severe malaria patients presenting without sepsis. The modified SOFA score (median 5; IQR 4-6; range 1-18) was strongly correlated with malaria severity determined by the number of World Health Organization severity criteria satisfied by the patient (Spearman's rho = 0.61, p<0.001). Of 80 severe malaria patients, 2 (2.5%), 11 (14%), 62 (77.5%) and 5 (6%), presented with qSOFA scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Twenty eight-day mortality was 1.3% (2/153). In conclusion, qSOFA and SOFA can serve as markers of disease severity in adults with malarial sepsis. Patients presenting with a qSOFA score of 1 may also require careful evaluation for sepsis; including diagnosis of cause of infection, initiation of medical intervention, and consideration for referral as appropriate.

TI Infrared spectroscopy coupled to cloud-based data management as a tool
   to diagnose malaria: a pilot study in a malaria-endemic country
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Widespread elimination of malaria requires an ultra-sensitive detection method that can detect low parasitaemia levels seen in asymptomatic carriers who act as reservoirs for further transmission of the disease, but is inexpensive and easy to deploy in the field in low income settings. It was hypothesized that a new method of malaria detection based on infrared spectroscopy, shown in the laboratory to have similar sensitivity to PCR based detection, could prove effective in detecting malaria in a field setting using cheap portable units with data management systems allowing them to be used by users inexpert in spectroscopy. This study was designed to determine whether the methodology developed in the laboratory could be translated to the field to diagnose the presence of Plasmodium in the blood of patients presenting at hospital with symptoms of malaria, as a precursor to trials testing the sensitivity of to detect asymptomatic carriers. Methods The field study tested 318 patients presenting with suspected malaria at four regional clinics in Thailand. Two portable infrared spectrometers were employed, operated from a laptop computer or a mobile telephone with in-built software that guided the user through the simple measurement steps. Diagnostic modelling and validation testing using linear and machine learning approaches was performed against the gold standard qPCR. Sample spectra from 318 patients were used for building calibration models (112 positive and 110 negative samples according to PCR testing) and independent validation testing (39 positive and 57 negatives samples by PCR). Results The machine learning classification (support vector machines; SVM) performed with 92% sensitivity (3 false negatives) and 97% specificity (2 false positives). The Area Under the Receiver Operation Curve (AUROC) for the SVM classification was 0.98. These results may be better than as stated as one of the spectroscopy false positives was infected by a Plasmodium species other than Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax, not detected by the PCR primers employed. Conclusions In conclusion, it was demonstrated that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy could be used as an efficient and reliable malaria diagnostic tool and has the potential to be developed for use at point of care under tropical field conditions with spectra able to be analysed via a Cloud-based system, and the diagnostic results returned to the user's mobile telephone or computer. The combination of accessibility to mass screening, high sensitivity and selectivity, low logistics requirements and portability, makes this new approach a potentially outstanding tool in the context of malaria elimination programmes. The next step in the experimental programme now underway is to reduce the sample requirements to fingerprick volumes.

TI K13-propeller gene polymorphisms of Plasmodium falciparum and the
   therapeutic effect of artesunate among migrant workers returning to
   Guangxi, China (2014-2017)
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin has been identified in Asia and some parts of Africa. The drug resistance of P. falciparum will be an obstacle to the successful elimination of malaria by 2025. Whole-genome sequencing of the artemisinin-resistant parasite line revealed mutations on the k13 gene associated with drug resistance in P. falciparum. To understand the artemisinin resistance of the imported P. falciparum cases from Africa, the mutations in the k13 gene in parasites from imported malaria cases in Guangxi Province were detected and the treatment efficiency of artesunate monotherapy was observed. Methods DNA was extracted from 319 blood samples from migrant workers with P. falciparum infection who returned to their hometown in Guangxi Province from Africa between 2014 and 2017. The k13-propeller gene was amplified by nested PCR, and sequencing, gene mutation frequency and geographic difference of imported P. falciparum cases were analysed by comparison with the wild-type strain. Of 319 patients, 158 were P. falciparum-infected and were treated with intravenous injection of artesunate and were observed, including the time of asexual stage clearance and the dose of artesunate used. Results Of the 319 P. falciparum samples, 12 samples had the k13-propeller mutation, and 11 point mutations were detected; 5 were non-synonymous mutations (T474I, A481T, A578S, V603E, G665S) and were not associated with artemisinin resistance. The clinical treatment observation showed that the median (IQR) dose of artesunate for peripheral blood parasite asexual stage clearance was 407.55 (360-510) mg, and the D3 parasite clearance rate was 70.25%, including the five k13-propeller mutations of P. falciparum. After 7 days of treatment, 98.73% of cases were cleared. Two cases were treated with artemisinin for 8 days with a 960-mg dose to completely clear the asexual parasite, but they did not have a mutation in the k13 gene. Conclusions Five mutations of the k13-propeller gene in 319 P. falciparum samples from patients returning from Africa were identified. The frequency of the k13-propeller mutants was low, and the mutations were not strongly associated with artemisinin resistance. The median (IQR) dose of artesunate monotherapy in actual clinical treatment to remove asexual parasite stages was 407.55 (360-510) mg, equivalent to D3-D4. Some P. falciparum cases without a k13-propeller mutation showed obvious delayed clearance of the parasite from peripheral blood. Trial registration The diagnosis of malaria and the treatment of malaria-infected patients are the routine work of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Information on the patients was conveyed with the patient's approval, and the research aim, methods, risks and benefits of the study were explained in detail to the patients

TI Ultrasensitive loop mediated isothermal amplification (US-LAMP) to
   detect malaria for elimination
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria elimination requires diagnostic methods able to detect parasite levels well below what is currently possible with microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. This is particularly true in surveillance of malaria at the population level that includes so-called "asymptomatic" individuals. Methods The development of the first ultrasensitive loop mediated amplification method capable of detecting malaria from both whole blood and dried blood spots (DBS) is described. The 18S rRNA and corresponding genes that remain stable on DBS for up to 5 months are targeted. Results In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, lower limits of detection of 25 parasite/mL and 50-100 parasite/mL from whole blood and DBS were obtained, respectively. A sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI 82.5-99.8) and specificity of 99.1% (95% CI 97.6-99.7) was obtained for the detection of all species in asymptomatic individuals from Africa and Asia (n = 494). Conclusion This tool is ideally suited for low middle-income countries where malaria is endemic and ultrasensitive surveillance of malaria is highly desirable for elimination.

TI Genomic and biological features of Plasmodium falciparum resistance
   against antimalarial endoperoxide N-89
SO GENE
AB Drug resistance of malaria parasites remains a problem affecting antimalarial treatment and control of the disease. We previously synthesized an antimalarial endoperoxide, N-89, having high antimalarial effects in vitro and in vivo. In this study we seek to understand the resistant mechanism against N-89 by establishing a highly N-89-resistant clone, named NRC10H, of the Plasmodium falciparum FCR-3 strain. We describe gene mutations in the parent FCR-3 strain and the NRC10H clone using whole-genome sequencing and subsequently by expression profiling using quantitative real-time PCR. Seven genes related to drug resistance, proteolysis, glycopho-sphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis exhibited a single amino acid substitution in the NRC10H clone. Among these seven genes, the multidrug resistance protein 2 (mdr2) variant A532S was found only in NRC10H. The genetic status of the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium binding protein (PfERC), a potential target of N-89, was similar between the NRC10H clone and the parent FCR-3 strain. These findings suggest that the genetic alterations of the identified seven genes, in particular mdr2, in NRC10H could give rise to resistance of the antimalarial endoperoxide N-89.

TI The changing landscape of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Drug resistant malaria is a growing concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where previous studies indicate that parasites resistant to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine or chloroquine are spatially clustered. This study explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative surveys.
   Methods: We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates over space and time.
   Results: The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G mutations increased by 16% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady.
   Conclusions: This study uses population-representative samples to describe the changing landscape of SP resistance within the DRC, and the persistence of chloroquine resistance. Vigilant molecular surveillance is critical for controlling the spread of resistance.

TI Review of malaria situation in Cameroon: technical viewpoint on
   challenges and prospects for disease elimination
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Malaria still has a devastating impact on public health and welfare in Cameroon. Despite the increasing number of studies conducted on disease prevalence, transmission patterns or treatment, there are to date, not enough studies summarising findings from previous works in order to identify gaps in knowledge and areas of interest where further evidence is needed to drive malaria elimination efforts. The present study seeks to address these gaps by providing a review of studies conducted so far on malaria in Cameroon since the 1940s to date. Over 250 scientific publications were consulted for this purpose. Although there has been increased scale-up of vector control interventions which significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality to malaria across the country from a prevalence of 41% of the population reporting at least one malaria case episode in 2000 to a prevalence of 24% in 2017, the situation is not yet under control. There is a high variability in disease endemicity between epidemiological settings with prevalence of Plasmodium parasitaemia varying from 7 to 85% in children aged 6 months to 15 years after long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) scale-up. Four species of Plasmodium have been recorded across the country: Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax. Several primate-infecting Plasmodium spp. are also circulating in Cameroon. A decline of artemisinin-based combinations therapeutic efficacy from 97% in 2006 to 90% in 2016 have been reported. Several mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance (Pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes conferring resistance to either 4-amino-quinoleine, mefloquine, halofanthrine and quinine have been documented. Mutations in the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes involved in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are also on the rise. No mutation associated with artemisinin resistance has been recorded. Sixteen anopheline species contribute to malaria parasite transmission with six recognized as major vectors: An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis, An. funestus, An. nili and An. moucheti. Studies conducted so far, indicated rapid expansion of DDT, pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and An. funestus threatening the performance of LLINs. This review highlights the complex situation of malaria in Cameroon and the need to urgently implement and reinforce integrated control strategies in different epidemiological settings, as part of the substantial efforts to consolidate gains and advance towards malaria elimination in the country.

TI A geostatistical framework for combining spatially referenced disease
   prevalence data from multiple diagnostics
SO BIOMETRICS
AB Multiple diagnostic tests are often used due to limited resources or because they provide complementary information on the epidemiology of a disease under investigation. Existing statistical methods to combine prevalence data from multiple diagnostics ignore the potential overdispersion induced by the spatial correlations in the data. To address this issue, we develop a geostatistical framework that allows for joint modelling of data from multiple diagnostics by considering two main classes of inferential problems: (a) to predict prevalence for a gold-standard diagnostic using low-cost and potentially biased alternative tests; (b) to carry out joint prediction of prevalence from multiple tests. We apply the proposed framework to two case studies: mapping Loa loa prevalence in Central and West Africa, using miscroscopy, and a questionnaire-based test called RAPLOA; mapping Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence in the highlands of Western Kenya using polymerase chain reaction and a rapid diagnostic test. We also develop a Monte Carlo procedure based on the variogram in order to identify parsimonious geostatistical models that are compatible with the data. Our study highlights (a) the importance of accounting for diagnostic-specific residual spatial variation and (b) the benefits accrued from joint geostatistical modelling so as to deliver more reliable and precise inferences on disease prevalence.

TI Plasma cytokine profiles associated with rhodesiense sleeping sickness
   and falciparum malaria co-infection in North Eastern Uganda
SO ALLERGY ASTHMA AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: Immunological Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) studies often exclude malaria, although both infections overlap in specific endemic areas. During this co-infection, it is not known whether this parasitic interaction induces synergistic or antagonistic cytokine response among humans. This study determined prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense HAT and plasma cytokine profile levels associated with HAT and/or malaria infections.
   Methods: Participants were recruited at Lwala hospital in north eastern Uganda: healthy controls (30), malaria (28), HAT (17), HAT and malaria (15) diagnosed by microscopy and PCR was carried out for parasite species identification. Plasma cytokine levels of Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) were measured by sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay and data statistically analysed using Graphpad Prism 6.0.
   Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum malaria among T. rhodesiense HAT cases was high (46.8%). Malaria and/or HAT cases presented significant higher plasma cytokine levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta than healthy controls (P < 0.05). Levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in HAT over malaria (P < 0.05) but no significant difference in TNF-alpha and TGF-beta between HAT and malaria (P > 0.05). Co-infection expressed significantly higher plasma IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 levels than malaria (P < 0.05) but no significant difference with HAT mono-infection (P > 0.05). The TNF-alpha level was significantly elevated in co-infection over HAT or malaria mono-infections (P < 0.05) unlike TGF-beta level. Significant positive correlations were identified between IFN-gamma verses TNF-alpha and IL-6 verses IL-10 in co-infection (Spearman's P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The T. b. rhodesiense significantly induced the cytokine response more than P. falciparum infections. Co-infection led to synergistic stimulation of pro-inflammatory (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), and anti-inflammatory (IL-6, and IL-10) cytokine responses relative to malaria mono-infection. Level of TNF-alpha partially indicates the effect induced by T. b. rhodesiense and P. falciparum mono-infections or a synergistic interaction of co-infections which may have adverse effects on pathogenesis, prognosis and resolution of the infections.

TI pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 Gene Deletions That Affect Malaria Rapid Diagnostic
   Tests for Plasmodium falciparum: Analysis of Archived Blood Samples From
   3 African Countries
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) that target histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) are important tools for Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis. Parasites with pfhrp2/3 gene deletions threaten the use of these mRDTs and have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America. We studied blood samples from 3 African countries to determine if these gene deletions were present.
   Methods. We analyzed 911 dried blood spots from Ghana (n = 165), Tanzania (n = 176), and Uganda (n = 570). Plasmodium falciparum infection was confirmed by 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and pfhrp2/3 genes were genotyped. True pfhrp2/3 gene deletions were confirmed if samples were (1) microscopy positive; (2) 18S rDNA PCR positive; (3) positive for merozoite surface protein genes by PCR or positive by loop-mediated isothermal amplification; or (4) quantitative PCR positive with >5 parasites/mu L.
   Results. No pfhrp2/3 deletions were detected in samples from Ghana, but deletions were identified in Tanzania (3 pfhrp2; 2 pfhrp3) and Uganda (7 pfhrp2; 2 pfhrp3). Of the 10 samples with pfhrp2 deletions, 9 tested negative by HRP2-based mRDT.
   Conclusions. The presence of pfhrp2/3 deletions in Tanzania and Uganda, along with reports of pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites in neighboring countries, reinforces the need for systematic surveillance to monitor the reliability of mRDTs in malaria-endemic countries.

TI The diagnostic performance of rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy for
   malaria diagnosis in eastern Sudan using a nested polymerase chain
   reaction assay as a reference standard
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Background: Accurate diagnosis of malaria infection is essential for successful control and management of the disease. Both microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are recommended for malaria diagnosis, however, RDTs are more commonly used. The aim of the current study was to assess the performance of microscopy and RDTs in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as the gold standard.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Kassala Hospital, eastern Sudan. A total of 341 febrile participants of all ages were recruited. Blood specimens were collected and malaria testing was performed using an RDT (SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf), microscopy and nested PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) of microscopy and the RDT were investigated.
   Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum malaria infections in this study was 22.9%, 24.3% and 26.7% by PCR, microscopy and RDT, respectively. Compared with microscopy, the RDT had slightly higher sensitivity (80.7% vs 74.3%; p=0.442), equivalent specificity (89.3% vs 90.4%), a similar PPV (69.2% vs 69.8%) and a higher NPV (94.0% vs 92.2%).
   Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of the RDT was better than that of microscopy in the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria when nested PCR was used as the gold standard.

TI Imported malaria and artemisinin-based combination therapy failure in
   travellers returning to Belgium: A retrospective study
SO TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB Background: Malaria (Plasmodium spp) remains a top cause of travel-associated morbidity among European residents. Here, we describe recent trends of imported malaria to Belgium and characterize the first cases of P.falciparum failure to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
   Methods: National surveillance data and registers from national reference laboratory were used to investigate malaria cases and ACT failures in the past 20 years. Recurrent infections were confirmed by pfmsp genotyping and polymorphisms in drug resistance-associated genes pfk13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfpm2, pfap2mu and pfubp1 were determined by sequencing or quantitative PCR.
   Results: Annual malaria cases steadily increased in the last decade, reaching 428 in 2017 (all species). An estimated 15% of P.falciparum cases were severe. Between 2014 and 2017, 727P. falcipanim cases were reported and six non-immune travellers presented late recurrence. Five had hyperparasitaemia and/or signs of severe malaria at initial consultation. No mutations in ACT drug resistance markers were detected, although pfcrt-pfmdr1 haplotypes associated with lumefantrine tolerance were common.
   Conclusions: The upward trend in imported malaria, the substantial proportion of severe cases and the emergence of ACT failures are sources of concern, although late failures were infrequent. Genetic analysis did not support parasitological resistance to ACT, suggesting prospective pharmacokinetic studies should assess adequacy of partner drug dosage and duration of treatment in non-immune populations.

TI RON2, a novel gene in Babesia bigemina, contains conserved,
   immunodominant B-cell epitopes that induce antibodies that block
   merozoite invasion
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB Bovine babesiosis is the most important protozoan disease transmitted by ticks. In Plasmodium falciparum, another Apicomplexa protozoan, the interaction of rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) with apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) has been described to have a key role in the invasion process. To date, RON2 has not been described in Babesia bigemina, the causal agent of bovine babesiosis in the Americas. In this work, we found a ron2 gene in the B. bigemina genome. RON2 encodes a protein that is 1351 amino acids long, has an identity of 64% (98% coverage) with RON2 of B. bovis and contains the CLAG domain, a conserved domain in Apicomplexa. B. bigemina ron2 is a single copy gene and it is transcribed and expressed in blood stages as determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and confocal microscopy. Serum samples from B. bigemina-infected bovines were screened for the presence of RON2-specific antibodies, showing the recognition of conserved B-cell epitopes. Importantly, in vitro neutralization assays showed an inhibitory effect of RON2-specific antibodies on the red blood cell invasion by B. bigemina. Therefore, RON2 is a novel antigen in B. bigemina and contains conserved B-cell epitopes, which induce antibodies that inhibit merozoite invasion.

TI Systematic review of the status of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion,
   approaches and methods used for its estimation and reporting in
   Plasmodium falciparum populations in Africa: review of published studies
   2010-2019
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria rapid diagnostic tests based on histidine-rich protein-2 have played a vital role in improving malaria case management and surveillance particularly in Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum is predominant. However, their usefulness has been threatened by the emergence of gene deletion on P. falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) and P. falciparum histidine rich protein 3 (pfhrp3). Use of standard and recommended methods is key for accurate investigation, confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion. Methods A systematic review was conducted to assess the status, methods and approaches that have been used for investigation, confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion in Africa. An online search was done using PubMed and MEDLINE Google Scholar for all articles published in English on pfhrp2/3 gene deletion in Africa. Relevant articles that met the inclusion criteria were summarized and assessed based on the protocol recommended by the World Health Organization for confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2/3 gene deletion. Results The search identified a total of 18 articles out of which 14 (77.7%) fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and were retained for review. The articles were distributed across 12 countries where the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion studies were conducted and reported. The level of pfhrp2/3 gene deletion across selected studies in Africa ranged from the highest 62% to the lowest 0.4%. There was wide variation in methods and approaches including study designs, size and sampling and whether both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 double deletions or pfhrp2 single deletion were investigated, with a wide variation in laboratory methods. Conclusion Based on the review, there is evidence of the presence of pfhrp2/3 gene-deleted P. falciparum parasites in Africa. The approaches and methods used for investigation, confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites have varied between studies and across countries. Countries that are considering plans to investigate, confirm and report pfhrp2/3 deletion should use recommended standard and harmonized methods to prevent unnecessary recommendations for costly switch of RDTs in Africa.

TI Occurrence and seasonal variation of human Plasmodium infection in
   Punjab Province, Pakistan
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background Malaria is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Pakistan is considered as a moderate malaria-endemic country but still, 177 million individuals are at risk of malaria. Roughly 60% of Pakistan's population, live in malaria-endemic regions. The present study is based upon the survey of various health care centers in 10 major cities of Northern and Southern Punjab to find out the malarial infection patterns in 2015. The diagnosis, seasonal variations, age and gender-wise distribution of Plasmodium spp. circulating in the study area were also included in the objectives. Methods The malaria-suspected patients '16075' were enrolled for malaria diagnosis using microscopy, out of which 925 were malaria positive which were processed for molecular analysis using nested PCR. The 18S rRNA genes of Plasmodium species were amplified, sequenced, blast and the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequences using online integrated tool MEGA7. Results The 364 cases recruited from Northern Punjab with the highest incidence in Rawalpindi (25.5%) and lowest in Chakwal (15.9%). From Southern Punjab 561 cases were enlisted Rajanpur (21.4%) maximum and lowest from Multan and Rahim Yar Khan (18%). The slide positivity rate, annual parasite incidence, and annual blood examination rates were 5.7 per 1000 population, 0.1, and 0.2% respectively. The only P. vivax (66.7%), P. falciparum (23.7%) and mixed infection by these two species (9.6%) were diagnosed. The same trend (P. vivax > P. falciparum > mixed infection) in species identification %age was confirmed from molecular analysis. However, the occurrence of malaria was higher in Southern Punjab (5.5%) as compared to the Northern Punjab (4.0%). The overall malaria percentage occurrence of treatment-seeking patients in all recruited cities of Punjab was 4.9%. The age-group of 1-20 and males among genders were more affected by malaria. The comparison of different seasons showed that the malaria infection was at a peak in Summer and post-monsoon. Conclusion The incidence of malaria was high in the flood infected rural areas of Southern Punjab, Summer, and post-monsoon. The age group (1-20) and gender-wise males were more affected by malaria.

TI A Comparison Between Manual Count, Flow Cytometry and Quantitative
   Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction as a Means of Determining Babesia
   rossi Parasitaemia in Naturally Infected Dogs
SO ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB Purpose Light microscopic manual count is the current gold standard for parasite quantification. The ability to determine parasite density in whole blood is crucial to understanding disease pathogenesis and finding a suitable automated method of Babesia rossi parasite quantification would facilitate higher throughput and provide results that are more objective. This study investigated both peripheral capillary and central venous whole blood to estimate the correlations between light microscopy, flow cytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Methods Peripheral capillary and central venous blood were sampled from 40 naturally B. rossi-infected dogs and 10 healthy control dogs. Samples were analysed by reverse line blot hybridization assay to confirm a mono-B. rossi infection. Capillary blood parasite density was detected using light microscopic manual counting and venous blood parasitaemia detected by manual counts, flow cytometry and qPCR. Results A significant correlation was found between the venous manual counts and flow cytometry (r(s) = 0.465; P < 0.001), as well as qPCR (r(s) = - 0.500; P < 0.001). A significant correlation was also observed between the capillary manual counts compared to venous manual counts (r(s) = 0.793; P < 0.001), flow cytometry (r(s) = 0.399; P = 0.004), and qPCR (r(s) = - 0.526; P < 0.001). Conclusions The study results suggest that qPCR is of value as an alternative to the gold standard manual count for detecting B. rossi parasitaemia in canine whole blood and that flow cytometry may be useful with further refinement of issues such as background fluorescence and the influence of reticulocytes.

TI Bacteremia Among Febrile Patients Attending Selected Healthcare
   Facilities in Ibadan, Nigeria
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. The relative contribution of bacterial infections to febrile disease is poorly understood in many African countries due to diagnostic limitations. This study screened pediatric and adult patients attending 4 healthcare facilities in Ibadan, Nigeria, for bacteremia and malaria parasitemia.
   Methods. Febrile patients underwent clinical diagnosis, malaria parasite testing, and blood culture. Bacteria from positive blood cultures were isolated and speciated using biochemical and serological methods, and Salmonella subtyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion.
   Results. A total of 682 patients were recruited between 16 June and 16 October 2017; 467 (68.5%) were <18 years of age. Bacterial pathogens were cultured from the blood of 117 (17.2%) patients, with Staphylococcus aureus (69 [59.0%]) and Salmonella enterica (34 [29.1%]) being the most common species recovered. Twenty-seven (79.4%) of the Salmonella isolates were serovar Typhi and the other 7 belonged to nontyphoidal Salmonella serovarieties. Thirty-four individuals were found to be coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum and bacteria. Five (14.7%) of these coinfections were with Salmonella, all in children aged <5 years. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that most of the Salmonella and Staphylococcus isolates were multidrug resistant.
   Conclusions. The study demonstrates that bacteria were commonly recovered from febrile patients with or without malaria in this location. Focused and extended epidemiological studies are needed for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines that have the potential to prevent a major cause of severe community-acquired febrile diseases in our locality.

TI The burden of submicroscopic and asymptomatic malaria in India revealed
   from epidemiology studies at three varied transmission sites in India
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria in India, while decreasing, remains a serious public health problem, and the contribution of submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections to its persistence is poorly understood. We conducted community surveys and clinic studies at three sites in India differing in their eco-epidemiologies: Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Nadiad (Gujarat), and Rourkela (Odisha), during 2012-2015. A total of 6,645 subject blood samples were collected for Plasmodium diagnosis by microscopy and PCR, and an extensive clinical questionnaire completed. Malaria prevalence ranged from 3-8% by PCR in community surveys (24 infections in Chennai, 56 in Nadiad, 101 in Rourkela), with Plasmodium vivax dominating in Chennai (70.8%) and Nadiad (67.9%), and Plasmodium falciparum in Rourkela (77.3%). A proportional high burden of asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections was detected in community surveys in Chennai (71% and 71%, respectively, 17 infections for both) and Rourkela (64% and 31%, 65 and 31 infections, respectively). In clinic studies, a proportional high burden of infections was identified as submicroscopic in Rourkela (45%, 42 infections) and Chennai (19%, 42 infections). In the community surveys, anemia and fever were significantly more common among microscopic than submicroscopic infections. Exploratory spatial analysis identified a number of potential malaria hotspots at all three sites. There is a considerable burden of submicroscopic and asymptomatic malaria in malarious regions in India, which may act as a reservoir with implications for malaria elimination strategies.

TI Genetic polymorphism of merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 of Plasmodium
   falciparum in the China-Myanmar border region
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria is a major public health problem in the China-Myanmar border region. The genetic structure of malaria parasite may affect its transmission model and control strategies. The present study was to analyse genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum by merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP1 and MSP2) and to determine the multiplicity of infection in clinical isolates in the China-Myanmar border region.
   Methods: Venous blood samples (172) and filter paper blood spots (70) of P. falciparum isolates were collected from the patients of the China-Myanmar border region from 2006 to 2011. The genomic DNA was extracted, and the msp1 and msp2 genes were genotyped by nested PCR using allele-specific primers for P. falciparum.
   Results: A total of 215 P. falciparum clinical isolates were genotyped at the msp1 (201) and msp2 (204), respectively. For the msp1 gene, MAD20 family was dominant (53.49%), followed by the K1 family (44.65%), and the RO33 family (12.56%). For the msp2 gene, the most frequent allele was the FC27 family (80.93%), followed by the 3D7 family (75.81%). The total multiplicity of infection (MOI) of msp1 and msp2 was 1.76 and 2.21, with a prevalence of 64.19% and 72.09%, respectively. A significant positive correlation between the MOI and parasite density was found in the msp1 gene of P. falciparum. Sequence analysis revealed 38 different alleles of msp1 (14 K1, 23 MAD20, and 1 RO33) and 52 different alleles of msp2 (37 3D7 and 15 FC27).
   Conclusion: The present study showed the genetic polymorphisms with diverse allele types of msp1 and msp2 as well as the high MOI of P. falciparum clinical isolates in the China-Myanmar border region.

TI Multiplex malaria antigen detection by bead-based assay and molecular
   confirmation by PCR shows no evidence of Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 deletion in
   Haiti
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The Plasmodium falciparum parasite is the only human malaria that produces the histidine-rich protein 2 and 3 (HRP2/3) antigens. Currently, HRP2/3 are widely used in malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), but several global reports have recently emerged showing genetic deletion of one or both of these antigens in parasites. Deletion of these antigens could pose a major concern for P. falciparum diagnosis in Haiti which currently uses RDTs based solely on the detection of the HRP2/3 antigens. Methods From September 2012 through February 2014, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected in Haiti from 9317 febrile patients presenting to 17 health facilities in 5 departments throughout the country as part of a bed net intervention study. All DBS from RDT positive persons and a random sampling of DBS from RDT negative persons were assayed for P. falciparum DNA by nested and PET-PCR (n = 2695 total). All PCR positive samples (n = 331) and a subset of PCR negative samples (n = 95) were assayed for three malaria antigens by a multiplex bead assay: pan-Plasmodium aldolase (pAldo), pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and HRP2/3. Any samples positive for P. falciparum DNA, but negative for HRP2/3 antigens were tested by nested PCR for Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 gene deletions. Results Of 2695 DBS tested for Plasmodium DNA, 345 (12.8%) were originally found to be positive for P. falciparum DNA; 331 of these had DBS available for antigen detection. Of these, 266 (80.4%) were positive for pAldo, 221 (66.8%) positive for pLDH, and 324 (97.9%) were positive for HRP2/3 antigens. Seven samples (2.1%) positive for P. falciparum DNA were not positive for any of the three antigens by the bead assay, and were investigated for potential Pfhrp2/3 gene deletion by PCR. These samples either successfully amplified Pfhrp2/3 genes or were at an estimated parasite density too low for sufficient DNA to perform successful genotyping. Conclusions Malaria positive samples in multiple Haitian sites were found to contain the HRP2/3 antigens, and no evidence was found of Pfhrp2/3 deletions. Malaria RDTs based on the detection of the HRP2/3 antigens remain a reliable P. falciparum diagnostic tool as Haiti works towards malaria elimination.

TI Rubber plantations and drug resistant malaria: a cross-sectional survey
   in Cambodia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The ongoing spread of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major threat to global health. In response, countries in the Greater Mekong Sub-region, including Cambodia, have declared ambitious goals to eliminate malaria. Major challenges include the lack of information on the at-risk population-individuals who live or work in or near the forest where the malaria vectors are found, including plantation workers. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap through a cross-sectional survey conducted in rubber plantations in Cambodia in 2014. Methods The survey was conducted in two rounds in four provinces and included a malaria prevalence survey, analysis for the K13 genetic mutation, and a comprehensive behavioural questionnaire. Forty plantations were included in each round, and 4201 interviews were conducted. An additional 701 blood samples were collected from family members of plantation workers. Results Overall malaria prevalence was relatively low with adjusted PCR prevalence rate of 0.6% for P. falciparum and 0.3% for Plasmodium vivax, and was very heterogenous between plantations. There was little difference in risk between permanent residents and temporary workers, and between the two rounds. The main risk factors for P. falciparum infection were smaller plantations, age under 30 years, lack of self-reported use of a treated net and recent travel, especially to the Northeastern provinces. Proximity of plantations to the forest was also a risk factor for malaria in round one, while male gender was also a risk factor for malaria by either species. Conclusions With Cambodia's P. falciparum elimination target on the horizon, identifying every single malaria case will become increasingly important. Plantations workers are relatively accessible compared to some other at-risk groups and will likely remain a high priority. Ongoing surveillance and adaptive strategies will be critical if malaria elimination is to be achieved in this setting.

TI Amplicon deep sequencing improves Plasmodium falciparum genotyping in
   clinical trials of antimalarial drugs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Clinical trials monitoring malaria drug resistance require genotyping of recurrent Plasmodium falciparum parasites to distinguish between treatment failure and new infection occurring during the trial follow up period. Because trial participants usually harbour multi-clonal P. falciparum infections, deep amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) was employed to improve sensitivity and reliability of minority clone detection. Paired samples from 32 drug trial participants were Illumina deep-sequenced for five molecular markers. Reads were analysed by custom-made software HaplotypR and trial outcomes compared to results from the previous standard genotyping method based on length-polymorphic markers. Diversity of AmpSeq markers in pre-treatment samples was comparable or higher than length-polymorphic markers. AmpSeq was highly reproducible with consistent quantification of co-infecting parasite clones within a host. Outcomes of the three best-performing markers, cpmp, cpp and ama1-D3, agreed in 26/32 (81%) of patients. Discordance between the three markers performed per sample was much lower by AmpSeq (six patients) compared to length-polymorphic markers (eleven patients). Using AmpSeq for discrimination of recrudescence and new infection in antimalarial drug trials provides highly reproducible and robust characterization of clone dynamics during trial follow-up. AmpSeq overcomes limitations inherent to length-polymorphic markers. Regulatory clinical trials of antimalarial drugs will greatly benefit from this unbiased typing method.

TI Nucleic acid purification from dried blood spot on FTA Elute Card
   provides template for polymerase chain reaction for highly sensitive
   Plasmodium detection
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an essential diagnostic method for highly sensitive detection of Plasmodium infected erythrocytes in patients with malaria. This study compared the performance of filter papers used for the preparation of dried blood spots (DBS) in detecting Plasmodium by PCR. Whole blood spiked with P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to obtain samples with various levels of parasitemia were applied to Whatman 3MM Chr papers, FTA Cards, or FTA Elute Cards to prepare the DBS. DNA was purified from the DBS using a DNA purification kit and used as the template for nested PCR. In probit analysis, the estimated limit of detection (LoD) was 5.5 parasites/mu L blood for Whatman 3MM Chr papers and FTA Cards and 1.6 parasites/mu L blood for the FTA Elute Card. This result suggested that the DBS prepared on an FTA Elute Card yield the best template DNA for subsequent high-sensitivity PCR-based detection of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. This finding can help improve the accuracy of malarial diagnostic tests.

TI PCR-BASED SCREENING OF PLASMODIUM SPECIES IN MOSQUITO VECTORS OF
   FAISALABAD DISTRICT, PUNJAB, PAKISTAN
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES
AB Plasmodium (P), mosquito-borne unicellular parasite, is responsible for "malaria". Pakistan remains at risk of malaria and almost 1.6 million cases of malaria are reported every year. The present study was planned to screen the mosquito vectors for Plasmodium sp. in Faisalabad district, Punjab, Pakistan using nested PCR. For this purpose, convenient sampling of adult mosquitoes was done from different places including: animal populated areas, lavatories, water storage tanks, livestock farms and road-side ditches in 70% ethanol. DNA extraction was done after stereomicroscopic identification of the specimens. Species identification of P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovate and P. malariae was done through universal forward and species-specific reverse primers in the nested PCR. Prevalence of Culex mosquitoes was higher as compared to Anopheles. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were found higher as compared to other species of Plasmodium. The overall prevalence of Plasmodium sp. in mosquito vectors was 46% (14 out of 30 pools for Plasmodium sp.). Results were analyzed through chi-square analyses. Present study may explore the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes which can be an indicator of Plasmodium sp. distribution in an area for large scale metagenomics.

TI Digital PCR: a new technology for diagnosis of parasitic infections
SO CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB Background: Parasitic infections are responsible for a significant burden of disease worldwide as a result of international travel and immigration. More accurate diagnostic tools are necessary in support to parasite control and elimination programmes in endemic regions as well as for rapid case detection in non-endemic areas. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a powerful technology with recent applications in parasitology.
   Aims: This review provides for the first time an overview of dPCR as a novel technology applied to detection of parasitic infections, and highlights the most relevant potential benefits of this assay.
   Sources: Peer-reviewed literature pertinent to this review based on PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases as well as laboratory experience of authors.
   Content: Among the 86 studies retrieved, 17 used the dPCR applied to parasites belonging to protozoa (8), helminths (8) and arthropods (1) of clinical human interest. dPCR was adopted in four studies, respectively, for Plasmodium and Schistosoma japonicum. dPCR led to clear advantages over quantitative real-time PCR in P. falciparum and spp., and in S. japonicum showing higher sensitivity; and in Cryptosporidium with higher stability to inhibitors from stool. For all parasites, dPCR allows absolute quantitation without the need of a standard curve. Various dPCR platforms were used. A few critical factors need consideration: DNA load, choice of platform and reaction optimization. (C) 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles in settings
   with different levels of Plasmodium vivax co-endemicity in Ethiopia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax co-exist at different endemicity levels across Ethiopia. For over two decades Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) is the first line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum, while chloroquine (CQ) is still used to treat P. vivax. It is currently unclear whether a shift from CQ to AL for P. falciparum treatment has implications for AL efficacy and results in a reversal of mutations in genes associated to CQ resistance, given the high co-endemicity of the two species and the continued availability of CQ for the treatment of P. vivax. This study thus assessed the prevalence of Pfcrt-K76T and Pfrndrl-N86Y point mutations in P. falciparum. 18S RNA gene based nested PCR confirmed P. falciparum samples (N = 183) collected through community and health facility targeted cross-sectional surveys from settings with varying P. vivax and P. falciparum endemicity were used. The proportion of Plasmodium infections that were P. vivax was 62.2% in Adama, 41.4% in Babile, 30.0% in Benishangul-Gumuz to 6.9% in Gambella. The Pfcrt-76T mutant haplotype was observed more from samples with higher endemicity of P. vivax as being 98.4% (61/62), 100% (31/31), 65.2% (15/23) and 41.5% (22/53) in samples from Adama, Babile, Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambella, respectively. However, a relatively higher proportion of Pfmdr1-N86 allele (77.3-100%) were maintained in all sites. The observed high level of the mutant Pfcrt-76T allele in P. vivax co-endemic sites might require that utilization of CQ needs to be re-evaluated in settings co-endemic for the two species. A country-wide assessment is recommended to clarify the implication of the observed level of variation in drug resistance markers on the efficacy of AL-based treatment against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

TI Persistence of High In Vivo Efficacy and Safety of
   Artesunate-Amodiaquine and Artemether-Lumefantrine as the First- and
   Second-Line Treatments for Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
   10 Years After Their Implementation in Gabon
SO ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB Purpose Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) have been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria since 2005 in Gabon. Since 2011, a rebound of malaria morbidity has been observed in this country, while no survey evaluating ACT efficacy was performed. During the same period, parasite resistance against artemisinin has been reported in Asia. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of these two drugs in two sentinel sites of Gabon 10 years after their implementation. Methods Children aged from 12 to 144 months with uncomplicated malaria were recruited at the Regional Hospital of Melen, Libreville and in the Urban Health Center of Franceville between March 2014 and September 2015. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated according to the WHO 2008 protocol of 28-day follow-up and PCR-uncorrected/corrected treatment outcomes were assessed. Results One hundred and eighty-five children (98 ASAQ and 89 AL) were followed up until day 28. The PCR-corrected ACPR was 98.9% for AS-AQ and 96.4% for AL. Late therapeutic failure rate was 3.6% and 1.1% for AL and AS-AQ, respectively (p = 0.2). Adverse events and serious adverse events were rarely observed with both treatments. Conclusion AS-AQ and AL are still efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Gabonese children.

TI Detection of malaria with light microscopy and Nested polymerase chain
   reaction (Nested PCR) methods in peripheral blood expansions and
   investigation of the genetic diversity of Plasmodium species by 18S rRNA
   gene in Southeast of Iran
SO MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
AB Background: Malaria is a public health concern that leads to about a million deaths worldwide every year. Malaria is caused by the genus Plasmodium, which includes P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. Molecular phylogeny is essential to better recognition the evolution of the genus Plasmodium genus and detection of the relative degree of Plasmodium species in humans. The aim of this study was to detect malaria with Light Microscopy (LM) and Nested polymerase chain reaction (Nested PCR) methods in peripheral blood expansions and to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium species by 18S rRNA gene in the southeast of Iran.
   Methods: A total of 97 blood smears were collected from patients suspected to malaria in a 6-year period in the southeast of Iran including Hormozgan, Kerman, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. Diagnosis of Plasmodium species on blood smears was performed using LM and Nested PCR methods. In addition, 16 Plasmodium-positive samples were chosen for the determination of genetic diversity.
   Results: Overall, 97 of 97 (100%) studied cases were positive by LM while 94 of 97 (96.8%) of them were detected as malaria by Nested PCR. Except for seven cases, Nested PCR confirmed the LM results. These samples involved two P. vivax and five P. falciparum in the LM method. Meanwhile, the Nested PCR was detected in all of the cases as a mixed infection with P. vivax and P. falciparum. The results of the phylogenetic analysis revealed two main clades and five different subclades. About 87.5% of the isolates were located in Glade I and contained P. vivax. In addition, 12.5% of the studied isolates involved P. falciparum that was in Glade II.
   Conclusion: According to our results, Nested PCR method had higher sensitivity than LM and is suggested as a good approach for malaria detection. Consideration the wide diversity of tested isolates and the importance of vaccine development, which is affected by this diversity, further studies are needed in this regard.

TI Pregnancy and CYP3A5 Genotype Affect Day 7 Plasma Lumefantrine
   Concentrations
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Pregnancy and pharmacogenetics variation alter drug disposition and treatment outcome. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pregnancy and pharmacogenetics variation on day 7 lumefantrine (LF) plasma concentration and therapeutic responses in malaria-infected women treated with artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in Tanzania. A total of 277 (205 pregnant and 72 nonpregnant) women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were enrolled. Patients were treated with ALu and followed up for 28 days. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 genotyping were done. Day 7 plasma LF concentration and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28 were determined. The mean day 7 plasma LF concentrations were significantly lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women [geometric mean ratio = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean ratio (1.119-1.1745), P < 0.003]. Pregnancy, low body weight, and CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype were significantly associated with low day 7 LF plasma concentration (P < 0.01). PCR-corrected ACPR was 93% (95% CI 5 89.4-96.6) in pregnant women and 95.7% (95% CI 5 90.7-100) in nonpregnant women. Patients with lower day 7 LF concentration had a high risk of treatment failure (mean 652 vs. 232 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pregnancy, low body weight, and CYP3A5*1 allele are significant predictors of low day 7 LF plasma exposure. In turn, lower day 7 LF concentration is associated with a higher risk of recrudescence.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
   This study reports a number of factors contributing to the lower day 7 lumefantrine (LF) concentration in women, which includes pregnancy, body weight, and CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. It also shows that day 7 LF concentration is a main predictor of malaria treatment. These findings highlight the need to look into artemether-LF dosage adjustment in pregnant women so as to be able to maintain adequate drug concentration, which is required to reduce treatment failure rates in pregnant women.

TI Monitoring the threatened utility of malaria rapid diagnostic tests by
   novel high-throughput detection of Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 and hrp3
   deletions: A cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum deficient for hrp2 and hrp3 genes are a threat to malaria management and elimination, since they escape widely used HRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests and treatment. Hrp2/hrp3 deletions are increasingly reported from all malaria endemic regions but are currently only identified by laborious methodologies.
   Methods: We developed a novel hydrolysis probe-based, quantitative, real-time PCR (4plex qPCR) for detection and discrimination of P. falciparum infection (cytb) and hrp2 and hrp3 gene status, and to control assay validity (btub). A cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study was performed in Gabon for assay validation and deletion screening.
   Findings: In parallel to identification of P. falciparum infection in samples down to 0.05 parasites/mu l, the 4plex qPCR enabled specific and valid interrogation of the parasites's hrp2 and hrp3 genes in one go even in low parasitemic samples. The assay was precise and robust also when performed in a routine healthcare setting in Gabon. The risk of falsely identifying hrp2 or hrp3 deletion was reduced by 100-fold compared to conventional PCR. Evaluation against microscopy was performed on 200 blood samples collected in Gabon: sensitivity and specificity of 4plex qPCR (cytb) were 100% and 80%, respectively. Stringent testing revealed hrp2 deletion in 2 of 95 P. falciparum positive and validated samples.
   Interpretation: The novel 4plex qPCR is sensitive, accurate and allows resource-efficient rapid screening. Monitoring and mapping of hrp2/hrp3 deletions is required to identify areas where control strategies may need to be adapted to ensure appropriate patient care and ultimately achieve malaria elimination.

TI Novel RNA viruses associated with Plasmodium vivax in human malaria and
   Leucocytozoon parasites in avian disease
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Eukaryotes of the genus Plasmodium cause malaria, a parasitic disease responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in humans. Yet, the nature and abundance of any viruses carried by these divergent eukaryotic parasites is unknown. We investigated the Plasmodium virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples taken from patients suffering from malaria and infected with P. vivax, P. falciparum or P. knowlesi. This resulted in the identification of a narnavirus-like sequence, encoding an RNA polymerase and restricted to P. vivax samples, as well as an associated viral segment of unknown function. These data, confirmed by PCR, are indicative of a novel RNA virus that we term Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1) to reflect its analogy to a "Russian doll": a virus, infecting a parasite, infecting an animal. Additional screening revealed that MaRNAV-1 was abundant in geographically diverse P. vivax derived from humans and mosquitoes, strongly supporting its association with this parasite, and not in any of the other Plasmodium samples analyzed here nor Anopheles mosquitoes in the absence of Plasmodium. Notably, related bi-segmented narnavirus-like sequences (MaRNAV-2) were retrieved from Australian birds infected with a Leucocytozoon-a genus of eukaryotic parasites that group with Plasmodium in the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa. Together, these data support the establishment of two new phylogenetically divergent and genomically distinct viral species associated with protists, including the first virus likely infecting Plasmodium parasites. As well as broadening our understanding of the diversity and evolutionary history of the eukaryotic virosphere, the restriction to P. vivax may be of importance in understanding P. vivax-specific biology in humans and mosquitoes, and how viral co-infection might alter host responses at each stage of the P. vivax life-cycle.
   Author summary While parasites are a major cause of human disease, they can themselves be infected by viruses. We asked whether three of the major malaria-causing parasites in humans-Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum and P. knowlesi-were also infected by viruses. To this end we performed total RNA-Sequencing ("meta-transcriptomics") on human blood samples infected with these Plasmodium species. This resulted in the discovery of an abundant bi-segmented virus-Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1)-in all P. vivax samples tested (but no other Plasmodium species) that contains a replicase segment related to those of narnaviruses, arguably the simplest type of RNA viruses discovered to date. By screening for MaRNAV-1 in a larger set of Plasmodium species we revealed a strong specificity between this virus and P. vivax, as well as the presence of a related virus-MaRNAV-2-in avian Leucocytozoon hematozoa parasites. This is the first discovery of a Plasmodium-associated virus and will assist in revealing the deep evolutionary history of RNA viruses and our understanding of Plasmodium biology and disease processes.

TI ECOLOGY OF MALARIA VECTORS IN CERTIFIED MALARIA ELIMINATION AREAS IN
   JEMBRANA, BENGKALIS AND BULUKUMBA DISTRICTS
SO BULETIN PENELITIAN KESEHATAN
AB The target of malaria elimination in Indonesia is expected to be achieved in 2030. One of the activities to support malaria elimination is vector surveillance. Several districts in Indonesia have certificates of malaria, including Jembrana, Bali Province, Bulukumba, South Sulawesi Province, and Bengkalis, Riau Province. Analysis of the presence of malaria vectors and Plasmodium needs to be done for the potential occurances of malaria transmission in eliminated malaria areas. Bio-ecology study of malaria vectors were conducted to determine receptivity status and others risk factors and the potential for malaria transmission based on ecosystems in Jembrana, Bulukumba and Bengkalis districts. As part of national research of disease vector and reservoir (Rikhus Vektora), mosquitoes and larval field-collection methods, molecular plasmodium detection and blood meal analyses were carried out according Rikhus vektora guidelines. The result showed that Anopheles kochi and An. tesselatus were positive confirmed with Plasmodium falciparum by using PCR in Jembrana, Bali province, which were found in non-forest ecosystems near settlements and beaches near settlements. In addition, Anopheles barbirostris, Anopheles vagus, and Anopheles peditaeniatus were also positive confirmed with P. falciparum by using similar methods in Bulukumba, South Sulawesi province. An. barbirostris was found in forest ecosystems near settlement, Anopheles vagus was found in remote forest ecosystems of settlements and beaches near settlements, and Anopheles peditaenistus was found in non-forest ecosystems near settlements. While Anopheles sinensis was confirmed positive with P. falciparum in Bengkalis, Riau province. Jembrana, Bulukumba and Bengkalis districts are recognized as receptive areas and have potential for re-transmission of malaria. Vector surveillance and the implementation of approriate vector control and migration surveillance are needed to ascertain wheter the positive Anopheles with positives Plasmodium falciparum getting the parasites from imported cases or there has been a local transmission (indigenous) in these areas. This information is needed to prevent malaria re-transmission in the eliminated areas.

TI Strengthening Surveillance Systems for Malaria Elimination by
   Integrating Molecular and Genomic Data
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB Unprecedented efforts in malaria control over the last 15 years have led to a substantial decrease in both morbidity and mortality in most endemic settings. However, these progresses have stalled over recent years, and resurgence may cause dramatic impact on both morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, elimination efforts are currently going on with the objective of reducing malaria morbidity and mortality by 90% and malaria elimination in at least 35 countries by 2030. Strengthening surveillance systems is of paramount importance to reach those targets, and the integration of molecular and genomic techniques into routine surveillance could substantially improve the quality and robustness of data. Techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are increasingly available in malaria endemic countries, whereas others such as sequencing are already available in a few laboratories. However, sequencing, especially next-generation sequencing (NGS), requires sophisticated infrastructure with adequate computing power and highly trained personnel for data analysis that require substantial investment. Different techniques will be required for different applications, and cost-effective planning must ensure the appropriate use of available resources. The development of national and sub-regional reference laboratories could help in minimizing the resources required in terms of equipment and trained staff. Concerted efforts from different stakeholders at national, sub-regional, and global level are needed to develop the required framework to establish and maintain these reference laboratories.

TI Probing the composition of Plasmodium species contained in malaria
   infections in the Eastern region of Ghana
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background Asymptomatic falciparum and non-falciparum malaria infections are major challenges to malaria control interventions, as they remain a source of continual infection in the community. This becomes even more important as the debate moves towards elimination and eradication. This study sought to quantify the burden of Plasmodium malaria infection in seven communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Methods The cross-sectional study recruited 729 participants aged 85 years old and below from 7 closely linked communities. Finger pricked blood was used to prepare thick and thin blood smears as well as spot filter paper and an histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) rapid diagnostic test kit (RDT). Genomic DNA was extracted from the filter paper dry blood spot (DBS) and used in PCR to amplify the Plasmodium 18S rRNA gene using species specific PCR. Results 96.6% of the participants were identified as afebrile, with axillary temperatures below 37.5 degrees C. PCR identified 66% of the participants to harbor malaria parasites, with 9 P. malariae and 7 P. ovale mono-infections accounting for 2.2% and P. falciparum combined with either 36 P. malariae or 25 P. ovale infections, accounting for 13.3%. Parasite prevalence by microscopy (32%) was similar to the RDT positivity rate (33%). False positive RDT results ranged from 64.6% in children aged between 5 and 9 years to 10% in adults aged 20 years and above. No significant differences were observed in falciparum and non-falciparum parasite carriage at the community level, however young adults aged between 15 and 19 years had the highest prevalence (34.8% (16/46)) of P. falciparum and P. malariae parasite carriage whilst children aged between 5 and 9 years had the highest level (11.4% (14/123)) of P. ovale carriage. Conclusion The high rate of misidentification of non-falciparum parasites and the total absence of detection of P. ovale by microscopy suggests that more sensitive malaria diagnostic tools including molecular assays are required to accurately determine the prevalence of carriers of non-falciparum parasites and low density P. falciparum infections, especially during national surveillance exercises. Additionally, malaria control interventions targeting the non-falciparum species P. malariae and P. ovale parasites are needed.

TI En-route to the 'elimination' of genotypic chloroquine resistance in
   Western and Southern Zambia, 14 years after chloroquine withdrawal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Anti-malarial resistance is, and continues to be a significant challenge in the fight against malaria and a threat to achieving malaria elimination. In Zambia, chloroquine (CQ), a safe, affordable and well-tolerated drug, was removed from use in 2003 due to high levels of resistance evidenced with treatment failure. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of chloroquine resistance markers in Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia 14 years after the withdrawal of CQ.
   Methods: Data from a cross-sectional, all-age household survey, conducted during the peak malaria transmission season (April-May 2017) was analysed. During the all-age survey, socio-demographic information and coverage of malaria interventions were collected. Consenting individuals were tested for malaria with a rapid diagnostic test and a spot of blood collected on filter paper to create a dried blood spot (DBS). Photo-induced electronic transfer-polymerase chain reaction (PET-PCR) was used to analyse the DBS for the presence of all four malaria species. Plasmodium falciparum positive samples were analysed by high resolution melt (HRM) PCR to detect the presence of genotypic markers of drug resistance in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) and P. falciparum multi-drug resistance (Pfmdr) genes.
   Results: A total of 181 P. falciparum positive samples were examined for pfcrt K76T and MDR N86. Of the 181 samples 155 successfully amplified for Pfcrt and 145 for Pfmdr N86. The overall prevalence of CQ drug-resistant parasites was 1.9% (3/155), with no significant difference between the two provinces. No N86Y/F mutations in the Pfmdr gene were observed in any of the sample.
   Conclusion: This study reveals the return of CQ sensitive parasites in Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia 14 years after its withdrawal. Surveillance of molecular resistant markers for anti-malarials should be included in the Malaria Elimination Programme so that resistance is monitored country wide.

TI Gametocyte clearance in children, from western Kenya, with uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum malaria after artemether-lumefantrine or
   dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) against asexual parasites population has been documented. However, the effect of these anti-malarials on sexual parasites is still less clear. Gametocyte clearance following treatment is essential for malaria control and elimination efforts; therefore, the study sought to determine trends in gametocyte clearance after AL or DP treatment in children from a malaria-endemic site in Kenya.
   Methods: Children aged between 0.5 and 12 years from Busia, western Kenya with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were assigned randomly to AL or DP treatment. A total of 334 children were enrolled, and dried blood spot samples were collected for up to 6 weeks after treatment during the peak malaria transmission season in 2016 and preserved. Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes were detected by qRT-PCR and gametocyte prevalence, density and mean duration of gametocyte carriage were determined.
   Results: At baseline, all the 334 children had positive asexual parasites by microscopy, 12% (40/334) had detectable gametocyte by microscopy, and 83.7% (253/302) children had gametocytes by RT-qPCR. Gametocyte prevalence by RT-qPCR decreased from 85.1% (126/148) at day 0 to 7.04% (5/71) at day 42 in AL group and from 82.4% (127/154) at day 0 to 14.5% (11/74) at day 42 in DP group. The average duration of gametocyte carriage as estimated by qRT-PCR was slightly shorter in the AL group (4.5 days) than in the DP group (5.1 days) but not significantly different (p = 0.301).
   Conclusion: The study identifies no significant difference between AL and DP in gametocyte clearance. Gametocytes persisted up to 42 days post treatment in minority of individuals in both treatment arms. A gametocytocidal drug, in combination with artemisinin-based combination therapy, will be useful in blocking malaria transmission more efficiently.

TI Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from patients with
   uncomplicated and severe malaria based on msp-1 and msp-2 genes in
   Gublak, North West Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria infection can present with a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Plasmodium falciparum isolates in uncomplicated and severe malaria infections may have different parasite genetic profiles. This study was conducted to assess differences in genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in P. falciparum isolates according to malaria severity and age of patients in the Gublack area, northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: Cross-sectional health facility-based study conducted in Gublak, Ethiopia between July, 2017 and October, 2017. Symptomatic P. falciparum malaria patients with microscopically-confirmed infection were enrolled. Parasite DNA was extracted from filter paper blood spots and the polymorphic regions of the msp-1 and msp-2 genes were genotyped using allele-specific nested-PCR with fragment analysis by gel electrophoresis.
   Results: A total of 118 patients were enrolled including 95 (80.5%) with uncomplicated infection and 23 (19.5%) with severe disease. In msp-1, the K1 allelic family was similarly prevalent in uncomplicated 42 (44.2%) and severe disease 12 (52.2%). In msp-2, FC27 was detected in 55 (57.9%) of uncomplicated infections and IC/3D7 in 14 (60.9%) of severe infections. 76 (64.4%) of the 118 isolates contained multiple genotypes; 56 (58.9%) in uncomplicated infections and 19 (82.6%) in severe infections. The overall of multiplicity of infection was 2.2 (95% CI 1.98-2.42) with 1.4 (95% CI 1.23-1.55) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.49-1.86) for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. Multiplicity of infection was significantly higher in severe than uncomplicated infections (3.0 (95% CI 2.61-3.47) versus 2.0 (95% CI 1.83-2.23), respectively, p = 0.001). There was no difference in multiplicity of infection across age groups (p = 0.104).
   Conclusion: Patients with severe malaria were more likely to have multiclonal infections. Further studies are needed to describe the association between P. falciparum genotypes and malaria severity in different malaria transmission areas.

TI Diagnosis of Malaria Parasites Plasmodium spp. in Endemic Areas: Current
   Strategies for an Ancient Disease
SO BIOESSAYS
AB Fast and effective detection of the causative agent of malaria in humans, protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is of crucial importance for increasing the effectiveness of treatment and to control a devastating disease that affects millions of people living in endemic areas. The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films still remains the gold-standard in Plasmodium detection today. However, there is a high demand for alternative diagnostic methods that are simple, fast, highly sensitive, ideally do not rely on blood-drawing and can potentially be conducted by the patients themselves. Here, the history of Plasmodium detection is discussed, and advantages and disadvantages of diagnostic methods that are currently being applied are assessed.

TI Malaria resurgence after significant reduction by mass drug
   administration on Ngodhe Island, Kenya
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although WHO recommends mass drug administration (MDA) for malaria elimination, further evidence is required for understanding the obstacles for the optimum implementation of MDA. Just before the long rain in 2016, two rounds of MDA with artemisinin/piperaquine (Artequick) and low-dose primaquine were conducted with a 35-day interval for the entire population of Ngodhe Island (similar to 500 inhabitants) in Lake Victoria, Kenya, which is surrounded by areas with moderate and high transmission. With approximately 90% compliance, Plasmodium prevalence decreased from 3% to 0% by microscopy and from 10% to 2% by PCR. However, prevalence rebounded to 9% by PCR two months after conclusion of MDA. Besides the remained local transmission, parasite importation caused by human movement likely contributed to the resurgence. Analyses of 419 arrivals to Ngodhe between July 2016 and September 2017 revealed Plasmodium prevalence of 4.6% and 16.0% by microscopy and PCR, respectively. Risk factors for infection among arrivals included age (0 to 5 and 11 to 15 years), and travelers from Siaya County, located to the north of Ngodhe Island. Parasite importation caused by human movement is one of major obstacles to sustain malaria elimination, suggesting the importance of cross-regional initiatives together with local vector control.

TI High uptake of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in pregnancy
   is associated with improved birth weight among pregnant women in Ghana
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Despite the clinically proven advantages of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), utilisation has been low in many African countries. To increase uptake and achieve the desired effect, the World Health Organization revised the policy to a monthly administration. Assessing the coverage and impact of the revised policy on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes is, therefore, a necessity. A 2-parallel cross-sectional hospital-based study was carried out among pregnant women attending first antenatal care (ANC) and delivery. Maternal and cord blood samples were assayed for malaria parasites by quantitative PCR targeting both the 18S rDNA and the acidic terminal segment of Plasmodium falciparum var genes, and plasma SP levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Parasite prevalence was similar between the two study sites but decreased significantly between the first ANC (9% or 43%) and delivery (4% or 11%) based on the qPCR target. At delivery, 64.5% of women received >= 3 IPTp-SP dose, 15.5% received 2 doses and 6% had 1 dose. Taking >= 3 IPTp-SP doses was associated with an average birth weight increase of more than 0.165 kg. IPTp-SP uptake was associated with plasma SP level at delivery (OR= 32.3, p <= 0.005, 95% CI (13.3;78.4) for those that reported >= 3 IPTp-SP doses) while the same trend of improved birth weight was observed with high plasma SP levels. The new IPTp policy is well implemented and well utilised by women in the sites considered in this study and translates to the improved birth weight observed. This study confirms the interest and the clinical benefit expected from this policy change.

TI Monitoring of efficacy, tolerability and safety of
   artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine for the treatment of
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Lambarene, Gabon: an
   open-label clinical trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Malaria remains a major public health problem, affecting mainly low-and middle-income countries. The management of this parasitic disease is challenged by ever increasing drug resistance. This study, investigated the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), used as first-line drugs to treat uncomplicated malaria in Lambarene, Gabon.
   Methods: A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted between October 2017 and March 2018 to assess safety, clinical and parasitological efficacy of fixed-doses of AL and AS-AQ administered to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children aged from 6 months to 12 years. After 50 children were treated with AL, another 50 children received ASAQ. The 2009 World Health Organization protocol for monitoring of the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs was followed. Molecular markers msp1 and msp2 were used to differentiate recrudescence and reinfection. For the investigation of artemisinin resistant markers, gene mutations in Pfk13 were screened.
   Results: Per-protocol analysis on day 28 showed a PCR corrected cure rate of 97% (95% CI 86-100) and 95% (95% CI 84-99) for AL and AS-AQ, respectively. The most frequent adverse event in both groups was asthenia. No mutations in the kelch-13 gene associated with artemisinin resistance were identified. All participants had completed microscopic parasite clearance by day 3 post-treatment.
   Conclusion: This study showed that AL and AS-AQ remain efficacious, well-tolerated, and are safe to treat uncomplicated malaria in children from Lambarene. However, a regular monitoring of efficacy and a study of molecular markers of drug resistance to artemisinin in field isolates is essential.

TI Optimization of an in vivo model to study immunity to Plasmodium
   falciparum pre-erythrocytic stages
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium is a key surface antigen that induces antibodies and T-cells, conferring immune protection in animal models and humans. However, much of the work on CSP and immunity has been developed based on studies using rodent or non-human primate CSP antigens, which may not be entirely translatable to CSP expressed by human malaria parasites, especially considering the host specificity of the different species.
   Methods: Using a genetically engineered strain of Plasmodium berghei that expresses luciferase, GFP and the Plasmodium falciparum orthologue of CSP, the effect of laboratory preparation, mosquito treatment and mouse factors on sporozoite infectivity was assessed using an in vivo bioluminescence assay on mice. This assay was compared with a PCR-based protection assay using an already described monoclonal antibody that can provide sterile protection against sporozoite challenge.
   Results: Bioluminescence assay demonstrated similar detection levels of the quantity and kinetics of liver-stage infection, compared to PCR-based detection. This assay was used to evaluate treatment of sporozoite and delivery method on mouse infectivity, as well as the effects of age, sex and strain of mice. Finally, this assay was used to test the protective capacity of monoclonal antibody AB317; results strongly recapitulate the findings of previous work on this antibody.
   Conclusions: The PbGFP-Luc line and in vivo bioluminescence imaging provide highly sensitive read-outs of liver-stage infection in mice, and this method can be useful to reliably evaluate potency of pre-erythrocytic interventions.

TI Markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Eastern Democratic
   Republic of Congo; implications for malaria chemoprevention
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is a cornerstone of malaria chemoprophylaxis and is considered for programmes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, SP efficacy is threatened by drug resistance, that is conferred by mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes. The World Health Organization has specified that intermittent preventive treatment for infants (IPTi) with SP should be implemented only if the prevalence of the dhps K540E mutation is under 50%. There are limited current data on the prevalence of resistance-conferring mutations available from Eastern DRC. The current study aimed to address this knowledge gap.
   Methods: Dried blood-spot samples were collected from clinically suspected malaria patients [outpatient department (OPD)] and pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) in four sites in North and South Kivu, DRC. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on samples from individuals with positive and with negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results. Dhps K450E and A581G and dhfr I164L were assessed by nested PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension and detection by multiplex bead-based assays.
   Results: Across populations, Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence was 47.9% (1160/2421) by RDT and 71.7 (1763/2421) by qPCR. Median parasite density measured by qPCR in RDT-negative qPCR-positive samples was very low with a median of 2.3 parasites/mu L (IQR 0.5-25.2). Resistance genotyping was successfully performed in RDT-positive samples and RDT-negative/qPCR-positive samples with success rates of 86.2% (937/1086) and 55.5% (361/651), respectively. The presence of dhps K540E was high across sites (50.3-87.9%), with strong evidence for differences between sites (p < 0.001). Dhps A581G mutants were less prevalent (12.7-47.2%). The dhfr I164L mutation was found in one sample.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of the SP resistance marker dhps K540E exceeds 50% in all four study sites in North and South Kivu, DRC. K540E mutations regularly co-occurred with mutations in dhps A581G but not with the dhfr I164L mutation. The current results do not support implementation of IPTi with SP in the study area.

TI High cases of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infections in a
   suburban population of Lagos, Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Asymptomatic malaria parasites are significant sources of infections for onward malaria transmission. Conventional tools for malaria diagnosis such as microscopy and rapid diagnostic test kits (RDT) have relatively low sensitivity, hence the need for alternative tools for active screening of such low-density infections.
   Methods: This study tested var acidic terminal sequence-based (varATS) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for screening asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections among dwellers of a sub-urban community in Lagos, Nigeria. Clinically healthy participants were screened for malaria using microscopy, RDT and varATS qPCR techniques. Participants were stratified into three age groups: 1-5, 6-14 and > 14 years old.
   Results: Of the 316 participants screened for asymptomatic malaria infection, 78 (24.68%) were positive by microscopy, 99 (31.33%) were positive by RDT and 112 (35.44%) by varATS qPCR. Participants aged 6-14 years had the highest prevalence of asymptomatic malaria, with geometric means of similar to 116 parasites/mu L and similar to 6689 parasites/mu L as detected by microscopy and varATS, respectively.
   Conclusion: This study has revealed high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in the study population, with varATS detecting additional sub-microscopic infections. The highest concentration of asymptomatic malaria was observed among school-age children between 6 and 14 years old. A large-scale screening to identify other potential hotspots of asymptomatic parasites in the country is recommended.

TI Elucidating cryptic dynamics of Theileria communities in African buffalo
   using a high-throughput sequencing informatics approach
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Increasing access to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is revolutionizing the life sciences. In disease ecology, NGS-based methods have the potential to provide higher-resolution data on communities of parasites found in individual hosts as well as host populations. Here, we demonstrate how a novel analytical method, utilizing high-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons, can be used to explore variation in blood-borne parasite (Theileria-Apicomplexa: Piroplasmida) communities of African buffalo at higher resolutions than has been obtained with conventional molecular tools. Results reveal temporal patterns of synchronized and opposite fluctuations of prevalence and relative abundance of Theileria spp. within the host population, suggesting heterogeneous transmission across taxa. Furthermore, we show that the community composition of Theileria spp. and their subtypes varies considerably between buffalo, with differences in composition reflected in mean and variance of overall parasitemia, thereby showing potential to elucidate previously unexplained contrasts in infection outcomes for host individuals. Importantly, our methods are generalizable as they can be utilized to describe blood-borne parasite communities in any host species. Furthermore, our methodological framework can be adapted to any parasite system given the appropriate genetic marker. The findings of this study demonstrate how a novel NGS-based analytical approach can provide fine-scale, quantitative data, unlocking opportunities for discovery in disease ecology.

TI Impact of vector control interventions on malaria transmission
   intensity, outdoor vector biting rates and Anopheles mosquito species
   composition in Tororo, Uganda
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) are widely recommended for the prevention of malaria in endemic regions. Data from human landing catches provide information on the impact of vector control on vector populations. Here, malaria transmission indoors and outdoors, before and after mass deployment of LLINs and IRS in Uganda was compared. Methods The study took place in Tororo district, a historically high transmission area where universal LLIN distribution was conducted in November 2013 and May 2017 and 6 rounds of IRS implemented from December 2014 to July 2018. Human landing catches were performed in 8 houses monthly from October 2011 to September 2012 (pre-intervention period) and every 4 weeks from November 2017 to October 2018 (post-intervention period). Mosquitoes were collected outdoors from 18:00 to 22:00 h and indoors from 18:00 to 06:00 h. Female Anopheles were tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites and species identification performed using gross dissection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results The interventions were associated with a decline in human biting rate from 19.6 to 2.3 female Anopheles mosquitoes per house per night (p < 0.001) and annual entomological inoculation rate from 129 to 0 infective bites per person per year (p < 0.001). The proportion of mosquitoes collected outdoors increased from 11.6 to 49.4% (p < 0.001). Prior to the interventions the predominant species was Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), which comprised an estimated 76.7% of mosquitoes. Following the interventions, the predominant species was Anopheles arabiensis, which comprised 99.5% of mosquitoes, with almost complete elimination of An. gambiae s.s. (0.5%). Conclusions Mass distribution of LLINs and 6 rounds of IRS dramatically decreased vector density and sporozoite rate resulting in a marked reduction in malaria transmission intensity in a historically high transmission site in Uganda. These changes were accompanied by a shift in vector species from An. gambiae s.s. to An. arabiensis and a relative increase in outdoor biting.

TI Genetic polymorphism of histidine rich protein 2 in Plasmodium
   falciparum isolates from different infection sources in Yunnan Province,
   China
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Failed diagnoses of some falciparum malaria cases by RDTs are constantly reported in recent years. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhpr2) gene deficiency has been found to be the major reason of RDTs failure in many countries. This article analysed the deletion of pfhpr2 gene of falciparum malaria cases isolated in Yunnan Province, China.
   Methods: Blood samples from falciparum malaria cases diagnosed in Yunnan Province were collected. Plasmodium genomic DNA was extracted and the pfhrp2 gene exon2 region was amplified via nested PCR. The haplotype of the DNA sequence, the nucleic acid diversity index (PI) and expected heterozygosity (He) were analyzed. Count PfHRP2 amino acid peptide sequence repeat and its times, and predict the properties of PfHRP2 peptide chain reaction to RDTs testing.
   Results: A total of 306 blood samples were collected, 84.9% (259/306) from which pfhrp2 PCR amplification products (gene exon2) were obtained, while the remaining 47 samples were false amplification. The length of the 250 DNA sequences ranged from 345 - 927 bp, with 151 haplotypes, with PI and He values of 0.169 and 0.983, respectively. The length of the PfHRP2 peptide chain translated from 250 DNA sequences ranged from 115 to 309 aa. All peptide chains had more than an amino acid codon deletion. All 250 PfHRP2 strands ended with a type 12 amino acid repeat, 98.0% (245/250) started with a type 1 repetition and 2.0% (5/250) with a type 2 repetition. The detection rate for type 2 duplicates was 100% (250/250). Prediction of RDT sensitivity of PfHRP2 peptide chains based on type 2 and type 7 repeats showed that 9.60% (24/250), 50.0% (125/250), 13.20% (33/250) and 27.20.5% (68/250) of the 250 peptide chains were very sensitive, sensitive, borderline and non-sensitive, respectively.
   Conclusion: The diversified polymorphism of the pfhrp2 gene deletion from different infection sources in the Yunnan province are extremely complex. The cause of the failure of pfhrp2 exon2 amplification is still to be investigated. The results of this study appeal to Yunnan Province for a timely evaluation of the effectiveness and applicability of RDTs in the diagnosis of malaria.

TI PCR correction strategies for malaria drug trials: updates and
   clarifications
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Malaria drug trials conducted in endemic areas face a major challenge in their analysis because it is difficult to establish whether parasitaemia in blood samples collected after treatment indicate drug failure or a new infection acquired after treatment. It is therefore vital to reliably distinguish drug failures from new infections in order to obtain accurate estimates of drug failure rates. This distinction can be achieved for Plasmodium falciparum by comparing parasite genotypes obtained at the time of treatment (the baseline) and on the day of recurring parasitaemia. Such PCR correction is required to obtain accurate failure rates, even for new effective drugs. Despite the routine use of PCR correction in surveillance of drug resistance and in clinical drug trials, limitations inherent to the molecular genotyping methods have led some researchers to question the validity of current PCR correction strategies. Here we describe and discuss recent developments in these genotyping approaches, with a particular focus on method validation and limitations of the genotyping strategies. Our aim is to update scientists from public and private bodies who are working on the development, deployment, and surveillance of new malaria drugs. We aim to promote discussion around these issues and argue for the adoption of improved standardised PCR correction methodologies.

TI Performance evaluation of different strategies based on microscopy
   techniques, rapid diagnostic test and molecular loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification assay for the diagnosis of imported malaria
SO CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB Objectives: Malaria is one of most common tropical diseases encountered in travellers and migrants. It requires an urgent and reliable diagnosis considering its potential severity. In this study, performance of five diagnostic assays were evaluated in a nonendemic region and compared prospectively to quantitative PCR (qPCR).
   Methods: A prospective study was conducted at Toulouse Hospital from August 2017 to January 2018 and included all patients with initial Plasmodium screening. Thin and thick blood smears (TnS, TkS), quantitative buffy coat (QBC), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were independently performed on each blood sample and compared to our qPCR reference standard.
   Results: The study encompassed 331 patients, mainly returning from Africa. qPCR detected 73 Plasmodium-positive samples (including 58 falciparum). Individually, LAMP had a 97.3% (71/73) sensitivity, far ahead of TnS (84.9%, 62/73), TkS (86.3%, 63/73), QBC (86.3%, 63/73) and RDT (86.3%, 63/73). RDT demonstrated a high sensitivity for falciparum (98.3%, 57/58) but missed all ovale, malariae and knowlesi infections. Specificity was excellent for all techniques (99.6-100%). The most sensitive diagnosis strategies were TnS thorn RDT (95.9%, 70/73), TnS thorn LAMP ( 97.3%, 71/73) and TnS thorn RDT thorn LAMP (100%, 73/73), about 10% higher than strategies using exclusively microscopy, TkS thorn TnS (87.7%, 64/73) or QBC thorn TnS (87.7%, 64/73). TnS remains necessary for Plasmodium species identification and quantification. Adding sequentially TnS only on LAMP-positive samples did not decrease TnS thorn LAMP strategy sensitivity.
   Conclusions: In nonendemic countries, the currently recommended microscopy-based strategies seem unsatisfactory for malaria diagnosis considering RDT and LAMP performance, two rapid and sensitive assays that require limited training.

TI Evaluation of PCR To Monitor Plasmodium falciparum Treatment Efficacy in
   a Nonendemicity Setting
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) after malaria treatment remains challenging to assess in settings of malaria nonendemicity. Biological evaluation of parasitological clearance relies on microscopic investigation of thick blood smears, which is a specific technique that not all diagnosis laboratories are able to perform. Rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) and molecular biology techniques are proposed as alternatives to microscope conventional techniques; however, their performance for treatment efficacy evaluation is controversial. We present here a retrospective comparative study for RDT and PCR (nested and high-resolution-melting quantitative PCR (HRM-qPCRII) evaluation of ACPR in a nonendemicity context. Blood samples from 133 patients presenting a Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection were included. Samples obtained at the time of diagnosis and at 3, 7, and 28 days after diagnosis were investigated. Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2)-based RDT results remained positive in 51% of cases 28 days after diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic management. Parasite DNA was detected by the two PCR techniques (nested PCR and HRMqPCR) in 12% and 10% of samples 28 days after treatment initiation, respectively. No therapeutic failure was recorded in the studied patients. Persistence of positive signal might reflect the presence of circulating asexual parasites or persistence of HRP-2 and parasitic DNA in patient's peripheral blood after parasitic clearance.

TI High Circulation of Malaria and Low Prevalence of Bacteremia in Febrile
   and Afebrile Children in Northeastern Gabon
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The epidemiology of febrile illness etiologies is under-explored in resource-poor settings. Establishing a local repertory of microorganisms circulating in blood of febrile and afebrile people is important for physicians. Blood was collected from 428 febrile and 88 afebrile children in Makokou (Gabon) and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction. Plasmodium spp. were the pathogens, which were most detected in febrile children (69.6%; 298/428) and in afebrile children (31.8%; 28/88) (P < 0.0001). Plasmodium falciparum was the most prevalent species in both febrile and afebrile children (66.8% and 27.3%, respectively). No differences were observed between febrile and afebrile children for Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale (8.2% versus 10.2% and 3.3% versus 3.4%, respectively). Triple infection with P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale was also detected in 1% of febrile children (4/428). Filariasis due to Mansonella perstans was detected in 10 febrile patients (2.3%), whereas Loa loa was detected in both febrile and afebrile children (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). Bacterial DNA was detected in only 4.4% (19/428) of febrile children, including 13 (68.4%) who were coinfected with at least one Plasmodium species. These were Haemophilus influenzae (1.6%, 7/428), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (1.2%, 5/428), and Rickettsia fells (0.9%, 4/428). Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., Tropheryma whipplei, Anaplasma spp., Leptospira spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella spp. were not detected. This study also highlights the over-prescription and the overuse of antibiotics and antimalarials. Overall, malaria remains a major health problem in Makokou. Malaria control measures must be reconsidered in this region.

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium spp. in the Amazonian Border Context (French
   Guiana-Brazil): Associated Factors and Spatial Distribution
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB To implement future malaria elimination strategies in French Guiana, a characterization of the infectious reservoir is recommended. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October and December 2017 in the French Guianese municipality of St Georges de l'Oyapock, located along the Brazilian border. The prevalence of Plasmodium spp. was determined using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic, house locations, medical history, and biological data were analyzed. Factors associated with Plasmodium spp. carriage were analyzed using logistic regression, and the carriage localization was investigated through spatial cluster analysis. Of the 1,501 samples analyzed with PCR, positive results totaled 90 and 10 for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, respectively. The general PCR prevalence was 6.6% [5.3-7.9], among which 74% were asymptomatic. Only 13/1,549 were positive by RDT. In multivariate analysis, participants older than 15 years, living in a remote neighborhood, with a prior history of malaria, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were associated with an increased odds of Plasmodium spp. carriage. High-risk clusters of P. vivax carriage were detected in the most remote neighborhoods on the village outskirts and two small foci in the village center. We also detected a hot spot for both P. vivax and P. falciparum symptomatic carriers in the northwestern part of the village. The present study confirms a wide-scale presence of asymptomatic P. falciparum and P. vivax carriers in this area. Although they were more often located in remote areas, their geographic distribution was spatially heterogeneous and complex.

TI Asymptomatic falciparum Malaria and its Effects on Type 2 Diabetes
   Mellitus Patients in Lagos, Nigeria
SO SAUDI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB Background: Asymptomatic malaria (ASM) constitutes a reservoir of malaria parasites that sustain transmission and threaten elimination efforts. Studies have also shown a significant relation between insulin resistance and malaria infection. However, data on the clinical effects of ASM and its patterns of carriage among adult malaria patients is limited.
   Objectives: To determine the prevalence of ASM due to Plasmodium falciparum among adult type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients in Lagos, Nigeria; to assess the diagnostic performance of light microscopy and histidine-rich protein 2 rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2 RDT); and to determine the effects of ASM on glycemic control and anemia.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 208 afebrile, nonobese, nonhypertensive T2DM patients, aged 40-70 years, undergoing treatment (adherence, >= 95%) at six private health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria, between March and August 2015. Sociodemographic data were obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire and clinical case files. Venous blood samples were collected and processed for fasting blood sugar estimation, packed cell volume determination and malaria parasite detection by HRP2-RDT, light microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 54.5 years. ASM was diagnosed in 16.8%, 7.2% and 4.3% of the patients by PCR, light microscopy and HRP2-RDT, respectively. ASM was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with poor glycemic control, anemia and insulin resistance. The overall parasitemia ranged from 85 to 3789 parasites/mu L (median, 1580 parasites/mu L). Benchmarking against the PCR results, light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests were found to have a sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 42.9% (26.5-59.3) and 22.9% (12.1-39), respectively, in diagnosing ASM.
   Conclusion: This study revealed that T2DM patients in Lagos, Nigeria, are potential reservoirs of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum, which has a significantly negative effect on glycemic control and anemia. The study also found PCR to be the most effective diagnostic method.

TI Trends in Molecular Markers Associated with Resistance to
   Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) Among Plasmodium falciparum Isolates on
   Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea: 2011-2017
SO INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB Purpose: Antimalarial drug resistance is one of the major challenges in global efforts to control and eliminate malaria. In 2006, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) replaced with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, in response to increasing SP resistance, which is associated with mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps) genes.
   Patients and Methods: To evaluate the trend of molecular markers associated with SP resistance on Bioko Island from 2011 to 2017, 179 samples collected during active case detection were analysed by PCR and DNA sequencing.
   Results: Pfdhfr and Pfdhps gene sequences were obtained for 90.5% (162/179) and 77.1% (138/179) of the samples, respectively. For Pfdhfr, 97.5% (158/162), 95.7% (155/162) and 98.1% (159/162) of the samples contained N51I, C59R and S108N mutant alleles, respectively. And Pfdhps S436A, A437G, K540E, A581G, and A613S mutations were observed in 25.4% (35/138), 88.4% (122/138), 5.1% (7/138), 1.4% (2/138), and 7.2% (10/138) of the samples, respectively. Two classes of previously described Pfdhfr-Pfdhps haplotypes associated with SP resistance and their frequencies were identified: partial (IRNI-SGKAA, 59.4%) and full (IRNI-SGEAA, 5.5%) resistance. Although no significant difference was observed in different time periods (p>0.05), our study confirmed a slowly increasing trend of the frequencies of these SP-resistance markers in Bioko parasites over the 7 years investigated.
   Conclusion: The findings reveal the general existence of SP-resistance markers on Bioko Island even after the replacement of SP as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Continuous molecular monitoring and additional control efforts in the region are urgently needed.

TI Swapping of The N-Terminal Domain of Human Topoisomerase 1B with the
   Corresponding Plasmodium Falciparum Counterpart Strongly Impairs Enzyme
   Activity
SO REPORTS OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Background: DNA topoisomerases 1B are a class of ubiquitous enzyme that solves the topological problems associated with biological processes such as replication, transcription and recombination. Numerous sequence alignment of topoisomerase 1B from different species shows that the lengths of different domains as well as their amino acids sequences are quite different. In the present study a hybrid enzyme, generated by swapping the N-terminal of Plasmodium falciparum into the corresponding domain of the human, has been characterized.
   Methods: The chimeric enzyme was generated using different sets of PCR. The in vitro characterization was carried out using different DNA substrate including radio-labelled oligonucleotides.
   Results: The chimeric enzyme displayed slower relaxation activity, cleavage and re-ligation kinetics strongly perturbed when compared to the human enzyme.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that the N-terminal domain has a crucial role in modulating topoisomerase activity in different species.

TI Comparison of Different 18S rRNA Primers with Conventional PCR Methods
   in Determination of Plasmodium spp. and Evaluation of Nested PCR Method
SO JOURNAL OF BASIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH SCIENCES
AB Purpose: In this study, our objective was to develop a conventional PCR method in our laboratory to support microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests in routine diagnosis of malaria. For this purpose, by comparing two different primer sets, it was aimed to determine which primer set gave better results in diagnosis and to use this primer set in future studies.
   Methods: Microscopic examination is the gold standard for diagnosis of Plasmodium infections. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional PCR method, which was based on two different primer sets with a common gene region, were calculated. Afterward, nested PCR were performed for species differentiation using PCR products obtained with both primer pairs.
   Results: 165 of 168 blood samples (98.21%), which were microscopically Plasmodium vivax positive, were also positive with rPLU1, rPLU5 primers. Furthermore, 163 of these samples (97.02%) were also positive with rPLU5, rPLU6 primers. In addition, to evaluate whether the method detected all species, PCR was carried out with all species positive samples for both primer pairs. Comparison with microscopic examination showed that sensitivity and specificity of rPLU1 and rPLU5 primer pairs were 98.21% and 100%, respectively while sensitivity and specificity of rPLU5 and rPLU6 primer pairs were 97.02% and 100%, respectively. We found a perfect consistency between microscopy and PCR results with both primer sets.
   Conclusion: Although there was no significant difference between two primer pairs, which provided better results for cases required a conventional first step PCR method during routine laboratory practice, we decided to prefer rPLU1 and rPLU5 primer pair.

TI Molecular Characterization of msp-1 and msp-2 among Plasmodium
   falciparum-infected Children: A Gene Polymorphisms analysis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum's biodiversity still seems to be argumentative, and hinders malaria control, the current study aimed to characterize P. falciparum isolates for genetic markers polymorphism of (msp-1(k1 and ro33) and (msp-2 (FC27 and 3D7)) among malaria-infected Sudanese children. Methods: A total of 100 blood samples from patients were collected from April to August 2019. Blood films and PCR confirmed P. falciparum mono-infections and following gel electrophoresis of DNA products from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) targeting msp-1 diversity (K1 and ro33) and merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2 (FC27 and 3D7)), the analysis of genetic diversity of P. falciparum was carried out by length polymorphism. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Among 100 patients were enrolled there were 43% in age group 5 - 10 years and the majority of children were female (65%), the mean of parasite density was (57.320 parasites/ml). The analysis revealed strong allelic diversity, as distinct allelic from 23 and 18 were respectively detected in msp 1 and msp 2 in participants with complicated malaria attack, while only 14, 12 allelic from in msp 1 and msp 2 in participants with uncomplicated malaria attack. At each locus, family distribution in patients with uncomplicated malaria was significantly 17%, and 40% for Kl, and RO33 of msp-1 respectively (P. value, 0.03/CI= 2.700). Conclusion: The study concludes that there is high genetic diversity and allelic distribution revealed among the Sudanese population. Even though the used approach had limits, this research demonstrates high polymorphisms in Khartoum state with 23 and18 different alleles of MSP 1 and MSP 2 respectively. The frequency of Klallele in MSP1 of plasmodium falciparum in malaria patients is significantly more predominant than the frequency of the RO33 allele in malaria patients samples, and it correlates with server malaria.

TI Upsurge of malaria transmission after indoor residual spraying
   withdrawal in Atacora region in Benin, West Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background In Benin, malaria vector control mostly relies on long-lasting, insecticidal-treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) operations. From 2011 to 2016, an IRS programme has been implemented in Atacora region. However, in 2017 the programme was withdrawn from two other regions in the northern part of the country, with hopes that gains would be relatively sustained because of the seasonality of malaria transmission. What would be the vulnerability of populations to malaria after the withdrawal of IRS? Methods Monthly mosquito collections were performed through human landing captures (HLCs) for 24 months (from January to December 2016 during the last IRS campaign, and from January to December 2018, 2 years after the withdrawal of IRS). Vector mosquitoes biting density was sampled by HLC and was tested for presence of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. The carcass of these mosquitoes (abdomens, wing, legs) were subjected to molecular species identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Results It is noticed a drastic increase (similar to 3 times higher) of vector abundance after the withdrawal of IRS. Mosquito biting rates in the 3 survey districts increased significantly after IRS was withdrawn. In 2018, after IRS cessation a significant increase of entomological inoculation rate was recorded, where each inhabitant received an average of 94.9 infected bites/year to 129.21 infected bites/year against an average of 17.15 infected bites/year to 24.82 infected bites/year in 2016. Conclusion It is obvious that the withdrawal of IRS confers a vulnerability of the population with regard to the malaria transmission. Robust monitoring is needed to better understand when and where IRS should be most adequate, or can be safely withdrawn. In case of withdrawal, adapted accompanying measures should be proposed according to the context not only to maintain the gains capitalized with IRS, but also to avoid any rebound of transmission.

TI The use of ultrasensitive quantitative-PCR to assess the impact of
   primaquine on asymptomatic relapse of Plasmodium vivax infections: a
   randomized, controlled trial in Lao PDR
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Trials to assess the efficacy of the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria with 8-aminoquinolines require that most post-treatment relapses are identified, but there is no consensus on the optimal duration of follow-up in either symptomatic or asymptomatic vivax malaria. The efficacy of a 14-day course of primaquine on the cumulative incidence of recurrent asymptomatic P. vivax infections detected by ultrasensitive quantitative PCR (uPCR) as a primary endpoint was assessed. Methods A randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind trial was conducted in four villages of the Lao PDR during 2016-2018 nested in a larger project evaluating mass drug administrations (MDA) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and a single low-dose primaquine to clear Plasmodium falciparum infections. In the nested sub-study, eligible participants with mono- or mixed P. vivax infections detected by uPCR were randomized to receive either 14 days of primaquine (0.5 mg/kg/day) or placebo during the last round of MDA (round 3) through directly observed therapy. Participants were checked monthly for 12 months for parasitaemia using uPCR. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of participants with at least one recurrent episode of P. vivax infection. Results 20 G6PD-normal participants were randomized in each arm. 5 (29%) of 20 participants in the placebo arm experienced asymptomatic, recurrent P. vivax infections, resulting in a cumulative incidence at month 12 of 29%. None of the 20 participants in the intervention arm had recurrent infections (p = 0.047 Fisher's exact test). Participants with recurrent P. vivax infections were found to be parasitaemic for between one and five sequential monthly tests. The median time to recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia was 178 days (range 62-243 days). Conclusions A 14-day course of primaquine in addition to a DP-MDA was safe, well-tolerated, and prevented recurrent asymptomatic P. vivax infections. Long follow-up for up to 12 months is required to capture all recurrences following the treatment of asymptomatic vivax infection. To eliminate all malarias in settings where P. vivax is endemic, a full-course of an 8-aminoquinolines should be added to MDA to eliminate all malarias. Trial registration This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT02802813 on 16th June 2016.

TI In vivo/ex vivo efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and
   artesunate-amodiaquine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated
   falciparum malaria in children: an open label randomized controlled
   trial in Burkina Faso
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundArtemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is recommended to improve malaria treatment efficacy and limit drug-resistant parasites selection in malaria endemic areas. 5 years after they were adopted, the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), the first-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria were assessed in Burkina Faso.MethodsIn total, 440 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomized to receive either AL or ASAQ for 3 days and were followed up weekly for 42 days. Blood samples were collected to investigate the ex vivo susceptibility of P. falciparum isolates to lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin (the active metabolite of artemisinin derivatives) and monodesethylamodiaquine (the active metabolite of amodiaquine). The modified isotopic micro test technique was used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Primary endpoints were the risks of treatment failure at days 42.ResultsOut of the 440 patients enrolled, 420 (95.5%) completed the 42 days follow up. The results showed a significantly higher PCR unadjusted cure rate in ASAQ arm (71.0%) than that in the AL arm (49.8%) on day 42, and this trend was similar after correction by PCR, with ASAQ performing better (98.1%) than AL (91.1%). Overall adverse events incidence was low and not significantly different between the two treatment arms. Ex vivo results showed that 6.4% P. falciparum isolates were resistant to monodesthylamodiaquine. The coupled in vivo/ex vivo analysis showed increased IC50 values for lumefantrine and monodesethylamodiaquine at day of recurrent parasitaemia compared to baseline values while for artesunate, IC50 values remained stable at baseline and after treatment failure (p>0.05).ConclusionThese findings provide substantial evidence that AL and ASAQ are highly efficacious for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children in Burkina Faso. However, the result of P. falciparum susceptibility to the partner drugs advocates the need to regularly replicate such surveillance studies. This would be particularly indicated when amodiaquine is associated in seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (SMC) mass drug administration in children under 5 years in Burkina Faso.Trial registration clinicaltrials, NCT00808951.

TI Quantification of malaria antigens PfHRP2 and pLDH by quantitative
   suspension array technology in whole blood, dried blood spot and plasma
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria diagnostics by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) relies primarily on the qualitative detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and Plasmodium spp lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). As novel RDTs with increased sensitivity are being developed and implemented as point of care diagnostics, highly sensitive laboratory-based assays are needed for evaluating RDT performance. Here, a quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) was developed, validated and applied for the simultaneous detection of PfHRP2 and pLDH in a variety of biological samples (whole blood, plasma and dried blood spots) from individuals living in different endemic countries. Results The qSAT was specific for the target antigens, with analytical ranges of 6.8 to 762.8 pg/ml for PfHRP2 and 78.1 to 17076.6 pg/ml for P. falciparum LDH (Pf-LDH). The assay detected Plasmodium vivax LDH (Pv-LDH) at a lower sensitivity than Pf-LDH (analytical range of 1093.20 to 187288.5 pg/ml). Both PfHRP2 and pLDH levels determined using the qSAT showed to positively correlate with parasite densities determined by quantitative PCR (Spearman r = 0.59 and 0.75, respectively) as well as microscopy (Spearman r = 0.40 and 0.75, respectively), suggesting the assay to be a good predictor of parasite density. Conclusion This immunoassay can be used as a reference test for the detection and quantification of PfHRP2 and pLDH, and could serve for external validation of RDT performance, to determine antigen persistence after parasite clearance, as well as a complementary tool to assess malaria burden in endemic settings.

TI Anti-MSP-10 IgG indicates recent exposure to Plasmodium vivax infection
   in the Peruvian Amazon
SO JCI INSIGHT
AB BACKGROUND. Serological tools for the accurate detection of recent malaria exposure are needed to guide and monitor malaria control efforts. IgG responses against Plasmodium vivox and P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-10 (MSP10) were measured as a potential way to identify recent malaria exposure in the Peruvian Amazon.
   METHODS. A field-based study included 470 participants in a longitudinal cohort who completed a comprehensive evaluation: light microscopy and PCR on enrollment, at least 1 monthly follow-up by light microscopy, a second PCR, and serum and dried blood spots for serological analysis at the end of the follow-up. IgG titers against novel mammalian cell-produced recombinant PvMSP10 and PfMSP10 were determined by ELISA.
   RESULTS. During the follow-up period, 205 participants were infected, including 171 with P. vivox, 26 with P. falciparum, 6 with infections by both species but at different times, and 2 with mixed infections. Exposure to P. vivax was more accurately identified when serological responses to PvMSP10 were obtained from serum (sensitivity, 58.1%; specificity, 81.8%; AUC: 0.76) than from dried blood spots (sensitivity, 35.2; specificity, 83.5%; AUC: 0.64) (P-AUC < 0.001). Sensitivity was highest (serum, 82.9%; dried blood spot, 45.7%) with confirmed P. vivax infections occurring 7-30 days before sample collection; sensitivity decreased significantly in relation to time since last documented infection. PvMSP10 serological data did not show evidence of interspecies cross-reactivity. Anti- PfMSP10 responses poorly discriminated between P. falciparum-exposed and nonexposed individuals (AUC = 0.59; P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION. Anti-PvMSP10 IgG indicates recent exposure to P. vivax at the population level in the Amazon region. Serum, not dried blood spots, should be used for such serological tests.

TI Use of a highly-sensitive rapid diagnostic test to screen for malaria in
   pregnancy in Indonesia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria is inadequate for detecting low-density, often asymptomatic infections, such as those that can occur when screening pregnant women for malaria. The performance of the Alere (TM) Ultra-sensitive Malaria Ag Plasmodium falciparum RDT (uRDT) was assessed retrospectively in pregnant women in Indonesia. Methods The diagnostic performance of the uRDT and the CareStart (TM) Malaria HRP2/pLDH VOM (Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae) Combo RDT (csRDT) were assessed using 270 stored red blood cell pellets and plasma samples from asymptomatic pregnant women. These included 112 P. falciparum negative and 158 P. falciparum positive samples detected by a composite test (qPCR, LAMP, nPCR) as reference standard. Diagnostic indicators: sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and the level of agreement (kappa) were calculated for comparison. Results Compared with the reference test, the uRDT had a sensitivity of 19.6% (95% CI 13.9-26.8) and specificity of 98.2% (93.1-99.7%). The csRDT was 22.8% (16.7-30.3) sensitive and 95.5% (89.4-98.3) specific for P. falciparum infections. Performance of the uRDT was non-significantly different to the csRDT (p = 0.169). RDT outcome was stratified by qPCR cycling threshold (Ct), and performance of the RDTs was found to be comparable across parasite loads. Conclusion The uRDT performed similarly to the currently used csRDTs in detecting P. falciparum infections in asymptomatic pregnant women. In these settings, molecular diagnostics are currently the most sensitive for malaria.

TI Plasma levels of interleukin 27 in falciparum malaria is increased
   independently of co-infection with HIV: potential immune-regulatory role
   during malaria
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background The immune response during falciparum malaria mediates both harmful and protective effects on the host; however the participating molecules have not been fully defined. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine exerting both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, but data on IL-27 in malaria patients are scarce. Methods Clinical data and blood samples were collected from adults in Mozambique with P. falciparum infection, with (n = 70) and without (n = 61) HIV-1 co-infection, from HIV-infected patients with similar symptoms without malaria (n = 58) and from healthy controls (n = 52). In vitro studies were performed in endothelial cells and PBMC using hemozoin crystals. Samples were analyzed using enzyme immunoassays and quantitative PCR. Results (i) IL-27 was markedly up-regulated in malaria patients compared with controls and HIV-infected patients without malaria, showing no relation to HIV co-infection. (ii) IL-27 was correlated with P. falciparum parasitemia and von Willebrand factor as a marker of endothelial activation, but not with disease severity. (iii) In vitro, IL-27 modulated the hemozoin-mediated cytokine response in endothelial cells and PBMC with enhancing effects on IL-6 and attenuating effects on IL-8. Conclusion Our findings show that IL-27 is regulated during falciparum malaria, mediating both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, potentially playing an immune-regulatory role during falciparum malaria.

TI Identification of Plasmodium Species by Multiplex PCR in a Single Tube
   Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
AB BACKGROUND
   Epidemiological studies based on molecular methods for identification of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum is gaining importance, because the conventional methods like microscopy, cannot detect low-level parasitaemia and mixed infections. Even though different types of laboratory investigations for diagnosing malaria-like rapid antigen detection and QBC were developed, still there are some negative interpretations among convalescent cases identified in endemic areas. These issues can be overcome by using molecular techniques like multiplex PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR. Among these methods real-time PCR has been shown to be more sensitive in studying the epidemiology of malaria. We wanted to standardize Multiplex PCR for the identification of Plasmodium species in a single reaction mix.
   METHODS
   A total of 52 blood samples were collected from suspected cases of clinical malaria which were tested for microscopy by using Leishman's stain and confirmed by conventional and multiplex PCR. Standardization of multiplex PCR for the identification of Plasmodium species in a single reaction mix was done for the diagnosis of malaria.
   RESULTS
   Out of 52 blood samples collected, about 38 (73.08 %) samples were confirmed with a multiplex PCR technique and only 34 (65.38 %) by microscopy. The four samples negative by microscopy were found to be Plasmodium falciparum. A significant correlation was found with the positive samples by conventional and standardized multiplex PCR.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Multiplex PCR is more useful for accurate diagnosis and epidemiological study for the detection of various species of the genus Plasmodium in a single-step reaction.

TI Molecular methods for tracking residual Plasmodium falciparum
   transmission in a close-to-elimination setting in Zanzibar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Molecular detection of low-density Plasmodium falciparum infections is essential for surveillance studies conducted to inform malaria control strategies in close-to-elimination settings. Molecular monitoring of residual malaria infections usually requires a large study size, therefore sampling and diagnostic processes need to be economical and optimized for high-throughput. A method comparison was undertaken to identify the most efficient diagnostic procedure for processing large collections of community samples with optimal test sensitivity, simplicity, and minimal costs. Methods In a reactive case detection study conducted on Zanzibar, parasitaemia of 4590 individuals of all ages was investigated by a highly sensitive quantitative (q) PCR that targets multiple var gene copies per parasite genome. To reduce cost, a first round of positivity screening was performed on pools of dried blood spots from five individuals. Ten cycles of a pre-PCR were performed directly on the filter paper punches, followed by qPCR. In a second round, samples of positive pools were individually analysed by pre-PCR and qPCR. Results Prevalence in household members and neighbors of index cases was 1.7% (78/4590) with a geometric mean parasite density of 58 parasites/mu l blood. Using qPCR as gold standard, diagnostic sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was 37% (29/78). Infections positive by qPCR but negative by RDT had mean densities of 15 parasites/mu l blood. Conclusion The approach of pre-screening reactive case detection samples in pools of five was ideal for a low prevalence setting such as in Zanzibar. Performing direct PCR on filter paper punches saves substantial time and justifies the higher cost for a polymerase suitable for amplifying DNA directly from whole blood. Molecular monitoring in community samples provided a more accurate picture of infection prevalence, as it identified a potential reservoir of infection that was largely missed by RDT. The developed qPCR-based methodology for screening large sample sets represents primarily a research tool that should inform the design of malaria elimination strategies. It may also prove beneficial for diagnostic tasks in surveillance-response activities.

TI Molecular epidemiology of malaria parasite amongst patients in a
   displaced people's camp in Sudan
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB Background Despite the importance of epidemiological studies in the development of effective control strategies and provision of basic health services for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), data on the prevalence of malaria are limited. Thus, this study was conducted to estimate the molecular prevalence of malaria amongst the displaced population in Ardamata IDP camp in Al-Geneina City, Sudan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2018 to December 2018 to estimate malaria prevalence amongst the displaced population in Ardamata IDP camp in Al-Geneina City, Sudan. A total of 380 patients with suspected malaria were recruited. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assays were performed to detect the Plasmodium genus and species. Results Of 380 patients, 232 (61.1%) were positive for malaria. Plasmodium falciparum was the only prevalent species detected amongst the study population. nPCR analysis revealed that none of the samples had Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae. The malaria prevalence rate was higher amongst males (67.1%) than in females (56.8%), and gender was the only risk factor that was significantly associated with malaria infection (p = .042). Conclusions Despite control programmes, malaria remains a significant cause of illness amongst a displaced population. The high prevalence of malaria infection in this study indicates that additional health facilities and control strategies should be implemented in displaced camps and the surrounding areas.

TI Influence of house characteristics on mosquito distribution and malaria
   transmission in the city of Yaounde, Cameroon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Improving house structure is known to limit contact between humans and mosquitoes and reduce malaria transmission risk. In the present study, the influence of house characteristics on mosquito distribution and malaria transmission risk was assessed in the city of Yaounde. Methods The study was conducted from March 2017 to June 2018 in 32 districts of the city of Yaounde. Mosquito collections were performed indoor in 10 to 15 houses per district using CDC light traps. A total of 467 houses, selected randomly were used. A pretested questionnaire was submitted to participants of the study to collect information on the household: the number of people per house, education level, type of walls, presence of ceilings and eaves, number of windows, usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), number of bedroom and number of window. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically. Anophelines were tested by ELISA to detect infection by Plasmodium parasites. General Estimating Equations adjusting for repeated measures in the same house fitting negative binomial analysis were used to assess the influence of house characteristics on mosquito distribution. Results A total of 168,039 mosquitoes were collected; Culex spp emerged as the predominant species (96.48%), followed by Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) (2.49%). Out of the 1033 An. gambiae s.l. identified by PCR, 90.03% were Anopheles coluzzii and the remaining were An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) (9.97%). The high number of people per household, the presence of screens on window and the possession of LLINs were all associated with fewer mosquitoes collected indoors, whilst opened eaves, the high number of windows, the presence of holes in walls and living close to breeding sites were associated with high densities of mosquitoes indoor. Out of 3557 Anophelines tested using ELISA CSP, 80 were found infected by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The proportion of mosquitoes infected did not vary significantly according to house characteristics. Conclusion The study indicated that several house characteristics such as, the presence of holes on walls, opened eaves, unscreened window and living close to breeding sites, favored mosquito presence in houses. Promoting frequent use of LLINs and house improvement measures, such as the use of screen on windows, closing eaves, cleaning the nearby environment, should be integrated in strategies to improve malaria control in the city of Yaounde.

TI The extended recovery ring-stage survival assay provides a superior
   association with patient clearance half-life and increases throughput
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Tracking and understanding artemisinin resistance is key for preventing global setbacks in malaria eradication efforts. The ring-stage survival assay (RSA) is the current gold standard for in vitro artemisinin resistance phenotyping. However, the RSA has several drawbacks: it is relatively low throughput, has high variance due to microscopy readout, and correlates poorly with the current benchmark for in vivo resistance, patient clearance half-life post-artemisinin treatment. Here a modified RSA is presented, the extended Recovery Ring-stage Survival Assay (eRRSA), using 15 cloned patient isolates from Southeast Asia with a range of patient clearance half-lives, including parasite isolates with and without kelch13 mutations. Methods Plasmodium falciparum cultures were synchronized with single layer Percoll during the schizont stage of the intraerythrocytic development cycle. Cultures were left to reinvade to early ring-stage and parasitaemia was quantified using flow cytometry. Cultures were diluted to 2% haematocrit and 0.5% parasitaemia in a 96-well plate to start the assay, allowing for increased throughput and decreased variability between biological replicates. Parasites were treated with 700 nM of dihydroartemisinin or 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 6 h, washed three times in drug-free media, and incubated for 66 or 114 h, when samples were collected and frozen for PCR amplification. A SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR method was used to quantify the fold-change between treated and untreated samples. Results 15 cloned patient isolates from Southeast Asia with a range of patient clearance half-lives were assayed using the eRRSA. Due to the large number of pyknotic and dying parasites at 66 h post-exposure (72 h sample), parasites were grown for an additional cell cycle (114 h post-exposure, 120 h sample), which drastically improved correlation with patient clearance half-life compared to the 66 h post-exposure sample. A Spearman correlation of - 0.8393 between fold change and patient clearance half-life was identified in these 15 isolates from Southeast Asia, which is the strongest correlation reported to date. Conclusions eRRSA drastically increases the efficiency and accuracy of in vitro artemisinin resistance phenotyping compared to the traditional RSA, which paves the way for extensive in vitro phenotyping of hundreds of artemisinin resistant parasites.

TI Performance of Ultrasensitive Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Detecting
   Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Proposed interventions for eliminating drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria include the targeting of asymptomatic carriers through screening and treatment. We report on the diagnostic performance of the recently developed ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) compared with screening with conventional RDTs (cRDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under field conditions in Cambodia in a total of 2,729 individuals. The P. falciparum positivity by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was 3.8% (26/678) in those screened during active case detection and 0.5% (10/2,051) in the cross-sectional survey. Compared with qPCR, the sensitivity of the uRDTs was 53.8% (95% CI: 33.4-73.4%) when used in active case detection and 60.0%(95% CI: 26.2-87.8%) in the cross-sectional survey. The uRDTs did not show a significant improvement in diagnostic performance over cRDTs when used for active case detection and for a malaria prevalence survey in the context of this low-transmission setting.

TI Association between the Phenotypes and Genotypes of Antimicrobial
   Resistance in Haemophilus parasuis Isolates from Swine in Quang Binh and
   Thua Thien Hue Provinces, Vietnam
SO ENGINEERING
AB Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) is one of the bacterial pathogens of great concern as it causes huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. One of the reasons why the control of H. parasuis has failed is the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The country of Vietnam has the second-largest pig production in Asia. However, there is still a lack of data about the AMR prevalence of H. parasuis in Vietnam. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of AMR and analyze the association between AMR and AMR genes (ARGs). The H. parasuis strains used in this research were isolated from swine in the Quang Binh and Thua Thien Hue Provinces, Central Vietnam, as reported in our previous study. All of the strains were tested for AMR against 25 antibacterial agents using the broth microdilution method and for the presence of ARGs using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The tested strains were shown to have a high frequency of resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (94.6%), followed by resistance to colistin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, penicillin, lincomycin, and amoxicillin. The most prevalent ARGs in these strains were bla(TEM-1) (94.6%), int (76.8%), gyrA (58.9%), and rmtD (50.0%). Cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, and tobramycin resistances were strongly correlated with the presence of the ARGs bla(ROB-1) (odds ratio (OR) = 26.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-255.7, p = 0.002), catl (OR = 25.1, 95% CI 2.4-258.9, p = 0.004), and strB (OR = 23.5, 95% CI 2.6-212.6, p = 0.001), respectively. This study reveals for the first time the current situation of H. parasuis AMR in Central Vietnam, which is helpful for the clinical control of this disease, as well as for the development of policies and clinical practice guidelines to reduce AMR in swine production in Central Vietnam.

TI The enigmatic mechanisms by which Plasmodium vivax infects
   Duffy-negative individuals
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The absence of the Duffy protein at the surface of erythrocytes was considered for decades to confer full protection against Plasmodium vivax as this blood group is the receptor for the key parasite ligand P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP). However, it is now clear that the parasite is able to break through this protection and induce clinical malaria in Duffy-negative people, although the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, we briefly review the evidence of Duffy-negative infections by P. vivax and summarize the current hypothesis at the basis of this invasion process. We discuss those in the perspective of malaria-elimination challenges, notably in African countries.
   Author summary
   Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread of the parasite species causing human malaria. It was considered for decades to be almost absent from sub-Saharan African countries because the majority of people in these areas lack a red blood cell receptor, the Duffy protein, which is the critical gateway for the parasite's entry into erythrocytes. In the last years, this dogma has been challenged by an increasing number of observations of P. vivax clinical infections into Duffy-negative people (individuals lacking the Duffy receptor) in many African countries as well as in South America where a significant number of people of African descent are also Duffy-negative. However, we still do not know how P. vivax is able to infect those individuals. Understanding how this invasion takes place will be critical for the implementation of adapted control solutions targeting this parasite species in order to achieve malaria elimination, especially in African countries where tremendous decline in the prevalence of the other major human malaria species, P. falciparum, has been achieved in the past decade.

TI Diagnosis and Molecular Analysis on Imported Plasmodium ovale curtisi
   and P. ovale wallikeri Malaria Cases from West and South Africa during
   2013-2016
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Majority of the imported malaria cases in Korea is attributed to Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections, whereas P. malariae and P. ovale infections are very rare. Falciparum and ovale malaria are mostly imported from Africa, while most of the vivax malaria cases are imported from Southeast Asia. Here, we report 6 Korean imported ovale malaria cases (4 males and 2 females) who had visited in Africa during 2013-2016. These subjects were diagnosed with P ovale based on microscopic findings, Plasmodium species-specific nested-PCR, and phylogenetic Glade using 18S rRNA gene sequences. We identified 2 P. ovale subtypes, 1 P. ovale curtisi (classic type) and 5 P. ovale wallikeri (variant type). All patients were treated with chloroquine and primaquine, and no relapse or recrudescence was reported for 1 year after treatment. With increase of travelers to the countries where existing Plasmodium species, the risk of Plasmodium infection is also increasing. Molecular monitoring for imported malaria parasites should be rigorously and continuously performed to enable diagnosis and certification of Plasmodium spp.

TI Plasmodium knowlesi Malaria in Sabah, Malaysia, 2015-2017: Ongoing
   Increase in Incidence Despite Near-elimination of the Human-only
   Plasmodium Species
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Malaysia aims to eliminate malaria by 2020. However, while cases of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax have decreased substantially, the incidence of zoonotic malaria from Plasmodium knowlesi continues to increase, presenting a major challenge to regional malaria control efforts. Here we report incidence of all Plasmodium species in Sabah, including zoonotic P. knowlesi, during 2015-2017.
   Methods. Microscopy-based malaria notification data and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were obtained from the Sabah Department of Health and State Public Health Laboratory, respectively, from January 2015 to December 2017. From January 2016 this was complemented by a statewide prospective hospital surveillance study. Databases were matched, and species was determined by PCR, or microscopy if PCR was not available.
   Results. A total of 3867 malaria cases were recorded between 2015 and 2017, with PCR performed in 93%. Using PCR results, and microscopy if PCR was unavailable, P. knowlesi accounted for 817 (80%), 677 (88%), and 2030 (98%) malaria cases in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. P. falciparum accounted for 110 (11%), 45 (6%), and 23 (1%) cases and P. vivax accounted for 61 (6%), 17 (2%), and 8 (0.4%) cases, respectively. Of those with P. knowlesi, the median age was 35 (interquartile range: 24-47) years, and 85% were male.
   Conclusions. Malaysia is approaching elimination of the human-only Plasmodium species. However, the ongoing increase in P. knowlesi incidence presents a major challenge to malaria control and warrants increased focus on knowlesi-specific prevention activities. Wider molecular surveillance in surrounding countries is required.

TI Efficient Transmission of Mixed Plasmodium falciparum/vivax Infections
   From Humans to Mosquitoes
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. In Southeast Asia, people are often coinfected with different species of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum [pf] and Plasmodium vivax [Pv]) as well as with multiple clones of the same species. Whether particular species or clones within mixed infections are more readily transmitted to mosquitoes remains unknown.
   Methods. Laboratory-reared Anopheles dirus were fed on blood from 119 Pf-infected Cambodian adults, with 5950 dissected to evaluate for transmitted infection. Among 12 persons who infected mosquitoes, polymerase chain reaction and amplicon deep sequencing were used to track species and clone-specific transmission to mosquitoes.
   Results. Seven of 12 persons that infected mosquitoes harbored mixed Pf/Pv infection. Among these 7 persons, all transmitted Pv with 2 transmitting both Pf and Pv, leading to Pf/Pv coinfection in 21% of infected mosquitoes. Up to 4 clones of each species were detected within persons. Shifts in clone frequency were detected during transmission. However, in general, all parasite clones in humans were transmitted to mosquitoes, with individual mosquitoes frequently carrying multiple transmitted clones.
   Conclusions. Malaria diversity in human hosts was maintained in the parasite populations recovered from mosquitoes fed on their blood. However, in persons with mixed Pf/Pv malaria, Pv appears to be transmitted more readily, in association with more prevalent patent gametocytemia.

TI An efficient and novel technology for the extraction of parasite genomic
   DNA from whole blood or culture
SO BIOTECHNIQUES
AB The aim of this study was to assess pathogen DNA extraction with a new spin column-based method (DNA-XT). DNA from either whole-blood samples spiked with Plasmodium falciparum or Leishmania donovani amastigote culture was extracted with DNA-XT and compared with that produced by a commercial extraction kit (DNeasy((R))). Eluates from large and small sample volumes were assessed by PCR and spectroscopy. Using a small volume (5 mu l) of blood, the DNA-XT and DNeasy methods produced eluates with similar DNA concentrations (0.63 vs 1.06 ng/mu l, respectively). The DNA-XT method produced DNA with lower PCR inhibition than DNeasy. The new technique was also twice as fast and required fewer plastics and manipulations but had reduced total recovered DNA compared with DNeasy.
   METHOD SUMMARY DNA-XT, which is designed for small sample volumes, uses a 5-min detergent and enzymatic lysis step to release DNA from cells. Contaminating proteins and lipids are then bound to a matrix within a spin column during a 1-min centrifugation step while DNA passes directly through.

TI Sexual forms obtained in a continuous in vitro cultured Colombian strain
   of Plasmodium falciparum (FCB2)
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The epidemiological control of malaria has been hampered by the appearance of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs and by the resistance of mosquito vectors to control measures. This has also been associated with weak transmission control, mostly due to poor control of asymptomatic patients associated with host-vector transmission. This highlights the importance of studying the parasite's sexual forms (gametocytes) which are involved in this phase of the parasite's life-cycle. Some African and Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum have been fully characterized regarding sexual forms' production; however, few Latin-American strains have been so characterized. This study was aimed at characterizing the Colombian FCB2 strain as a gametocyte producer able to infect mosquitoes. Methods Gametocyte production was induced in in vitro cultured P. falciparum FCB2 and 3D7 strains. Pfap2g and Pfs25 gene expression was detected in FCB2 strain gametocyte culture by RT-PCR. Comparative analysis of gametocytes obtained from both strains was made (counts and morphological changes). In vitro zygote formation from FCB2 gametocytes was induced by incubating a gametocyte culture sample at 27 degrees C for 20 min. A controlled Anopheles albimanus infection was made using an artificial feed system with cultured FCB2 gametocytes (14-15 days old). Mosquito midgut dissection was then carried out for analyzing oocysts. Results The FCB2 strain expressed Pfap2g, Pfs16, Pfg27/25 and Pfs25 sexual differentiation-related genes after in vitro sexual differentiation induction, producing gametocytes that conserved the expected morphological features. The amount of FCB2 gametocytes produced was similar to that from the 3D7 strain. FCB2 gametocytes were differentiated into zygotes and ookinetes after an in vitro low-temperature stimulus and infected An. albimanus mosquitoes, developing to oocyst stage. Conclusions Even with the history of long-term FCB2 strain in vitro culture maintenance, it has retained its sexual differentiation ability. The gametocytes produced here preserved these parasite forms' usual characteristics and An. albimanus infection capability, thus enabling its use as a tool for studying sexual form biology, An. albimanus infection comparative analysis and anti-malarial drug and vaccine development.

TI Molecular surveillance of Pfcrt and k13 propeller polymorphisms of
   imported Plasmodium falciparum cases to Zhejiang Province, China between
   2016 and 2018
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundResistance to anti-malarial drugs hinders malaria elimination. Monitoring the molecular markers of drug resistance helps improve malaria treatment policies. This study aimed to assess the distribution of molecular markers of imported Plasmodium falciparum infections.MethodsIn total, 485 P. falciparum cases imported from Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania into Zhejiang province, China, from 2016 to 2018 were investigated. Most were imported from Africa, and only a few cases originated in Asia and Oceania. Blood samples were collected from each patient. Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) at residues 72-76 and Kelch13-propeller (k13) were determined by nested PCR and DNA sequence.ResultsWild-type Pfcrt at residues 72-76 was predominant (72.61%), but mutant and mixed alleles were also detected, of which CVIET (22.72%) was the most common. Mutant Pfcrt haplotypes were more frequent in patients from West Africa (26.92%), North Africa (25%), and Central Africa (21.93%). The number of cases of P. falciparum infections was small in Southeast Asia and Oceania, and these cases involved Pfcrt mutant type. For the k13 propeller gene, 26 samples presented 19 different point mutations, including eight nonsynonymous mutations (P441S, D464E, K503E, R561H, A578S, R622I, V650F, N694K). In addition, R561H, one of the validated SNPs in k13, was detected in one patient from Myanmar and one patient from Rwanda. A578S, although common in Africa, was found in only one patient from Cameroon. R622I was detected in one sample from Mozambique and one sample from Somalia. The genetic diversity of k13 was low in most regions of Africa and purifying selection was suggested by Tajima's D test.ConclusionsThe frequency and spatial distributions of Pfcrt and k13 mutations associated with drug resistance were determined. Wild-type Pfcrt was dominant in Africa. Among k13 mutations correlated with delayed parasite clearance, only the R561H mutation was found in one case from Rwanda in Africa. Both Pfcrt and k13 mutations were detected in patients from Southeast Asia and Oceania. These findings provide insights into the molecular epidemiological profile of drug resistance markers in the study region.

TI Distribution of Anopheles mosquito species, their vectorial role and
   profiling of knock-down resistance mutations in Botswana
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Knowledge of vector species composition and monitoring their change over time is critical to evaluate malaria transmission and assess control interventions. This is especially important in countries such as Botswana, where malaria transmission is subjected to fluctuations due to climate variability. Another important aspect that impacts vector populations is the insecticide resistance. In order to assess species composition and the presence of mutations associated with insecticide resistance, Anopheles specimens from larval samplings and indoor pyrethrum spray sheet collections were analysed. A total of 349 Anopheles were screened by morphology and PCR as belonging to the An. gambiae complex and An. funestus group. Specimens were subsequently analysed for human blood meal and Plasmodium index. Finally, knock-down resistance polymorphisms were assessed. Anopheles arabiensis accounted for the majority of specimens collected through larval (96.7%) and pyrethrum spray sheet collection (87.4%) across all sampling sites, and this species was the only one found positive for human blood and for P. falciparum. Other Anopheles species were collected in small numbers by pyrethrum spray catches, namely An. quadriannulatus, An. longipalpis type C and An. parensis. The authors speculate on changing climate patterns and their possible impact on species composition. The kdr assay revealed that Anopheles mosquitoes were homozygous wild type for both L1014F (kdr-w) and L1014S (kdr-e) mutations. These results highlight the unique vectorial role of An. arabiensis in Botswana and indicated that even with prolonged use of pyrethroids and DDT, the mosquito population has not developed kdr mutations, despite some in vivo evidence of insecticide resistance.

TI Usefulness of day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentration as a predictor of
   malaria treatment outcome in under-fives children treated with
   artemether-lumefantrine in Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundDay 7 plasma lumefantrine concentration is suggested as a predictor for malaria treatment outcomes and a cut-off of >= 200 ng/ml is associated with day 28 cure rate in the general population. However, day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentration can be affected by age, the extent of fever, baseline parasitaemia, and bodyweight. Therefore, this study assessed the usefulness of day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentration as a predictor of malaria treatment outcome in under-fives children treated with generic or innovator drug-containing artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in Tanzania.MethodsThis study was nested in an equivalence prospective study that aimed at determining the effectiveness of a generic ALu (Artefan((R))) in comparison with the innovator's product (Coartem((R))). Children with uncomplicated malaria aged 6-59 months were recruited and randomized to receive either generic or innovator's product. Children were treated with ALu as per World Health Organization recommendations. The clinical and parasitological outcomes were assessed after 28 days of follow up. PCR was performed to distinguish recrudescence and re-infections among children with recurrent malaria. Analysis of day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentration was carried out using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection.ResultsThe PCR corrected cure rates were 98.7% for children treated with generic and 98.6% for those treated with the innovator product (p=1.00). The geometric mean (SD) of day 7 plasma lumefantrine concentration was 159.3 (+/- 2.4) ng/ml for the generic and 164 (+/- 2.5) ng/ml for the innovator groups, p=0.87. Geometric mean (+/- SD) day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentration between cured and recurrent malaria was not statistically different in both treatment arms [158.5 (+/- 2.4) vs 100.0 (+/- 1.5) ng/ml, (p=0.28) for generic arm and 158.5 (+/- 2.3) vs 251.2 (+/- 4.2) ng/ml, (p=0.24) for innovator arm]. Nutritional status was found to be a determinant of recurrent malaria (adjusted hazardous ratio (95% confidence interval)=3(1.1-8.2), p=0.029.Conclusion p id=Par Using the recommended cut-off point of >= 200 ng/ml, day 7 plasma lumefantrine concentration failed to predict malaria treatment outcome in children treated with ALu in Tanzania. Further studies are recommended to establish the day 7 plasma lumefantrine concentration cut-off point to predict malaria treatment outcome in children.

TI Malaria epidemiology in Kobeni department, southeastern Mauritania from
   2015 to 2017
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic in the southern sahelian zone of Mauritania where intense internal and trans-border human and livestock movement occurs. The risk of importation and spread of drug-resistant parasites need to be regularly assessed in this region. The objective of the study was to assess the recent malaria situation near the Mauritania-Mali border. Methods Between February 2015 and December 2017, patients with fever or history of fever during the previous 48 h, presenting at the health centre of Kobeni city, were screened for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopic examination of blood smears. The diagnosis was later confirmed by PCR. Cohen's kappa statistics was used to estimate the degree of agreement between diagnostic methods. Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. The odds ratio was calculated to measure the association between the use of bed nets and malaria infection. Results A total of 2326 febrile patients (mean age, 20.2 years) were screened for malaria. The presence of malaria parasites was detected by RDT and microscopy in 53.0% and 49.3% of febrile patients, respectively, and was confirmed by PCR in 59.7% (45 missing data). Of 1361 PCR-positive samples, 1205 (88.5%) were P. falciparum, 47 (3.5%) P. vivax, and 99 (7.3%) P. falciparum-P. vivax mixed infection. Malaria transmission occurred mostly during and shortly after the rainy season. The annual rainfall was relatively low in 2016 (267 mm) and 2017 (274 mm), compared to 2015 (448 mm), and coincided with a decline in malaria prevalence in 2016-2017. Although 71.8% of febrile patients reported to possess at least one bed net in the household in our questionnaire, its reported use was not protective against malaria infection (odds ratio: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.91-1.32). Conclusions Our study confirmed that P. falciparum is the dominant species in the sahelian zone and that malaria transmission is seasonal and associated with rainfall in this zone. The application of the current national policy based on rapid and reliable malaria diagnosis, case management with artemisinin-based combination therapy, intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women, distribution and use of long-lasting insecticide impregnated bed nets, and the planned introduction of seasonal malaria chemoprevention for all children under 6 years old is expected to sustainably reduce malaria transmission in this zone.

TI Electrochemical POC device for fast malaria quantitative diagnosis in
   whole blood by using magnetic beads, Poly-HRP and microfluidic paper
   electrodes
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Malaria, a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitos, is one of the main causes of mortality in many developing countries. Over 200 million new infections and nearly half a million deaths are reported each year, and more than three billion people are at risk of acquiring malaria worldwide. Nevertheless, most malaria cases could be cured if detected early. Malaria eradication is a top priority of the World Health Organisation. However, achieving this goal will require mass population screening and treatment, which will be hard to accomplish with current diagnostic tools.
   We report an electrochemical point-of-care device for the fast, simple and quantitative detection of Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) in whole blood samples. Sample analysis includes 5-min lysis to release intracellular parasites, and stirring for 5 more min with immuno-modified magnetic beads (MB) along with an immuno-modified signal amplifier. The rest of the magneto-immunoassay, including sample filtration, MB washing and electrochemical detection, is performed at a disposable paper electrode microfluidic device. The sensor provides PfLDH quantitation down to 2.47 ng mL(-1) in spiked samples and for 0.006-1.5% parasitemias in Plasmodium-infected cultured red blood cells, and discrimination between healthy individuals and malaria patients presenting parasitemias >0.3%. Quantitative malaria diagnosis is attained with little user intervention, which is not achieved by other diagnostic methods.

TI qRT-PCR versus IFA-based Quantification of Male and Female Gametocytes
   in Low-Density Plasmodium falciparum Infections and Their Relevance for
   Transmission
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Accurate quantification of female and male gametocytes and sex ratios in asymptomatic low-density malaria infections are important for assessing their transmission potential. Gametocytes often escape detection even by molecular methods, therefore ultralow gametocyte densities were quantified in large blood volumes.
   Methods. Female and male gametocytes were quantified in 161 PCR-positive Plasmodium falciparum infections from a cross-sectional survey in Papua New Guinea. Ten-fold concentrated RNA from 800 mu L blood was analyzed using female-specific pfs25 and male-specific pfmget or mssp qRT-PCR. Gametocyte sex ratios from qRT-PCR were compared with those from immunofluorescence assays (IFA).
   Results. Gametocytes were identified in 58% (93/161) P. falciparum-positive individuals. Mean gametocyte densities were frequently below 1 female and 1 male gametocyte/mu L by qRT-PCR. The mean proportion of males was 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.44) by pfs25/pfmget qRT-PCR; this correlated well with IFA results (Pearsons r(2) = 0.91; P < .001). A Poisson model fitted to our data predicted 16% P. falciparum-positive individuals that are likely to transmit, assuming at least 1 female and 1 male gametocyte per 2.5 mu L mosquito bloodmeal.
   Conclusions. Based on model estimates of female and male gametocytes per 2.5 mu L blood, P. falciparum-positive individuals detected exclusively by ultrasensitive diagnostics are negligible for human-to-mosquito transmission.

TI Plasma parasitemia as assessed by quantitative PCR in relation to
   clinical disease severity in African adults with falciparum malaria with
   and without HIV co-infection
SO INFECTION
AB Purpose When considering malaria disease severity, estimation of parasitemia in erythrocytes is important, but sometimes misleading, since the infected erythrocytes may be sequestered in peripheral capillaries. In African children and Asian adults with falciparum malaria, parasitemia as assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in plasma seems to be a valuable indicator of disease severity, but data on African adults as well as the impact of co-infection with HIV is lacking. Methods In 131 patients with falciparum malaria in a public tertiary teaching hospital in Mozambique, plasma malaria parasitemia as assessed by qPCR, compared to qualitative malaria PCR in blood cell fraction, was related to malaria disease severity and HIV co-infection. Results Of the 131 patients with falciparum malaria, based on positive qualitative PCR in the blood cell fraction, 93 patients (72%) had positive malaria qPCR in plasma. Patients with severe malaria as defined by the WHO criteria had higher malaria quantitative plasma parasitemia (median 143 genomes/mu L) compared to those with uncomplicated malaria (median 55 genomes/mu L, p = 0.037) in univariate analysis, but this difference was attenuated after adjusting for age, sex and HIV co-infection (p = 0.055). A quarter of the patients with severe malaria had negative qPCR in plasma. Conclusions This study of adult African in-patients with falciparum malaria with and without HIV co-infection, neither confirms nor rejects previous studies of malaria qPCR in plasma as an indicator of disease severity in patients with falciparum malaria. There is a need for further and larger studies to clarify if parasitemia as assessed malaria qPCR in plasma could be a surrogate marker of disease severity in falciparum malaria.

TI Interleukin-22 Polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum-Infected Malaria
   Patients
SO MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION
AB Background and Objectives. Malaria infection, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is the most lethal and frequently culminates in severe clinical complications. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) has been implicated in several diseases including malaria. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of IL-22 gene polymorphisms in P. falciparum infection. Material and Methods. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs976748, rs1179246, rs2046068, rs1182844, rs2227508, rs2227513, rs2227478, rs2227481, rs2227491, and rs2227483, of IL-22 gene were genotyped through PCR-based assays of 250 P. falciparum-infected patients and 200 healthy controls. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay was done to assess the role of the rs2227513 SNP in IL-22 gene promoter activity. Results. We found that the rs2227481 TT genotype (odds ratio 0.254, confidence interval = 0.097-0.663, P=0.002) and the T allele is associated with protection against P. falciparum malaria as well as the rs2227483 AT genotype (odds ratio 0.375, confidence interval = 0.187-0.754, P=0.004). The haplotype A-T-T of rs1179246, rs1182844, and rs976748 was statistically more frequent in the control group (frequency 41%, P=0.034) as well as the haplotype A-G of rs2046068 and rs2227491 (frequency 49.4%, P=0.041). The variant rs2227513 G allele had a statistically higher activity (P<0.0001) with the luciferase reporter assay. Conclusion. The study suggests that IL-22 polymorphisms in rs2227481 and rs2227483 could contribute to protection against P. falciparum malaria. Also, the G allele of rs2227513, located in the promoter region of IL-22 gene, could be essential for higher expression levels of IL-22 cytokine.

TI Use of real-time multiplex PCR, malaria rapid diagnostic test and
   microscopy to investigate the prevalence of Plasmodium species among
   febrile hospital patients in Sierra Leone
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria continues to affect over 200 million individuals every year, especially children in Africa. Rapid and sensitive detection and identification of Plasmodium parasites is crucial for treating patients and monitoring of control efforts. Compared to traditional diagnostic methods such as microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), DNA based methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offer significantly higher sensitivity, definitive discrimination of Plasmodium species, and detection of mixed infections. While PCR is not currently optimized for routine diagnostics, its role in epidemiological studies is increasing as the world moves closer toward regional and eventually global malaria elimination. This study demonstrates the field use of a novel, ambient temperature-stabilized, multiplexed PCR assay in a small hospital setting in Sierra Leone. Methods Blood samples from 534 febrile individuals reporting to a hospital in Bo, Sierra Leone, were tested using three methods: a commercial RDT, microscopy, and a Multiplex Malaria Sample Ready (MMSR) PCR designed to detect a universal malaria marker and species-specific markers for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A separate PCR assay was used to identify species of Plasmodium in samples in which MMSR detected malaria, but was unable to identify the species. Results MMSR detected the presence of any malaria marker in 50.2% of all tested samples with P. falciparum identified in 48.7% of the samples. Plasmodium vivax was not detected. Testing of MMSR P. falciparum-negative/universal malaria-positive specimens with a panel of species-specific PCRs revealed the presence of Plasmodium malariae (n = 2) and Plasmodium ovale (n = 2). The commercial RDT detected P. falciparum in 24.6% of all samples while microscopy was able to detect malaria in 12.8% of tested specimens. Conclusions Wider application of PCR for detection of malaria parasites may help to fill gaps existing as a result of use of microscopy and RDTs. Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, species coverage, room temperature stability and relative low complexity, the MMSR assay may be useful for detection of malaria and epidemiological studies especially in low-resource settings.

TI Improving Accuracy of Malaria Diagnosis in Underserved Rural and Remote
   Endemic Areas of Sub-Saharan Africa: A Call to Develop Multiplexing
   Rapid Diagnostic Tests
SO SCIENTIFICA
AB Clinical infection with malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, is considered a serious medical condition with the potential to become a life-threatening emergency. This is especially relevant to low-income countries in tropical and subtropical regions of the world where high rates of malaria-related morbidity and mortality are recorded. As a means to combat this major global public health threat, rapid and effective diagnosis remains the frontline action to initiate a timely and appropriate medical intervention. From all the approaches to parasite detection, rapid diagnostic tests, so-called RDTs, are the easiest to use and most cost-effective. However, some of the limitations inherent in this methodology could hinder effective patient treatment. A primary drawback is that the vast majority of commercially available RDTs detect only one of the five species of human malaria, P. falciparum. While this is the main cause of infection in many areas, it excludes the possibility of infection with another parasite (P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi) or of mixed infections containing different species. Hence, a diagnosis of non-P. falciparum malaria is missed. In turn, in resource-constrained settings where optimal microscopy is not available, a misdiagnosis of bacterial infection based on signs and symptoms alone often results in an inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. Here, we discuss how effective diagnosis of malaria and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in sub-Saharan Africa, a hot spot for P. falciparum transmission, may both be addressed by the development of innovative multiplexing RDTs that detect two or more species of Plasmodium.

TI Association of EPCR Polymorphism rs867186-GG With Severity of Human
   Malaria
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Background
   Cerebral malaria (CM) is characterized by the sequestration of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (pRBCs) to host brain microvasculature beds via P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Under normal conditions, activated protein C (APC) bound to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) has cytoprotective properties via the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1). During malaria infection, pRBCs transports PfEMP1 to the membranes to bind EPCR in the same region as APC. As a result, APC is less capable of inducing cytoprotective effects via PAR1. Two studies involving adult malaria patients revealed that EPCR rs867186-GG allele is associated with protection against severe malaria, while three other studies involving child malaria patients could not show association between EPCR rs867186-GG genotype and severe malaria or increased mortality among children with CM.
   Methods
   We examined the association between the EPCR rs867186-GG genotype and the protection against cerebral malaria. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 47 malaria patients and 34 healthy individuals from a study conducted from 2004 to 2007 at the NSCB Medical College Hospital in India. CM and malaria-associated complications were defined based on WHO criteria. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Primer sequences were designed to contain rs867186 of the PROCR gene (NM 006404) and were used to amplify a 660 bp product as described before. PCR products were purified, and DNA sequences were determined by Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz, NJ). Nonparametric tests were used to compare the groups. To analyze differences in allele frequencies, we used chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables if the expected values were less than 5. P-value Results
   Our results showed significantly higher rates of AG and GG genotypes in CM patients compared to mild malaria (P = 0.0034).
   Conclusion
   Our results indicate that rs867186-GG or rs867186-AG genotypes are not associated with protection against HCM.

TI The duration of chemoprophylaxis against malaria after treatment with
   artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine and the effects of
   pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T: a meta-analysis of individual patient data
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background The majority of Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in Africa are treated with the artemisinin combination therapies artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), with amodiaquine being also widely used as part of seasonal malaria chemoprevention programs combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. While artemisinin derivatives have a short half-life, lumefantrine and amodiaquine may give rise to differing durations of post-treatment prophylaxis, an important additional benefit to patients in higher transmission areas. Methods We analyzed individual patient data from 8 clinical trials of AL versus AS-AQ in 12 sites in Africa (n = 4214 individuals). The time to PCR-confirmed reinfection after treatment was used to estimate the duration of post-treatment protection, accounting for variation in transmission intensity between settings using hidden semi-Markov models. Accelerated failure-time models were used to identify potential effects of covariates on the time to reinfection. The estimated duration of chemoprophylaxis was then used in a mathematical model of malaria transmission to determine the potential public health impact of each drug when used for first-line treatment. Results We estimated a mean duration of post-treatment protection of 13.0 days (95% CI 10.7-15.7) for AL and 15.2 days (95% CI 12.8-18.4) for AS-AQ overall. However, the duration varied significantly between trial sites, from 8.7-18.6 days for AL and 10.2-18.7 days for AS-AQ. Significant predictors of time to reinfection in multivariable models were transmission intensity, age, drug, and parasite genotype. Where wild type pfmdr1 and pfcrt parasite genotypes predominated (<=20% 86Y and 76T mutants, respectively), AS-AQ provided similar to 2-fold longer protection than AL. Conversely, at a higher prevalence of 86Y and 76T mutant parasites (> 80%), AL provided up to 1.5-fold longer protection than AS-AQ. Our simulations found that these differences in the duration of protection could alter population-level clinical incidence of malaria by up to 14% in under-5-year-old children when the drugs were used as first-line treatments in areas with high, seasonal transmission. Conclusion Choosing a first-line treatment which provides optimal post-treatment prophylaxis given the local prevalence of resistance-associated markers could make a significant contribution to reducing malaria morbidity.

TI Activities of Endochin-Like Quinolones Against in vitro Cultured
   Besnoitia besnoiti Tachyzoites
SO FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB Endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) potently inhibit the proliferation of Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Neospora, and Babesia by targeting the cytochrome b Qo and Qi sites and interfering with oxidative phosphorylation and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The activities of 14 different ELQs were assessed against B. besnoiti tachyzoites grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) by quantitative real time PCR. The values for 50% proliferation inhibition (IC50) of five ELQs were determined in a 3-days growth assay after an initial screen of 12 ELQs at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mu M. The IC50s of ELQ-121, -136, and -316 were 0.49, 2.36, and 7.97 nM, respectively. The IC50s of ELQs tested against B. besnoiti were higher than IC50s previously observed for P. falciparum and T. gondii. However, the B. besnoiti cytochrome b sequence and the predicted Qo and Qi ELQ binding sites in the Toxoplasma, Neospora, and Besnoitia cytochrome b are virtually identical, suggesting that the differences in ELQ susceptibility are not due to variations in the substrate binding sites. TEM of ELQ-treated parasites primarily demonstrated alterations within the parasite mitochondrion, profound thickening of the nuclear membrane, as well as increased vacuolization within the tachyzoite cytoplasm. Long-term treatment assays of intracellular B. besnoiti with ELQs for up to 20 days followed by the release of drug pressure caused a substantial delay in parasite growth and proliferation while ELQs were present, but parasite proliferation resumed days after ELQs were removed. Interestingly, structural alterations persisted after ELQ removal and parasite proliferation was slowed. These findings provide a basis for further in vivo studies of ELQs as therapeutic options against B. besnoiti infection.

TI Relationship between placenta malaria and mother to child transmission
   of HIV infection in pregnant women in South East Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThis study determined the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among HIV positive women with placenta malaria and factors associated with placenta malaria.MethodsThis was a prospective observational study of booked HIV positive pregnant women in labour. A smear for malaria parasite was made from blood taken from the placental tissue post-delivery. The baby HIV testing was done with DNA polymerase chain reaction at 6 weeks postpartum. Data on age, parity, gestational age, religion, address, highest educational attainment and knowledge about malaria prevention in pregnancy was obtained with questionnaires and analysed using SPSS version 20. The P-value was set at 0.05 providing a confidence interval of 95%.ResultsA total of 174 booked HIV women participated in this study. The placental malaria parasitaemia prevalence was 44.8%. Overall rate of MTCT of HIV infection was 17.2%. Number of infants with HIV infection among women with maternal placental malarial parasitaemia was 30/78 (38.5%), while it was 0/96 (0%) for women without placenta malaria. There was significant relationship between placenta malaria density and infant HIV status (P-value=0.001). The relative risk for MTCT of HIV for women with placenta malaria Density >5000 was 25% with 95% confidence interval of 11.41-54.76%.ConclusionThe mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV was high among HIV positive women with placental malaria parasitaemia. There is the need to review the malarial treatment and prophylactic measures at least in this group of women and to establish the nature of relationship between placenta malaria and MTCT of HIV infection.

TI Epidemiology of malaria and chloroquine resistance in Mizoram,
   northeastern India, a malaria-endemic region bordering Myanmar
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMizoram, a northeastern state in India, shares international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh and is considered to be one of the key routes through which drug-resistant parasites of Southeast Asia enter mainland India. Despite its strategic location and importance, malaria epidemiology and molecular status of chloroquine resistance had not been well documented, and since chloroquine (CQ), as the first-line treatment in Plasmodium falciparum infection was discontinued since 2008, it was expected that CQ-sensitive haplotype would be more abundant.MethodsMalaria epidemiology data for the period 2010 to 2018 was collected from the office of State Vector Disease Control Programme. Plasmodium falciparum-positive blood samples were collected from government district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, sub-centres, and diagnostic centres from six malaria-prone districts. The samples were processed and analysed using genes-P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) via sequencing of PCR amplicon from 2015 to 2017.ResultsMalaria occurred throughout the year and P. falciparum accounted for>89% of total malaria cases. During 2010-2018, the highest number of malaria incidence was recorded in Lawngtlai (36% of total malaria cases; average API(2010-2018) of 34.8) while Champhai remained consistently low (0.4%; average API(2010-2018) of 0.04). Males of >= 15 years old contributed maximum (35.7%) among gender and age malarial distribution recorded during 2014-2018. Death due to malaria gradually decreased over the years. A higher abundance of mutated pfcrt (58.5% of the total sample analysed) and a lower prevalence of mutated pfmdr1 (48.7%) were observed. All mutations identified for pfcrt belong to the Southeast Asian CVIET haplotype. Only a single point mutation was observed at 86 (N -> Y) position in pfmdr1 (48.7%). The key N86Y mutation in pfmdr1 that had been shown to modulate CQR was found in 67.1% of the samples positive for the CVIET haplotype.ConclusionsThis is the first report that details malaria epidemiology and also the molecular status of CQ-resistance in P. falciparum population of the region. The efforts of the State Vector Borne Disease Control Programme have proved to be quite effective in controlling the malaria burden in the state. Despite the discontinuation of CQ for a decade, local P. falciparum is observed with decreased CQ-sensitive haplotype. It is believed that the present findings will form a basis for further studies on genetic diversity in P. falciparum, which could confer better understanding of the complexity of the disease in Southeast Asia.

TI Unraveling CAF-1 family in Plasmodium falciparum: comparative
   genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analysis among eukaryotes,
   expression profiling and protein-protein interaction studies
SO 3 BIOTECH
AB The present research reports a detailed in silico analysis of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) family in human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Our analysis revealed five chromatin assembly factor-1 genes in P. falciparum (PfCAF-1) and the PfCAF-1 family was divided into two classes where, Class A belongs to the CAF-1 complex and others are kept in Class B. For comparative studies, orthologs of PfCAF-1 family were identified across 53 eukaryotic species and evolutionary relationships were drawn for different CAF-1 subfamilies. The phylogenetic analysis revealed grouping of evolutionary-related species together, although, divergence was observed in branching pattern. A detailed analysis of domain composition highlighted species-specific features viz. species-specific KDDS repeats of 84 amino acids were identified in PfCAF-1A whereas, members of CAF-1C/RbAp48 and RbAp46 subfamily exhibited least variation in size and domain composition. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed upregulation of PfCAF-1 members in trophozoite or schizont stage. Furthermore, a comparative expression analysis of the available transcriptome and proteome data along with qRT-PCR analysis revealed mixed expression patterns (coordination as well as non-coordination between different studies). Protein-protein interaction network analyses of PfCAF-1 family were carried out highlighting important complexes based on interologs. The PfRbAp48 was found to be highly connected with a total of 108 PPIs followed by PfRbAp46. The results unravel insights into the PfCAF-1 family and identify unique features, thus opening new perspectives for further targeted developments to understand and combat malaria menace.

TI Prevalence of mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with
   resistance to different antimalarial drugs in Nyando, Kisumu County in
   Kenya
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Resistance to the mainstay antimalarial drugs is a major concern in the control of malaria. Delayed Plasmodium falciparum parasite clearance has been associated with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the kelch propeller region (K13). However, SNPs in the Pf-adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (Pfap2-mu), Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 are possible markers associated with multi-drug resistance. Here, we explored the prevalence of SNPs in the K13, Pfap2-mu, Pfcrt, and Pfmdr1 in 94 dried blood spot field isolates collected from children aged below 12 years infected with P. falciparum during a cross-sectional study. The samples were collected in 2015 during the peak malaria transmission season in the Nyando region of Western Kenya before treatment with Artemether-Lumefantrine, the first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in Kenya. However, 47 of the 94 samples had recurrent parasitemia and were interrogated for the presence of the SNPs in K13 and Pfap2-mu. We used PCR amplification and sequencing to evaluate specific regions of K13 (codons 432-702), Pfap2-mu (codons 1-350), Pfmdr1 (codons 86, 1034-1246), and Pfcrt (codons 72-76) gene(s). The majority of parasites harbored the wild type K13 sequence. However, we found a unique non-synonymous W611S change. In silico studies on the impact of the W611S predicted structural changes in the overall topology of the K13 protein. Of the 47 samples analyzed for SNPs in the Pfap2-mu gene, 14 (29%) had S160 N/T mutation. The CVIET haplotype associated with CQ resistance in the Pfcrt yielded a 7.44% (7/94), while CVMNK haplotype was at 92.56%. Mutations in the Pfmdr1 region were detected only in three samples (3/94; 3.19%) at codon D1246Y. Our data suggest that parasites in the western part of Kenya harbor the wildtype strains. However, the detection of the unique SNP in K13 and Pfap2-mu linked with ACT delayed parasite clearance may suggest slow filtering of ACT-resistant parasites.

TI Novel molecular diagnostic technique for detecting the different species
   of Plasmodium
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Background: Sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed for timely detection of malaria parasite and disease control. Molecular diagnostic techniques involving Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 18 s rRNA as a known diagnostic target with an overall sensitivity of 10 parasites per microliter is used as a gold standard. Till date, no attempt has been undertaken to develop a technique for the identification of four Plasmodium species in a single step PCR combined with restriction digestion with enzymes.
   Method: Plasmodium species-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays have been developed, based on RFLP of amplified PCR product of mitochondrial gene as a target. This approach identifies Plasmodium species in two steps involving amplification of mitochondrial (Mt) gene by PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzymes.
   Result: A total of 36 clinical samples were subjected to PCR-RFLP for the diagnosis and detection of malaria parasites targeting mitochondrial gene (Mt). The findings of the method were compared with gold standard methods (Microscopy, RDTs and Nested PCR) and was able to detect mixed infection with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.8% with respect to nested PCR. The results obtained by PCR-RFLP were validated with Sanger sequencing (n = 32) and were found to be consistent with the method.
   Conclusion: This method identifies and distinguishes four species of human malaria parasite namely P. falciparum (Pf), P. vivax (Pv), P. malariae (Pm) and P. ovale (Po) in approximately 4 h. To overcome and address PCR difficulties, continuous efforts are needed for the development of newer diagnostic techniques.

TI A Randomized Controlled Trial of Three- versus Five-Day
   Artemether-Lumefantrine Regimens for Treatment of Uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in Pregnancy in Africa
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Artemether-lumefantrine antimalarial efficacy in pregnancy could be compromised by reduced drug exposure. Population-based simulations suggested that therapeutic efficacy would be improved if the treatment duration was increased. We assessed the efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of an extended 5-day regimen of artemether-lumefantrine compared to the standard 3-day treatment in 48 pregnant women and 48 nonpregnant women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an open-label, randomized clinical trial. Babies were assessed at birth and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to characterize the plasma concentration-time profiles of artemether and lumefantrine and their metabolites. Both regimens were highly efficacious (100% PCR-corrected cure rates) and well tolerated. Babies followed up to 1 year had normal development. Parasite clearance half-lives were longer in pregnant women (median [range], 3.30 h [1.39 to 7.83 h]) than in nonpregnant women (2.43 h [1.05 to 6.00 h]) (P=0.005). Pregnant women had lower exposures to artemether and dihydroartemisinin than nonpregnant women, resulting in 1.2% decreased exposure for each additional week of gestational age. By term, these exposures were reduced by 48% compared to nonpregnant patients. The overall exposure to lumefantrine was improved with the extended regimen, with no significant differences in exposures to lumefantrine or desbutyl-lumefantrine between pregnant and nonpregnant women. The extended artemether-lumefantrine regimen was well tolerated and safe and increased the overall antimalarial drug exposure and so could be a promising treatment option in pregnancy in areas with lower rates of malaria transmission and/or emerging drug resistance.

TI Conventional and High-Sensitivity Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test
   Performance in 2 Transmission Settings: Haiti 2017
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Accurate malaria diagnosis is foundational for control and elimination, and Haiti relies on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) identifying Plasmodium falciparum in clinical and community settings. In 2017, 1 household and 2 easy-access group surveys tested all participants (N = 32 506) by conventional and high-sensitivity RDTs. A subset of blood samples (n = 1154) was laboratory tested for HRP2 by bead-based immunoassay and for P. falciparum 18S rDNA by photo-induced electron transfer polymerase chain reaction. Both RDT types detected low concentrations of HRP2 with sensitivity estimates between 2.6 ng/mL and 14.6 ng/mL. Compared to the predicate HRP2 laboratory assay, RDT sensitivity ranged from 86.3% to 96.0% between tests and settings, and specificity from 90.0% to 99.6%. In the household survey, the high-sensitivity RDT provided a significantly higher number of positive tests, but this represented a very small proportion (<0.2%) of all participants. These data show that a high-sensitivity RDT may have limited utility in a malaria elimination setting like Haiti.

TI Prevalence of plasmodium, leptospira and rickettsia species in Northern
   Tanzania: a community based survey
SO AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES
AB Background: The overlap of symptoms, geographic and seasonal co-occurrence of Plasmodium, Leptospira and Rickettsia infections makes malaria diagnosis difficult, increasing the chances of misdiagnosis. The paucity of data on the prevalence Plasmodium, Leptospira and Rickettsia infections contributes to an overly diagnosis of malaria. We aimed to determine the prevalence and distribution of Plasmodium, Leptospira and Rickettsia infections in northern Tanzania.
   Methods: A community based, cross sectional survey was conducted in two sites in Northern Tanzania. PCR was used to detect Plasmodium, Leptospira and Rickettsia infections.
   Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum and Leptospira spp were 31/128 (24.2%) and 3/128 (2.3%), respectively. No Rickettsia infection was detected in any of the two sites. Taking study sites separately, Plasmodium infection was detected in 31/63(49.2%) of participants in Bondo while Leptospira infection was detected in 3/65(4.6%) of participants in Magugu. Plasmodium was not detected in Magugu while no Leptospira infections were detected in Bondo. Fever was significantly associated with Plasmodium infection (chi 2= 12.44, p<0.001) and age (chi 2=17.44, p=0.000).
   Conclusion: Results from this study indicate Plasmodium infection as the main cause of fever in the studied sites. While Plasmodium and Leptospira contribute to fevers, Rickettsia infection is an insignificant cause of fever in Northern Tanzania.

TI Anopheles species composition and breeding habitat characterisation in
   Chiredzi District, Zimbabwe
SO AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY
AB Malaria is a public health concern in Zimbabwe and its transmission varies geographically and seasonally, corresponding with the country's rainfall pattern. Information on density and distribution of malaria vectors, species composition, breeding sites and quality assurance of the spray programme is limited for Chiredzi District. This study investigated mosquito species composition and distribution during winter, blood meal sources of adult collections, characteristics of aquatic larval habitats and quality of spraying as well as the insecticide residual activity on sprayed walls. Anopheline larvae were collected from breeding habitats that were subsequently characterised. Adult anophelines were sampled from both inside human dwellings and outdoors. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically and further processed to sibling species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where necessary. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite proteins and multiplex PCR was used to detect blood meal source. WHO cone bioassays were conducted to monitor spray quality and insecticide residual activity on spayed walls. A total of 21 aquatic habitats were identified from which anopheline larvae were sampled. Of these, 9 (42.9 %) were classified as permanent, 7 (33.3 %) as seasonal and 5 (23.8 %) as temporal. Anopheles mosquitoes from both adult and larval collections totalled to 153, with the former collection method accounting for 69.9%(107) and the latter for 31.1%(46). The collected mosquitoes were identified as An. quadriannulatus and An. funestus respectively. Out of the blood-fed An. funestus females, 70%(n = 10) had fed on human blood. None of the adult collected mosquitoes tested positive for P. falciparum circumsporozoite proteins. The aquatic habitats surveyed indicated that breeding sites were mainly man-made. Anopheles funestus was the only malaria vector recorded during this study. This species is a particularly efficient vector and its detection is a cause for concern. Furthermore, 70% of the adult-collected An. funestus female specimens had fed on humans confirming this species' strong tendency toward anthropophagy. A more comprehensive and year-round investigation is essential to gather appropriate and relevant entomological indices on malaria transmission in Chiredzi so as to enable effective vector control.

TI Development of DNA Aptamers Against Plasmodium falciparum Blood Stages
   Using Cell-Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB New biomarkers have to be developed in order to increase the performance of current antigen-based malaria rapid diagnosis. Antibody production often involves the use of laboratory animals and is time-consuming and costly, especially when the target is Plasmodium, whose variable antigen expression complicates the development of long-lived biomarkers. To circumvent these obstacles, we have applied the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment method to the rapid identification of DNA aptamers against Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (pRBCs). Five 70 b-long ssDNA sequences, and their shorter forms without the flanking PCR primer-binding regions, have been identified having a highly specific binding of pRBCs versus non-infected erythrocytes. Structural analysis revealed G-enriched sequences compatible with the formation of G-quadruplexes. The selected aptamers recognized intracellular epitopes with apparent K(d)s in the mu M range in both fixed and non-fixed saponin-permeabilized pRBCs, improving >30-fold the pRBC detection in comparison with aptamers raised against Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, the gold standard antigen for current malaria diagnostic tests. In thin blood smears of clinical samples the aptamers reported in this work specifically bound all P. falciparum stages versus non-infected erythrocytes, and also detected early and late stages of the human malaria parasites Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. The results are discussed in the context of their potential application in future malaria diagnostic devices.

TI First evidence of the deletion in the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in
   Plasmodium falciparum from Equatorial Guinea
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as a good alternative malaria-diagnosis method in remote parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of commercial RDTs currently available detect the Plasmodium falciparum protein histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2). There have also been recent reports of pfhrp2 gene deletions being found in parasites collected from several African countries. The WHO has concluded that lacking the pfhrp2 gene must be monitored in Africa. The purpose of the study was to analyse why the samples that were positive by PCR were negative by RDTs and, therefore, to determine whether there have been deletions in the pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes. Methods Malaria NM-PCR was carried out on all the samples collected in the field. A group of 128 samples was positive by PCR but negative by RDT; these samples were classified as RDT false-negatives. PCR was carried out for exon2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes to detect the presence or absence of these two genes. Frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for prevalence estimates. Associations were assessed by the Chi square test or Fisher ' s exact test. The level of significance was set at p <= 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the software package SPSSv.15.0. Results After PCR, 81 samples were identified (4.7%, 95% CI 3.8-5.8) which had deletion in both genes, pfhrp2 and pfhrp3. Overall, however, 11 samples (0.6%, 95% CI 0.36-1.14) had deletion only in pfhrp2 but not in pfhrp3, and 15 (0.9%, 95% CI 0.6-1.5) presented with deletion only in pfhrp3 but not in pfhrp2. Considering the pfhrp2 gene separately, within the total of 1724 samples, 92 (5.3%, 95% CI 4.37-6.5) had evidence of deletion. Conclusion The present study provides the first evidence of deletion in the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Equatorial Guinea. However, larger studies across different regions within the country and across different seasonal profiles are needed to determine the full extent of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion. It is strongly recommended to implement an active surveillance programme in order to detect any increases in pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion frequencies.

TI Plasmodium falciparum DDX55 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein and a 3 '-5 '
   direction-specific DNA helicase
SO PROTOPLASMA
AB Malaria is one of the major causes of mortality as well as morbidity in many tropical and subtropical countries around the world. Although artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are contributing to substantial decline in the worldwide malaria burden, it is becoming vulnerable by the emergence of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum leading to clinical failure of ACTs in Southeast Asia. Helicases play important role in nucleic acid metabolic processes and have been also identified as therapeutic drug target for different diseases. Previously, it has been reported that P. falciparum contains a group of DEAD-box family of helicases which are homologous to Has1 family of yeast. Here, we present the characterization of a member of Has1 family (PlasmoDB number PF3D7_1419100) named as PfDDX55. The biochemical characterization of PfDDX55C revealed that it contains both DNA- and RNA-dependent ATPase activity. PfDDX55C unwinds partially duplex DNA in 3 ' to 5 ' direction and utilizes mainly ATP or dATP for its activity. The immunofluorescence assay and q-RT PCR analysis show that PfDDX55 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein expressed in all the intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum 3D7 strain with maximum expression level in trophozoite stage. The LC-MS/MS experiment results and STRING analysis show that PfDDX55 interacts with AAA-ATPase which has been shown to be involved in ribosomal biogenesis.

TI Assessment of subpatent Plasmodium infection in northwestern Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundEthiopia has set a goal for malaria elimination by 2030. Low parasite density infections may go undetected by conventional diagnostic methods (microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests) and their contribution to malaria transmission varies by transmission settings. This study quantified the burden of subpatent infections from samples collected from three regions of northwest Ethiopia.MethodsSub-samples of dried blood spots from the Ethiopian Malaria Indicator Survey 2015 (EMIS-2015) were tested and compared using microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) to determine the prevalence of subpatent infection. Paired seroprevalence results previously reported along with gender, age, and elevation of residence were explored as risk factors for Plasmodium infection.ResultsOf the 2608 samples collected, the highest positive rate for Plasmodium infection was found with nPCR 3.3% (95% CI 2.7-4.1) compared with RDT 2.8% (95% CI 2.2-3.5) and microscopy 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.7). Of the nPCR positive cases, Plasmodium falciparum accounted for 3.1% (95% CI 2.5-3.8), Plasmodium vivax 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.7), mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.4), and mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium malariae 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.3). nPCR detected an additional 30 samples that had not been detected by conventional methods. The majority of the nPCR positive cases (61% (53/87)) were from the Benishangul-Gumuz Region. Malaria seropositivity had significant association with nPCR positivity [adjusted OR 10.0 (95% CI 3.2-29.4), P<0.001].ConclusionUsing nPCR the detection rate of malaria parasites increased by nearly threefold over rates based on microscopy in samples collected during a national cross-sectional survey in 2015 in Ethiopia. Such subpatent infections might contribute to malaria transmission. In addition to strengthening routine surveillance systems, malaria programmes may need to consider low-density, subpatent infections in order to accelerate malaria elimination efforts.

TI Molecular characterization of Plasmodium falciparum antifolate
   resistance markers in Thailand between 2008 and 2016
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundResistance to anti-malarials is a major threat to the control and elimination of malaria. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) anti-malarial treatment was used as a national policy for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand from 1973 to 1990. In order to determine whether withdrawal of this antifolate drug has led to restoration of SP sensitivity, the prevalence of genetic markers of SP resistance was assessed in historical Thai samples.MethodsPlasmodium falciparum DNA was collected from the Thailand-Myanmar, Thailand-Malaysia and Thailand-Cambodia borders during 2008-2016 (N=233). Semi-nested PCR and nucleotide sequencing were used to assess mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr), P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps). Gene amplification of Plasmodium falcipaurm GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (pfgch1) was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The association between pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations and pfgch1 copy numbers were evaluated.ResultsMutations in pfdhfr/pfdhsp and pfgch1 copy number fluctuated overtime through the study period. Altogether, 14 unique pfdhfr-pdfhps haplotypes collectively containing quadruple to octuple mutations were identified. High variation in pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotypes and a high proportion of pfgch1 multiple copy number (51% (73/146)) were observed on the Thailand-Myanmar border compared to other parts of Thailand. Overall, the prevalence of septuple mutations was observed for pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotypes. In particular, the prevalence of pfdhfr-pfdhps, septuple mutation was observed in the Thailand-Myanmar (50%, 73/146) and Thailand-Cambodia (65%, 26/40) border. In Thailand-Malaysia border, majority of the pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotypes transaction from quadruple (90%, 9/10) to quintuple (65%, 24/37) during 2008-2016. Within the pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotypes, during 2008-2013 the pfdhps A/S436F mutation was observed only in Thailand-Myanmar border (9%, 10/107), while it was not identified later. In general, significant correlation was observed between the prevalence of pfdhfr I164L (= 0.213, p-value=0.001) or pfdhps K540E/N (phi = 0.399, p-value <= 0.001) mutations and pfgch1 gene amplification.Conclusions p id=PaR Despite withdrawal of SP as anti-malarial treatment for 17 years, the border regions of Thailand continue to display high prevalence of antifolate and anti-sulfonamide resistance markers in falciparum malaria. Significant association between pfgch1 amplification and pfdhfr (I164L) or pfdhps (K540E) resistance markers were observed, suggesting a compensatory mutation.

TI The Delay in the Licensing of Protozoal Vaccines: A Comparative History
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Although viruses and bacteria have been known as agents of diseases since 1546, 250 years went by until the first vaccines against these pathogens were developed (1796 and 1800s). In contrast, Malaria, which is a protozoan-neglected disease, has been known since the 5th century BCE and, despite 2,500 years having passed since then, no human vaccine has yet been licensed for Malaria. Additionally, no modern human vaccine is currently licensed against Visceral or Cutaneous leishmaniasis. Vaccination against Malaria evolved from the inoculation of irradiated sporozoites through the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes in 1930's, which failed to give protection, to the use of controlled human Malaria infection (CHMI) provoked by live sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum and curtailed with specific chemotherapy since 1940's. Although the use of CHMI for vaccination was relatively efficacious, it has some ethical limitations and was substituted by the use of injected recombinant vaccines expressing the main antigens of the parasite cycle, starting in 1980. Pre-erythrocytic (PEV), Blood stage (BSV), transmission-blocking (TBV), antitoxic (AT), and pregnancy-associated Malaria vaccines are under development. Currently, the RTS,S-PEV vaccine, based on the circumsporozoite protein, is the only one that has arrived at the Phase III trial stage. The "R" stands for the central repeat region of Plasmodium (P.) falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP); the "T" for the T-cell epitopes of the CSP; and the "S" for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In Africa, this latter vaccine achieved only 36.7% vaccine efficacy (VE) in 5-7 years old children and was associated with an increase in clinical cases in one assay. Therefore, in spite of 35 years of research, there is no currently licensed vaccine against Malaria. In contrast, more progress has been achieved regarding prevention of leishmaniasis by vaccine, which also started with the use of live vaccines. For ethical reasons, these were substituted by second-generation subunit or recombinant DNA and protein vaccines. Currently, there is one live vaccine for humans licensed in Uzbekistan, and four licensed veterinary vaccines against visceral leishmaniasis: Leishmune (R) (76-80% VE) and CaniLeish (R) (68.4% VE), which give protection against strong endpoints (severe disease and deaths under natural conditions), and, under less severe endpoints (parasitologically and PCR-positive cases), Leishtec (R) developed 71.4% VE in a low infective pressure area but only 35.7% VE and transient protection in a high infective pressure area, while Letifend (R) promoted 72% VE. A human recombinant vaccine based on the Nucleoside hydrolase NH36 of Leishmania (L.) donovani, the main antigen of the Leishmune (R) vaccine, and the sterol 24-c-methyltransferase (SMT) from L. (L.) infantum has reached the Phase I clinical trial phase but has not yet been licensed against the disease. This review describes the history of vaccine development and is focused on licensed formulations that have been used in preventive medicine. Special attention has been given to the delay in the development and licensing of human vaccines against Protozoan infections, which show high incidence worldwide and still remain severe threats to Public Health.

TI Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine as first
   line therapy of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso, 11 years after
   policy change
SO PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Introduction: artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) are the first line therapy of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso. We assessed the treatment efficacy, tolerability of these drugs 11 years following its adoption as first line treatment. Methods: in this opened randomized controlled trial carried out in 2016, participants with age over 6 months who consented to participate were randomly assigned treatment with artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine and followed up for 28 days. Primary endpoint was the treatment efficacy over 28 days of follow up unadjusted by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: two hundred and eighty-one (281) participants were enrolled and the completion rate was 92.9%. No early treatment failure was found. Adequate clinical and parasitological responses were significantly higher in artesunate-amodiaquine group (97% versus 85.2%, p = 0.0008). On day 28, the risk of failure was 4 times higher in AL group 20.14%, 95% CI (13-30.47) against 5.16%, 95% CI (1.91-13.54) in ASAQ group. All treatments had a similar and good tolerability profile. Conclusion: eleven years following artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine adoption as first line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso, artemether-lumefantrine retained fairly good efficacy even though its efficacy fell below WHO threshold of 90% considering uncorrected outcome.

TI A seven-year surveillance of epidemiology of malaria reveals travel and
   gender are the key drivers of dispersion of drug resistant genotypes in
   Kenya
SO PEERJ
AB Malaria drug resistance is a global public health concern. Though parasite mutations have been associated with resistance, other factors could influence the resistance. A robust surveillance system is required to monitor and help contain the resistance. This study established the role of travel and gender in dispersion of chloroquine resistant genotypes in malaria epidemic zones in Kenya. A total of 1,776 individuals presenting with uncomplicated malaria at hospitals selected from four malaria transmission zones in Kenya between 2008 and 2014 were enrolled in a prospective surveillance study assessing the epidemiology of malaria drug resistance patterns. Demographic and clinical information per individual was obtained using a structured questionnaire. Further, 2 mL of blood was collected for malaria diagnosis, parasitemia quantification and molecular analysis. DNA extracted from dried blood spots collected from each of the individuals was genotyped for polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine transporter gene (Pfcrt 76), Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistant gene 1 (Pfmdrl 86 and Pfmdrl 184) regions that are putative drug resistance genes using both conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. The molecular and demographic data was analyzed using Stata version 13 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) while mapping of cases at the selected geographic zones was done in QGIS version 2.18. Chloroquine resistant (CQR) genotypes across gender revealed an association with chloroquine resistance by both univariate model (p = 0.027) and by multivariate model (p = 0.025), female as reference group in both models. Prior treatment with antimalarial drugs within the last 6 weeks before enrollment was associated with carriage of CQR genotype by multivariate model (p = 0.034). Further, a significant relationship was observed between travel and CQR carriage both by univariate model (p = 0.001) and multivariate model (p = 0.002). These findings suggest that gender and travel are significantly associated with chloroquine resistance. From a gender perspective, males are more likely to harbor resistant strains than females hence involved in strain dispersion. On the other hand, travel underscores the role of transport network in introducing spread of resistant genotypes, bringing in to focus the need to monitor gene flow and establish strategies to minimize the introduction of resistance strains by controlling malaria among frequent transporters.

TI Sequence Analysis of the K13-Propeller Gene in Artemisinin Challenging
   Plasmodium falciparum Isolates from Malaria Endemic Areas of Odisha,
   India: A Molecular Surveillance Study
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Estimation of the spread and advancement of Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin-resistant parasites can be done by probing polymorphisms in the kelch (Pfk13) domain (a validated molecular marker). This study aimed to provide baseline information for future artemisinin surveillance by analyzing the k13-propeller domain in P. falciparum field isolates collected from 24 study areas in 14 malaria hot spots of Odisha (previously Orissa) during July 2018-January 2019. A total of 178 P. falciparum mono infections were assessed. An 849-base pair fragment encoding the Pfk13 propeller was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in both directions (PCR). After DNA alignment with the 3D7 reference sequence, all samples were found to be wild type. It can be anticipated that malaria public health is not under direct threat in Odisha relating to ART resistance.

TI Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum and genetic profile in
   children affected by uncomplicated malaria in Cameroon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria is a major public health problem in Cameroon. The study of the genetic diversity within parasite population is essential for understanding the mechanism underlying malaria pathology and to determine parasite clones profile in an infection, for proper malaria control strategies. The objective of this study was to perform a molecular characterization of highly polymorphic genetic markers of Plasmodium falciparum, and to determine allelic distribution with their influencing factors valuable to investigate malaria transmission dynamics in Cameroon. Methods A total of 350 P. falciparum clinical isolates were characterized by genotyping block 2 of msp-1, block 3 of msp-2, and region II of glurp gene using nested PCR and DNA sequencing between 2012 and 2013. Results A total of 5 different genotypes with fragment sizes ranging from 597 to 817 bp were recorded for GLURP. Overall, 16 MSP-1 genotypes, including K1, MAD20 and RO33 were identified, ranging from 153 to 335 bp. A peculiarity about this study is the RO33 monomorphic pattern revealed among the Pfmsp-1 allelic type. Again, this study identified 27 different Pfmsp-2 genotypes, ranging from 140 to 568 bp in size, including 15 belonging to the 3D7-type and 12 to the FC27 allelic families. The analysis of the MSP-1 and MSP-2 peptides indicates that the region of the alignment corresponding K1 polymorphism had the highest similarity in the MSP1and MSP2 clade followed by MAD20 with 93% to 100% homology. Therefore, population structure of P. falciparum isolates is identical to that of other areas in Africa, suggesting that vaccine developed with K1 and MAD20 of Pfmsp1 allelic variant could be protective for Africa children but these findings requires further genetic and immunological investigations. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for Pfmsp-2 loci (3.82), as compare with Pfmsp-1 (2.51) and heterozygotes ranged from 0.55 for Pfmsp-1 to 0.96 for Pfmsp-2. Conclusion High genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in P. falciparum isolates indicate a persisting high level of transmission. This study advocate for an intensification of the malaria control strategies in Cameroon. Trial registration This study was approved by Cameroon National Ethics Committee. It is a randomized controlled trial retrospectively registered in NIH U.S. National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov on the 28/11/2016 at with the registration number NCT02974348

TI Impact of an Irrigation Dam on the Transmission and Diversity of
   Plasmodium falciparum in a Seasonal Malaria Transmission Area of
   Northern Ghana
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Water bodies such as dams are known to alter the local transmission patterns of a number of infectious diseases, especially those transmitted by insects and other arthropod vectors. The impact of an irrigation dam on submicroscopic asexual parasite carriage in individuals living in a seasonal malaria transmission area of northern Ghana was investigated. A total of 288 archived DNA samples from two cross-sectional surveys in two communities in the Bongo District of Northern Ghana were analysed. Parasite density was determined by light microscopy and PCR, and parasite diversity was assessed by genotyping of the polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum msp2 block-3 region. Submicroscopic parasitaemia was estimated as the proportional difference between positive samples identified by PCR and microscopy. Dry season submicroscopic parasite prevalence was significantly higher (71.0%, p=0.013) at the dam site compared with the nondam site (49.2%). Similarly, wet season submicroscopic parasite prevalence was significantly higher at the dam site (54.5%, p=0.008) compared with the nondam site (33.0%). There was no difference in parasite density between sites in the dry season (p=0.90) and in the wet season (p=0.85). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) based on PCR data was significantly higher at the dam site compared with the nondam site during the dry season (p<0.0001) but similar between sites during the wet season. MOI at the nondam site was significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season (2.49, 1.26, p<0.0001) but similar between seasons at the dam site. Multivariate analysis showed higher odds of carrying submicroscopic parasites at the dam site in both dry season (OR = 7.46, 95% CI = 3.07-18.15) and in wet season (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.04-2.86). The study findings suggest that large water bodies impact year-round carriage of submicroscopic parasites and sustain Plasmodium transmission.

TI Prospective assessment of malaria infection in a semi-isolated Amazonian
   indigenous Yanomami community: Transmission heterogeneity and
   predominance of submicroscopic infection
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the Amazon basin, indigenous forest-dwelling communities typically suffer from a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria. Difficulties in accessing these isolated ethnic groups, such as the semi-nomadic Yanomami, make official malaria data largely underestimated. In the current study, we longitudinally surveyed microscopic and submicroscopic malaria infection in four Yanomami villages of the Marari community in the northern-most region of the Brazilian Amazon. Malaria parasite species-specific PCR-based detection of ribosomal and non-ribosomal targets showed that approximately 75% to 80% of all malaria infections were submicroscopic, with the ratio of submicroscopic to microscopic infection remaining stable over the 4-month follow-up period. Although the prevalence of malaria infection fluctuated over time, microscopically-detectable parasitemia was only found in children and adolescents, presumably reflecting their higher susceptibility to malaria infection. As well as temporal variation, the prevalence of malaria infection differed significantly between villages (from 1% to 19%), demonstrating a marked heterogeneity at micro-scales. Over the study period, Plasmodium vivax was the most commonly detected malaria parasite species, followed by P. malariae, and much less frequently P. falciparum. Consecutive blood samples from 859 out of the 981 studied Yanomami showed that malaria parasites were detected in only 8% of the previously malaria-positive individuals, with most of them young children (median age 3 yrs). Overall, our results show that molecular tools are more sensitive for the identification of malaria infection among the Yanomami, which is characterized by heterogeneous transmission, a predominance of low-density infections, circulation of multiple malaria parasite species, and a higher susceptibility in young children. Our findings are important for the design and implementation of the new strategic interventions that will be required for the elimination of malaria from isolated indigenous populations in Latin America.

TI Molecular surveillance of anti-malarial drug resistance in Democratic
   Republic of Congo: high variability of chloroquinoresistance and lack of
   amodiaquinoresistance
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe loss of chloroquine (CQ) effectiveness has led to its withdrawal from national policies as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in several endemic countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The K76T mutation on the pfcrt gene has been identified as a marker of CQ resistance and the SVMNT haplotype in codons 72-76 on the same gene has been associated with resistance to amodiaquine (AQ). In the DRC, the prevalence of K76T has decreased from 100% in 2000 to 63.9% in 2014. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of K76T mutations in circulating strains of Plasmodium falciparum, 16 years after CQ withdrawal in the DRC and to investigate the presence of the SVMNT haplotype.MethodsIn 2017, ten geographical sites across the DRC were selected. Dried blood samples were collected from patients attending health centres. Malaria was first detected by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) available on site (SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf or CareStart Malaria Pf) or thick blood smear and then confirmed by a P. falciparum species-specific real-time PCR assay. A pfcrt gene segment containing a fragment that encodes amino acids at positions 72-76 was amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing.ResultsA total of 1070 patients were enrolled. Of the 806 PCR-confirmed P. falciparum positive samples, 764 were successfully sequenced. The K76T mutation was detected in 218 samples (28.5%; 95% CI 25.4%-31.9%), mainly (96%) with the CVIET haplotype. Prevalence of CQ resistance marker was unequally distributed across the country, ranging from 1.5% in Fungurume to 89.5% in Katana. The SVMNT haplotype, related to AQ resistance, was not detected.ConclusionOverall, the frequency of the P. falciparum CQ resistance marker has decreased significantly and no resistance marker to AQ was detected in the DRC in 2017. However, the between regions variability of CQ resistance remains high in the country. Further studies are needed for continuous monitoring of the CQ resistance level for its prospective re-use in malaria management. The absence of the AQ resistance marker is in line with the use of this drug in the current DRC malaria treatment policy.

TI WHO malaria nucleic acid amplification test external quality assessment
   scheme: results of distribution programmes one to three
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends parasite-based diagnosis of malaria. In recent years, there has been surge in the use of various kinds of nucleic-acid amplification based tests (NAATs) for detection and identification of Plasmodium spp. to support clinical care in high-resource settings and clinical and epidemiological research worldwide. However, these tests are not without challenges, including lack (or limited use) of standards and lack of reproducibility, due in part to variation in protocols amongst laboratories. Therefore, there is a need for rigorous quality control, including a robust external quality assessment (EQA) scheme targeted towards malaria NAATs. To this effect, the WHO Global Malaria Programme worked with the UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UK NEQAS) Parasitology and with technical experts to launch a global NAAT EQA scheme in January 2017. Methods Panels of NAAT EQA specimens containing five major species of human-infecting Plasmodium at various parasite concentrations and negative samples were created in lyophilized blood (LB) and dried blood spot (DBS) formats. Two distributions per year were sent, containing five LB and five DBS specimens. Samples were tested and validated by six expert referee laboratories prior to distribution. Between 37 and 45 laboratories participated in each distribution and submitted results using the online submission portal of UK NEQAS. Participants were scored based on their laboratory's stated capacity to identify Plasmodium species, and individual laboratory reports were sent which included performance comparison with anonymized peers. Results Analysis of the first three distributions revealed that the factors that most significantly affected performance were sample format (DBS vs LB), species and parasite density, while laboratory location and the reported methodology used (type of nucleic acid extraction, amplification, or DNA vs RNA target) did not significantly affect performance. Referee laboratories performed better than non-referee laboratories. Conclusions Globally, malaria NAAT assays now inform a range of clinical, epidemiological and research investigations. EQA schemes offer a way for laboratories to assess and improve their performance, which is critical to safeguarding the reliability of data and diagnoses especially in situations where various NAAT methodologies and protocols are in use.

TI Molecular detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum
   gametocytes carriage in used RDTs in malaria elimination settings in
   northern Senegal
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria surveillance requires powerful tools and strategies to achieve malaria elimination. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (RDTs) are easily deployed on a large scale and are helpful sources of parasite DNA. The application of sensitive molecular techniques to these RDTs is a modern tool for improving malaria case detection and drug resistance surveillance. Several studies have made it possible to extract the DNA of Plasmodium falciparum from RDTs. The knowledge of gametocyte carriage in the population is important to better assess the level of parasite transmission in elimination settings. The aim of this study was to detect P. falciparum gametocytes from used RDTs by quantitative PCR for molecular monitoring of malaria transmission. Methods DNA was extracted from 303 RDT devices (SD Bioline Malaria Pf) using the Chelex-100 protocol. qPCR was performed in a 20 mu L reaction to detect and quantify transcripts of the pfs25 gene. The cycle threshold (Ct) was determined by the emission fluorescence corresponding to the initial amount of amplified DNA. Results The study found an overall prevalence of 53.47% with an average Ct of 32.12 +/- 4.28 cycles. In 2018, the prevalence of gametocytes was higher in the Ranerou district (76.24%) than in the Saint-Louis district (67.33%) where an increase in the number of gametocyte carriers in 2018 was noted, in comparison with 2017. Conclusions RDTs are a good source of DNA for molecular monitoring of gametocyte carriage. This method is a simple and effective tool to better understand the level of malaria transmission with a view to elimination.

TI Immunogenicity analysis of conserved fragments in Plasmodium ovale
   species merozoite surface protein 4
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background There is an urgent need for an effective vaccine to control and eradicate malaria, one of the most serious global infectious diseases. Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4. Methods The msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays. Results Full peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as similar to 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.

TI Classification of induced malaria case in an elimination setting:
   investigation of transfusion-transmitted malaria cases
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Since the National Malaria Elimination Action Plan was launched in China in 2010, local malaria transmission has decreased rapidly. Zero indigenous cases were reported since 2017. However, after 2010, the proportion of imported cases in China increased from 45.7% in 2010 to 99.9% in 2016, and almost all provinces of China have reported imported cases in recent years. Prevention of the reintroduction of malaria into China is crucial for the maintenance of its malaria-free status. Hence, it is of utmost importance to correctly identify the source of malaria infections within the country. Case introduction and response In 2016 and 2017, three laboratory-confirmed cases of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum were identified in patients with no previous travel history to endemic areas were reported in Jiangsu Province, China, where malaria due to P. falciparum was eliminated about 30 years ago. These were diagnosed after 41, 31 and 39 days of seeking treatment, respectively, and all of them had received blood transfusions. Further investigations indicated that two of the cases had received blood from foreign students (from Indonesia and Ghana), and the other had received blood from an individual who had worked in Equatorial Guinea. All three blood donors were traced, and found to be carrying asymptomatic P. falciparum infections by microscopic examination and PCR. Furthermore, five polymorphic microsatellite markers (C1M4, C4M62, C13M13, C14M17, and C13M63) were typed and used to link parasites from the donors with those of the transfusion-receiving patients. Conclusions Three transfusion-transmitted malaria cases were identified in China, all of which were due to the transfusion of blood donated by individuals who had contracted malaria outside the country. These cases can provide a reference for those faced with similar challenges in malaria case identification and classification in other regions. In addition, a stricter screening policy including the use of appropriate detection methods for malaria parasites should be developed and adopted for blood donation in regions undergoing malaria elimination.

AB This case control study was aimed to determine the role of rs8177400 polymorphism in TIR-domain-containing-adaptor-protein gene in malaria susceptibility and clinical outcomes upon P. falciparum and P. vivax exposure. Blood samples of 228 malaria patients and 226 healthy controls were selected from the local population. Malarial samples were divided in to complicated malaria (N=89) and mild malaria (N=139) groups according to WHO criteria. Malarial groups were further divided into P. vivax and P. falciparum groups based on the Plasmodium species responsible for the infection. Allele specific PCR was employed for the amplification of rs8177400 polymorphism. Results of genotyping were confirmed via PCR-RFLP strategy. Presence of GG genotype decreases the susceptibility of malaria (OR: 0.544, CI: 0.331 to 0.894, p=0.053), mild malaria (OR: 0.472, CI: 0.274 to 0.815, p=0.024) and P. vivax infection (OR: 0.362, CI: 0.211 to 0.622, p=0.000). AG heterozygosity increased the susceptibility of malaria (OR: 1.835, CI: 1.117 to 3.013, p=0.053), mild malaria (OR: 2.115, CI: 1.226 to 3.649, p=0.024) and P. vivax infection (OR: 2.758, CI: 1.607 to 4.732, p=0.000). GG genotype decreased the risk of mild malaria due to P. vivax infection (OR: 0.312, 95% CI: 0.170 to 0.572, p=0.000). AG genotype increased the chances of mild malaria due to P. vivax infection (OR: 3.205, 95% CI: 1.747 to 5.878, p=0.000). P. vivax infection may develop mild malaria symptoms in AG carriers of rs8177400 polymorphism in the Pakistani population.

TI A Computer Modelling Approach To Evaluate the Accuracy of Microsatellite
   Markers for Classification of Recurrent Infections during Routine
   Monitoring of Antimalarial Drug Efficacy
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Antimalarial drugs have long half-lives, so clinical trials to monitor their efficacy require long periods of follow-up to capture drug failure that may become patent only weeks after treatment. Reinfections often occur during follow-up, so robust methods of distinguishing drug failures (recrudescence) from emerging new infections are needed to produce accurate failure rate estimates. Molecular correction aims to achieve this by comparing the genotype of a patient's pretreatment (initial) blood sample with that of any infection that occurs during follow-up, with matching genotypes indicating drug failure. We use an in silico approach to show that the widely used match-counting method of molecular correction with microsatellite markers is likely to be highly unreliable and may lead to gross under- or overestimates of the true failure rates, depending on the choice of matching criterion. A Bayesian algorithm for molecular correction was previously developed and utilized for analysis of in vivo efficacy trials. We validated this algorithm using in silk degrees data and showed it had high specificity and generated accurate failure rate estimates. This conclusion was robust for multiple drugs, different levels of drug failure rates, different levels of transmission intensity in the study sites, and microsatellite genetic diversity. The Bayesian algorithm was inherently unable to accurately identify low-density recrudescence that occurred in a small number of patients, but this did not appear to compromise its utility as a highly effective molecular correction method for analyzing microsatellite genotypes. Strong consideration should be given to using Bayesian methodology to obtain accurate failure rate estimates during routine monitoring trials of antimalarial efficacy that use microsatellite markers.

TI Widespread resistance mutations to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in malaria
   parasites imported to China from Central and Western Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB Background: Imported cases of infectious disease provide invaluable information about epidemiological conditions abroad, and should guide treatment decisions at home and abroad. Here, we examined cases of malaria imported from Africa to China for mutations eroding the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), sometimes used as an intermittent preventive treatment during for pregnant women and infants.
   Methods: A total of 208 blood samples were collected from P. falciparum-infected workers who had returned from Western and Central Africa to Guangxi Province Frequency distribution. Samples were analyzed for the mutations in dhfr and dhps genes by PCR -sequencing. The prevalence of dhfr and dhps polymorphisms was analyzed. Among the isolates, polymorphisms were detected in mutants N51I, C59R, S108N and I164L of Pfdhfr and I431V, 5436 A/F, A437G, K540 E/N, A581G and A613T of pfdhps.
   Results: Mutations promoting drug resistance were widespread in this cohort. For pfdhfr and pfdhps, wild types were equally rare among patients returned from Western Africa and Central Africa. A triple-mutant dhfr haplotype was most prevalent (> 70%). We report for the first time mutation I164L-dhfr and I431V-dhps in Ghana, and for the first time we found A581G to exceed a clinically-relevant threshold that may counter-indicate current clinical practices. For Pfdhps, the double-mutant IAGKAA was high prevalent haplotype in Ghana, Western Africa. The single-mutant ISGKAA was a majority haplotype in Cameroon. Alarmingly, a "super resistance" quintuple mutant was detected, for the first time, in parasites of West African origin (defined by IAGKAA/IRNI in combination with pfdhps 581G and dhfr I164L). This may limit the efficacy of this drug combination for even intermittent clinical applications.
   Conclusions: These data are cause for great concern and call for continued surveillance of the efficacy of SP in source and recipient populations, and should be considered when developing treatment policy for imported malaria cases in China and elsewhere.

TI Diagnostic Performance of Three Rapid Diagnostic Test Kits for Malaria
   Parasite Plasmodium falciparum
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Malaria is a potent burden on public healthcare worldwide due to requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. Nowadays, prompt diagnosis with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has been widely accepted as an effective diagnostic technique in malaria-endemic countries, primarily due to their easy operation, fast output, and straightforward interpretation. The global availability and use of RDTs have gradually grown over recent decades as field-applicable diagnostic tests for the reliable confirmation of malaria infection and proper case management. This study was conducted to evaluate diagnostic performance of 3 commercially available malaria RDT kits : BIOCREDIT (TM) Malaria Ag Pf(pLDH), Malaria Ag Pf(pLDH/pHRPII), and Malaria Ag Pf/Pv(pLDH/pLDH) (where pLDH and pHRPII stand for plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase and histidine-rich protein 2, respectively) for the specific detection of Plasmodium falciparum. A total of 1,129 blood samples including 95 blood samples, confirmed as vivax malaria infection by microscopic examinations and a nested-PCR method, were tested for falciparum malaria infection. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Malaria Ag Pf(pLDH/pHRPII), Malaria Ag Pf/Pv(pLDH/pLDH), and Pf(pLDH) for P. falciparum were 99.0% and 100%, 95.8% and 100%, and 100% and 100%, respectively. It is proposed that the 3 RDT kits perform reliable level of diagnostic accuracy of detection for P. falciparum parasites.

TI Evaluation of Asymptomatic Malaria Status in Eastern of Afghanistan
   Using High Resolution Melting Analysis
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: Malaria is threatening more than half of Afghanistan population. Asymptomatic malaria is notable problem against malaria controlling strategies. In this study we evaluated the asymptomatic malaria status in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan in 2017.
   Methods: Overall, 296 finger blood samples were taken on DNA Banking Cards and microscopic slides from asymptomatic individuals in Jalalabad city. We used a novel post real time PCR high resolution melting analysis beside microscopy and semi-nested multiplex PCR to evaluate status of asymptomatic malaria in this city.
   Results: The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in Jalalabad city was determined 1.7% (5/296), 7.43% (22/296) and 7.78% (26/296) by microscopy, Seminested multiplex PCR and qRT-PCR-HRM, respectively. Out of 26 positive cases were detected by qRT-PCR-HRM, 21, 1 and 4 cases were detected P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our data indicating on existence of significant number of asymptomatic reservoirs that assists in prolonged endemicity of the disease. On the other hand, the molecular methods are better alternatives for microscopy especially for monitoring of asymptomatic cases of malaria.

TI Detection of Amino Acid Mutations in Dihydrofolate Reductase & Dihydro
   Pteroate Synthase Gene in Plasmodium Vivax Isolates
SO JOURNAL OF THE LIAQUAT UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES
AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and patterns of mutations and distribution of alleles in Plasmodium. Vivax Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) & Dihydro Pteroate Synthase (DHPS) genes in Karachi.
   METHODOLOGY: The descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the Department of Biotechnology, University of Karachi from June 2014 to February 2016. The sampling technique used was Non-probability convenient sampling method.
   A total of n=200 malaria cases irrespective of age and gender from Jinnah Medical College Hospital Korangi Karachi were selected. Around 200 mu L of blood was collected in micro centrifuge tubes. Among them, 36 cases of P. vivax were detected by microscopy. DNA was extracted from these 36 samples followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of amplified genes of Plasmodium vivax Dihydrofolate reductase (PVDHFR) & Plasmodium vivax Dihydro pteroate synthase (PVDHP).
   RESULTS: The analysis of 36 amplified P. vivax isolates revealed presence of various alleles of pvdhfr and pvdhps genes producing both wild type (W) and mutant amino acids having single, double & multiple mutations at multiple positions. In pvdhfr gene, common mutations were observed in 'S' amino acids at codons 58 &117 and 'D' at codons 105 &157. Regarding pvdhps gene, common mutations were observed in 'V' amino acids at codon 398 and 'K' at codon 590.
   CONCLUSION: The frequency and variety of mutations we detected in pvdhfr and pvdhps genes signify the drug resistance in plasmodium vivax so there is need of some measures to control drug resistance by better formulation using combination of drugs.

TI Performance evaluation of a prototype rapid diagnostic test for combined
   detection of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis and malaria
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   Malaria is endemic in all regions where gambiense or rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is reported, and both diseases have similarities in their symptomatology. A combined test could be useful for both diseases and would facilitate integration of the screening for gambiense HAT (gHAT) and malaria diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate a combined prototype rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for gHAT and malaria.
   Methods
   Blood samples were collected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda to evaluate the performance of a prototype HAT/Malaria Combined RDT in comparison to an individual malaria RDT based on Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.) Histidine Rich Protein II (HRP-II or HRP2) antigen (SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f. RDT) for malaria detection and an individual gHAT RDT based on recombinant antigens, the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 RDT for HAT screening. Due to the current low prevalence of gHAT in endemic regions, the set of blood samples that were collected was used to evaluate the specificity of the RDTs for gHAT, and additional archived plasma samples were used to complete the evaluation of the HAT/Malaria Combined RDT in comparison to the HAT 2.0 RDT.
   Results
   Frozen whole blood samples from a total of 486 malaria cases and 239 non-malaria controls, as well as archived plasma samples from 246 gHAT positive and 246 gHAT negative individuals were tested. For malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the malaria band in the HAT/Malaria Combined RDT were 96.9% (95% CI: 95.0-98.3) and 97.1% (95% CI: 94.1-98.8) respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the SD BIOLINE malaria Ag P.f. RDT were 97.3% (95% CI: 95.5-98.6) and 97.1% (95% CI: 94.1-98.8) respectively. For gHAT, using archived plasma samples, the sensitivity and specificity were respectively 89% (95% CI: 84.4-92.6) and 93.5% (95% CI: 89.7-96.2) with the HAT/Malaria Combined RDT, and 88.2% (95% CI: 83.5-92) and 94.7% (95% CI: 91.1-97.2) with the HAT 2.0 RDT. Using the whole blood samples that were collected during the study, the specificity of the HAT/Malaria Combined RDT for gHAT was 95.8% (95% CI: 94.3-97.0).
   Conclusion
   The HAT/Malaria Combined prototype RDT was as accurate as the individual malaria or gHAT RDTs. The HAT/Malaria Combined prototype RDT is therefore suitable for both malaria diagnosis and gHAT screening. However, there is a need to assess its accuracy using fresh samples in prospective clinical trials.
   Author summary
   The annual number of reported cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness (SS), is currently below 1,000 cases worldwide. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the most affected country, and Uganda, which shares a border with DRC, are both endemic for gambiense HAT (gHAT). The main strategy to control gHAT is screening of at-risk individuals, followed by diagnosis and treatment of confirmed cases. However, this strategy and even the passive screening as currently implemented become less efficient with declining incidence, justifying innovative strategies to efficiently detect the remaining cases. All areas where gHAT occurs are also endemic for malaria, presenting an opportunity to integrate gHAT screening activities within malaria control activities. This integration is warranted by the fact that in early disease stage, gHAT patients present with signs and symptoms strikingly similar to those of malaria. In order to use malaria diagnosis as an entry point to screen for gHAT, Standard Diagnostics (SD), Republic of Korea (now Abbott Diagnostics, Korea Inc-ADK) made a Combined prototype RDT for both malaria and gHAT, expected to be as accurate as the individual gHAT and malaria RDTs. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the Combined prototype RDT using whole blood samples collected in Uganda and DRC, and archived plasma samples collected in DRC, Angola and Central African Republic. We found that the Combined prototype performs just as well as individual RDTs.

TI Malaria parasitemia among blood donors in Uganda
SO TRANSFUSION
AB BACKGROUND Malaria remains a leading transfusion associated infectious risk in endemic areas. However, the prevalence of malaria parasitemia has not been well characterized in blood donor populations. This study sought to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium in red blood cell (RBC) and whole blood (WB) units after the rainy season in Uganda.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS Between May and July 2018, blood was collected from the sample diversion pouch of 1000 WB donors in Kampala and Jinja, Uganda. The RBC pellet from ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated blood was stored at -80 degrees C until testing. DNA was extracted and nested PCR was used to screen samples at the genus level for Plasmodium, with positive samples further tested for species identification.
   RESULTS Malaria parasitemia among asymptomatic, eligible blood donors in two regions of Uganda was 15.4%; 87.7% (135/154) of infections were with P. falciparum, while P. malariae and P. ovale were also detected. There were 4.3% of blood donors who had mixed infection with multiple species. Older donors (>30 years vs. 17-19 years; aPR = 0.31 [95% CI = 0.17-0.58]), females (aPR = 0.60 [95% CI = 0.42-0.87]), repeat donors (aPR = 0.44 [95% CI = 0.27-0.72]) and those donating near the capital city of Kampala versus rural Jinja region (aPR = 0.49 [95% CI = 0.34-0.69]) had a lower prevalence of malaria parasitemia.
   CONCLUSIONS A high proportion of asymptomatic blood donors residing in a malaria endemic region demonstrate evidence of parasitemia at time of donation. Further research is needed to quantify the risk and associated burden of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) in order to inform strategies to prevent TTM.

TI Effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine doses for prevention of malaria
   during pregnancy in hypoendemic area in Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria in pregnancy increases the risk of deleterious maternal and birth outcomes. The use of >= 3 doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (IPTp-SP) is recommended for preventing the consequences of malaria during pregnancy. This study assessed the effect of IPTp-SP for prevention of malaria during pregnancy in low transmission settings. Methods A cross-sectional study that involved consecutively selected 1161 pregnant women was conducted at Mwananyamala regional referral hospital in Dar es Salaam. Assessment of the uptake of IPTp-SP was done by extracting information from antenatal clinic cards. Maternal venous blood, cord blood, placental blood and placental biopsy were collected for assessment of anaemia and malaria. High performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was used to detect and quantify sulfadoxine (SDX). Dried blood spots (DBS) of placental blood were collected for determination of sub-microscopic malaria using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results In total, 397 (34.2%) pregnant women reported to have used sub-optimal doses (<= 2) while 764 (65.8%) used optimal doses (>= 3) of IPTp-SP at the time of delivery. The prevalence of placental malaria as determined by histology was 3.6%. Submicroscopic placental malaria was detected in 1.4% of the study participants. Women with peripheral malaria had six times risk of maternal anaemia than those who were malaria negative (aOR, 5.83; 95% CI 1.10-30.92; p = 0.04). The geometric mean plasma SDX concentration was 10.76 +/- 2.51 mu g/mL. Sub-optimal IPTp-SP dose was not associated with placental malaria, premature delivery and fetal anaemia. The use of <= 2 doses of IPTp-SP increased the risk of maternal anaemia by 1.36-fold compared to >= 3 doses (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI 1.04-1.79; p = 0.02). Conclusion The use of < 2 doses of IPTp-SP increased the risk of maternal anaemia. However, sub-optimal doses (<= 2 doses) were not associated with increased the risk of malaria parasitaemia, fetal anaemia and preterm delivery among pregnant women in low malaria transmission setting. The use of optimal doses (>= 3 doses) of IPTp-SP and complementary interventions should continue even in areas with low malaria transmission.

TI Development of a quantitative, portable, and automated fluorescent
   blue-ray device-based malaria diagnostic equipment with an on-disc SiO2
   nanofiber filter
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB There is an urgent need to develop an automated malaria diagnostic system that can easily and rapidly detect malaria parasites and determine the proportion of malaria-infected erythrocytes in the clinical blood samples. In this study, we developed a quantitative, mobile, and fully automated malaria diagnostic system equipped with an on-disc SiO2 nanofiber filter and blue-ray devices. The filter removes the leukocytes and platelets from the blood samples, which interfere with the accurate detection of malaria by the blue-ray devices. We confirmed that the filter, which can be operated automatically by centrifugal force due to the rotation of the disc, achieved a high removal rate of leukocytes (99.7%) and platelets (90.2%) in just 30s. The automated system exhibited a higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (92.8%) for detecting Plasmodium falciparum from the blood of 274 asymptomatic individuals in Kenya when compared to the common rapid diagnosis test (sensitivity=98.1% and specificity = 54.8%). This indicated that this system can be a potential alternative to conventional methods used at local health facilities, which lack basic infrastructure.

TI Evaluation of residual submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum parasites 3
   days after initiation of treatment with artemisinin-based combination
   therapy
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Plasmodium falciparum resistance against artemisinin has not emerged in Africa; however, there are reports of the presence of polymerase chain reaction-determined residual submicroscopic parasitaemia detected on day 3 after artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). These residual submicroscopic parasites are thought to represent tolerant/resistant parasites against artemisinin, the fast-acting component of the combination. This review focused on residual submicroscopic parasitaemia, what it represents, and its significance on the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in Africa. Presence of residual submicroscopic parasitemia on day 3 after treatment initiation leaves question on whether successful treatment is attained with ACT. Thus there is a need to determine the potential public health implication of the PCR-determined residual submicroscopic parasitaemia observed on day 3 after ACT. Robust techniques, such as in vitro cultivation, should be used to evaluate if the residual submicroscopic parasites detected on day 3 after ACT are viable asexual parasites, or gametocytes, or the DNA of the dead parasites waiting to be cleared from the circulation. Such techniques would also evaluate the transmissibility of these residual parasites.

TI Annotation and characterization of Babesia gibsoni apicoplast genome
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB BackgroundBabesia gibsoni is an apicomplexan parasite transmitted by ticks, which can infect canine species and cause babesiosis. The apicoplast is an organelle associated with isoprenoids metabolism, is widely present in apicomplexan parasites, except for Cryptosporidium. Available data indicate that the apicoplast is essential for the survival of apicomplexan parasites.MethodsHere, the apicoplast genome of B. gibsoni was investigated by high-throughput genome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and conventional PCR.ResultsThe apicoplast genome of B. gibsoni-Wuhan strain (B. gibsoni-WH) consists of a 28.4 kb circular molecule, with A+T content of 86.33%, similar to that of B. microti. Specifically, this genome encodes genes involved in maintenance of the apicoplast DNA, transcription, translation and maturation of organellar proteins, which contains 2 subunits of ribosomal RNAs, 17 ribosomal proteins, 1 EF-Tu elongation factor (tufA), 5 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta subunits, 2 Clp protease chaperones, 23 tRNA genes and 5 unknown open reading frames (hypothetical proteins). Phylogenetic analysis revealed high similarity of B. gibsoni apicoplast genome to that of B. orientalis and B. bovis.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first report of annotation and characterization of B. gibsoni-WH apicoplast genome. The results will facilitate the development of new anti-Babesia drug targets.

TI Prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection and associated
   factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Fendeka town
   health facilities, Jawi District, North west Ethiopia: A cross-sectional
   study
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Malaria in pregnancy remains a major public health problem especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In malaria endemic areas, majority of pregnant women may remain asymptomatic but still associated with complications on the mother and her foetus. They also serve as reservoirs and act as transmitters of infection. Despite these effects, the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care has not been yet studied at the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Fendeka town health facilities.

   Health facility based cross -sectional study was conducted from February to March 2019. A total of 331 participants were enrolled by using convenient sampling technique. Sociodemographic and associated factors were collected by a face to face interview. All the 331 samples were tested using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy. However, only 83 dried blood spot (DBS) samples out of 331 participants, were collected by using systematic random sampling technique for molecular analysis. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections. Univariate logistic regression was employed to assess factors associated with asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection. Variables with P-value < 0.25 in the univariate logistic regression were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis model. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and P- values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
   Results
   Overall, 37 (11.2%) asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections were detected using: RDTs, microscopy and real-time PCR altogether. The asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection prevalence was 17 (5.1%), 30 (9.1%) and 15(18.1%) using RDTs, microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections were more likely to occur in primigravida (AOR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.27-16.03), secundigravida (AOR: 3.87, 95% CI: 1.16-12.93), rural inhabitants (AOR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.72-11.84) and in participants who did not use indoor residual spray (IRS) for the last one year (AOR: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.47-6.66).
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection was 11.2%. Pregnant women who reside in the rural area, primigravidae, secugravidae and those who did not utilize indoor residual spray for the last one year were at high risk of infection. Therefore, routine laboratory diagnosis of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection among pregnant women should be adopted as a part of the antenatal care.

CA Tracking Resistance Artemisinin
TI Triple artemisinin-based combination therapies versus artemisinin-based
   combination therapies for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: a
   multicentre, open-label, randomised clinical trial
SO LANCET
AB Background Artemisinin and partner-drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum are major threats to malaria control and elimination. Triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs), which combine existing co-formulated ACTs with a second partner drug that is slowly eliminated, might provide effective treatment and delay emergence of antimalarial drug resistance.
   Methods In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, we recruited patients with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria at 18 hospitals and health clinics in eight countries. Eligible patients were aged 2-65 years, with acute, uncomplicated P falciparum malaria alone or mixed with non-falciparum species, and a temperature of 37.5 degrees C or higher, or a history of fever in the past 24 h. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two treatments using block randomisation, depending on their location: in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar patients were assigned to either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; at three sites in Cambodia they were assigned to either artesunate-mefloquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; and in Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo they were assigned to either artemether-lumefantrine or artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine. All drugs were administered orally and doses varied by drug combination and site. Patients were followed-up weekly for 42 days. The primary endpoint was efficacy, defined by 42-day PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. A detailed assessment of safety and tolerability of the study drugs was done in all patients randomly assigned to treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02453308, and is complete.
   Findings Between Aug 7, 2015, and Feb 8, 2018, 1100 patients were given either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (183 [17%]), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (269 [24%]), artesunate-mefloquine (73 [7%]), artemether-lumefantrine (289 [26%]), or artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine (286 [26%]). The median age was 23 years (IQR 13 to 34) and 854 (78%) of 1100 patients were male. In Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam the 42-day PCR-corrected efficacy after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine was 98% (149 of 152; 95% CI 94 to 100) and after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was 48% (67 of 141; 95% CI 39 to 56; risk difference 51%, 95% CI 42 to 59; p<0.0001). Efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine in the three sites in Myanmar was 91% (42 of 46; 95% CI 79 to 98) versus 100% (42 of 42; 95% CI 92 to 100) after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (risk difference 9%, 95% CI 1 to 17; p=0.12). The 42-day PCR corrected efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (96% [68 of 71; 95% CI 88 to 99]) was non-inferior to that of artesunate-mefloquine (95% [69 of 73; 95% CI 87 to 99]) in three sites in Cambodia (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -6 to 8; p=1.00). The overall 42-day PCR-corrected efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine (98% [281 of 286; 95% CI 97 to 99]) was similar to that of artemether-lumefantrine (97% [279 of 289; 95% CI 94 to 98]; risk difference 2%, 95% CI -1 to 4; p=0.30). Both TACTs were well tolerated, although early vomiting (within 1 h) was more frequent after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (30 [3.8%] of 794) than after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (eight [1.5%] of 543; p=0.012). Vomiting after artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine (22 [1.3%] of 1703) and artemetherlumefantrine (11 [0.6%] of 1721) was infrequent. Adding amodiaquine to artemether-lumefantrine extended the electrocardiogram corrected QT interval (mean increase at 52 h compared with baseline of 8.8 ms [SD 18.6] vs 0.9 ms [16.1]; p<0.01) but adding mefloquine to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine did not (mean increase of 22.1 ms [SD 19.2] for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine vs 20.8 ms [SD 17.8] for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; p=0.50).
   Interpretation Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine TACTs are efficacious, well tolerated, and safe treatments of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, including in areas with artemisinin and ACT partner-drug resistance.

TI Lactate dehydrogenase: An important molecule involved in acetamizuril
   action against Eimeria tenella
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a vital enzyme in anaerobic glycolysis, is closely associated with the survival of parasites. Previous studies of some parasites have shown that LDH exhibits unique physicochemical properties and molecular structures and may be an ideal potential target for diagnosis and drug screening. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of acetamizuril, a novel anticoccidial compound, on LDH in the second-generation merozoites of Eimeria tenella (mz-LDH). Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and enzyme activity assays were each applied to detect the changes of mz-LDH. Our results indicated that the mRNA and protein levels of mz-LDH were reduced upon acetamizuril treatment. Immunolocalization of mz-LDH demonstrated that considerable amount of mz-LDH was distributed around or in the nuclei of second-generation merozoites within the untreated group; in contrast, the acetamizuril-treated group had very low level of mz-LDH. Meanwhile, LDH enzyme activity assay suggested that a decreased LDH enzyme activity in both cytoplasm and nucleus of merozoites in the acetamizuril-treated group. Moreover, the induced apoptosis in second-generation merozoites by the acetamizuril was evaluated by detecting caspase 3 activity, and acetamizuril was found to significantly increase caspase 3 activity. The above findings show that LDH may play an important role in the mediating the activity of acetamizuril against coccidiosis, and further investigation into this aspect might contribute to new light on the pathogenesis of E. tenella during its interaction with acetamizuril.

TI Artemether-Lumefantrine Efficacy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated
   Plasmodium falciparum Malaria in Choco, Colombia after 8 Years as
   First-Line Treatment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in Colombia. To assess AL efficacy for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Quibdo, Choco, Colombia, we conducted a 28-day therapeutic efficacy study (TES) following the WHO guidelines. From July 2018 to February 2019, febrile patients aged 5-65 years with microscopy-confirmed P. falciparum mono-infection and asexual parasite density of 250-100,000 parasites/mu L were enrolled and treated with a supervised 3-day course of AL. The primary endpoint was adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28. We attempted to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping to differentiate reinfection and recrudescence, and conducted genetic testing for antimalarial resistance-associated genes. Eighty-eight patients consented and were enrolled; four were lost to follow-up or missed treatment doses. Therefore, 84 (95.5%) participants reached a valid endpoint: treatment failure or ACPR. No patient remained microscopy positive for malaria on day 3, evidence of delayed parasite clearance and artemisinin resistance. One patient had recurrent infection (12 parasites/mu L) on day 28. Uncorrected ACPR rate was 98.8% (83/84) (95% CI: 93.5-100%). The recurrent infection sample did not amplify during molecular testing, giving a PCR-corrected ACPR of 100% (83/83) (95% CI: 95.7-100%). No P. falciparum kelch 13 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance were identified. Our results support high AL efficacy for falciparum malaria in Choco. Because of the time required to conduct TESs in low-endemic settings, it is important to consider complementary alternatives to monitor antimalarial efficacy and resistance.

TI Capture and Detection of Plasmodium vivax Lactate Dehydrogenase in a
   Bead-Based Multiplex Immunoassay
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Laboratory detection of malaria antigens has proved valuable for research and epidemiological purposes. We recently developed a bead-based multiplex antigen assay for pan-Plasmodium and Plasmodium falciparum targets. Here, we report integration of a Plasmodium vivax-specific target to this multiplex panel: P. vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH). Within the multiplex panel, assay signal for purified PvLDH antigen titrated into the single-digit picogram range. Against a panel of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed samples from acute P. vivax infections (n = 36), sensitivity was 91.7% in using PvLDH detection for identifying the presence of parasites. Specificity against a panel of persons with no Plasmodium infection (n = 44) was 100%, and specificity against a panel of PCR-confirmed P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, or Plasmodium ovale infections (n = 164) was 90.2%. Addition of this PvLDH capture and detection system into the multiplex antigen panel will now allow for sensitive screening for species identification of both P. falciparum and P. vivax in the laboratory.

TI Loop-Primer Endonuclease Cleavage-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification
   Technology for Multiplex Pathogen Detection and Single-Nucleotide
   Polymorphism Identification
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides effective diagnostic technology for infectious disease pathogen identification and is compatible with inexpensive instrumentation for use in disease-prevalent developing regions. However, simultaneous multiple-target detection and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification, essential properties of nucleic acid diagnostics, are difficult to achieve using LAMP. This study introduces loop-primer endonuclease cleavage (LEC)-LAMP, a singleplex or multiplex LAMP technology with single-base specificity for variable SNP identification. We developed a singleplex LEC-LAMP Neisseria meningitidis assay that demonstrated complete analytical specificity and a limit of detection of 3.1 genome copies per reaction. Small-scale clinical testing of this assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and sensitivity when assessed with anonymized DNA extracts from confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis infection. The single-base specificity of this assay indicated effective SNP identification properties when challenged with DNA templates containing SNPs located within a specific six-base region. This assay was modified to generate an allele-specific LEC-LAMP N. meningitidis assay that successfully demonstrated single-tube differentiation of wildtype and mutant allele templates. The singleplex assay was further modified to generate a multiplex LEC-LAMP assay that successfully demonstrated simultaneous multiple-target detection of three bacterial targets, N. meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Hemophilus influenzae. LEC-LAMP is the first report of single-tube, real-time, singleplex or multiplex LAMP technology with single-base specificity for variable SNP identification.

TI Recombinase Polymerase Amplification and Lateral Flow Assay for
   Ultrasensitive Detection of Low-Density Plasmodium falciparum Infection
   from Controlled Human Malaria Infection Studies and Naturally Acquired
   Infections
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs) are the main diagnostic tools for malaria but fail to detect low-density parasitemias that are important for maintaining malaria transmission. To complement existing diagnostic methods, an isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification and lateral flow assay (RT-RPA) was developed. We compared the performance with that of ultrasensitive reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (uRT-qPCR) using nucleic acid extracts from blood samples (n = 114) obtained after standardized controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. As a preliminary investigation, we also sampled asymptomatic individuals (n = 28) in an area of malaria endemicity (Lambarene, Gabon) to validate RT-RPA and assess its performance with unprocessed blood samples (dbRT-RPA). In 114 samples analyzed from CHMI trials, the positive percent agreement to uRT-qPCR was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 96). The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 92 to 100). The lower limit of detection was 64 parasites/ml. In Gabon, RT-RPA was 100% accurate with asymptomatic volunteers (n = 28), while simplified dbRT-RPA showed 89% accuracy. In a subgroup analysis, RT-RPA detected 9/10 RT-qPCR-positive samples, while loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detected 2/10. RT-RPA is a reliable diagnostic test for asymptomatic low-density infections. It is particularly useful in settings where uRT-qPCR is difficult to implement.

TI A novel multiplex qPCR assay for detection of Plasmodium falciparum with
   histidine-rich protein 2 and 3 (pfhrp2 and pfhrp3) deletions in
   polyclonal infections
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Many health facilities in malaria endemic countries are dependent on Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosis and some National Health Service (NHS) hospitals without expert microscopists rely on them for diagnosis out of hours. The emergence of P. falciparum lacking the gene encoding histidine-rich protein 2 and 3 (HRP2 and HRP3) and escaping RDT detection threatens progress in malaria control and elimination. Currently, confirmation of RDT negative due to the deletion of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3, which encodes a cross-reactive protein isoform, requires a series of PCR assays. These tests have different limits of detection and many laboratories have reported difficulty in confirming the absence of the deletions with certainty.
   Methods: We developed and validated a novel and rapid multiplex real time quantitative (qPCR) assay to detect pfhrp2, pfhrp3, confirmatory parasite and human reference genes simultaneously. We also applied the assay to detect pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion in 462 field samples from different endemic countries and UK travellers.
   Results: The qPCR assay demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (n = 19, 95% CI = (82.3%; 100%)) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (n = 31; 95% CI = (88.8%; 100%)) in detecting pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. In addition, the assay estimates P. falciparum parasite density and accurately detects pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions masked in polyclonal infections. We report pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in parasite isolates from Kenya, Tanzania and in UK travellers.
   Interpretation: The new qPCR is easily scalable to routine surveillance studies in countries where P. falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 are a threat to malaria control. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Selection and exploitation of prevalent, tandemly repeated genomic
   targets for improved real-time PCR-based detection of Wuchereria
   bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum in mosquitoes
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Optimization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics requires the careful selection of molecular targets that are both highly repetitive and pathogen-specific. Advances in both next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and bioinformaticsbased analysis tools are facilitating this selection process, informing target choices and reducing labor. Once developed, such assays provide disease control and elimination programs with an additional set of tools capable of evaluating and monitoring intervention successes. The importance of such tools is heightened as intervention efforts approach their endpoints, as accurate and complete information is an essential component of the informed decision-making process. As global efforts for the control and elimination of both lymphatic filariasis and malaria continue to make significant gains, the benefits of diagnostics with improved analytical and clinical/field-based sensitivities and specificities will become increasingly apparent.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Coupling Illumina-based NGS with informatics approaches, we have successfully identified the tandemly repeated elements in both the Wuchereria bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum genomes of putatively greatest copy number. Utilizing these sequences as quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-based targets, we have developed assays capable of exploiting the most abundant tandem repeats for both organisms. For the detection of P. falciparum, analysis and development resulted in an assay with improved analytical and field-based sensitivity vs. an established ribosomal sequence-targeting assay. Surprisingly, analysis of the W. bancrofti genome predicted a ribosomal sequence to be the genome's most abundant tandem repeat. While resulting cycle quantification values comparing a qPCR assay targeting this ribosomal sequence and a commonly targeted repetitive DNA sequence from the literature supported our finding that this ribosomal sequence was the most prevalent tandemly repeated target in the W. bancrofti genome, the resulting assay did not significantly improve detection sensitivity in conjunction with field sample testing.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Examination of pathogen genomes facilitates the development of PCR-based diagnostics targeting the most abundant and specific genomic elements. While in some instances currently available tools may deliver equal or superior performance, systematic analysis of potential targets provides confidence that the selected assays represent the most advantageous options available and that informed assay selection is occurring in the context of a particular study's objectives.

TI Recurrence of Plasmodium malariae and P. falciparum Following Treatment
   of Uncomplicated Malaria in North Sumatera With
   Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine or Artemether-Lumefantrine
SO OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. We assessed the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, with or without co-infecting Plasmodium spp., in Sumatera, Indonesia.
   Methods. Febrile patients aged >6 months with uncomplicated P. falciparum were randomized to receive dihydroartemisininpiperaquine or artemether-lumefantrine, plus single-dose primaquine, and were followed for 42 days. Mixed Plasmodium infections were included; P. vivax infections received 14 days of primaquine. We retrospectively restricted the analysis to cases with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed parasitemia. Recurrent parasitemia in follow-up was identified by species-specific nested PCR.
   Results. Of the 3731 participants screened, 302 were enrolled and randomized. In the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm, P. falciparum infections were confirmed by PCR in 59 participants, with mixed infections in 23 (39.0%). In the artemetherlumefantrine arm, P. falciparum infections were confirmed by PCR in 55 participants, with mixed infections in 16 (29.0%). Both regimens were well tolerated, and symptoms improved rapidly in all treated participants. In the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm, 1 P. falciparum recurrence (on day 7) and 6 P. malariae recurrences (1 had a mixed infection with P. falciparum) were identified during days 3-42 of follow-up. In the artemether-lumefantrine arm, 1 P. falciparum/P. malariae/P. vivax recurrence occurred on day 35. Submicroscopic persistence occurred during follow-up in 21 (37%) of 57 receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and 20 (39%) of 51 receiving artemether-lumefantrine.
   Conclusions. In Sumatera, both regimens effectively cleared initial parasitemia, but P. falciparum and P. malariae persisted in some individuals. Molecular species detection should be deployed in antimalarial efficacy trials in Indonesia.

TI Improving the efficiency of reactive case detection for malaria
   elimination in southern Zambia: a cross-sectional study
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Reactive case detection (RCD) seeks to enhance malaria surveillance and control by identifying and treating parasitaemic individuals residing near index cases. In Zambia, this strategy starts with passive detection of symptomatic incident malaria cases at local health facilities or by community health workers, with subsequent home visits to screen-and-treat residents in the index case and neighbouring (secondary) households within a 140-m radius using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). However, a small circular radius may not be the most efficient strategy to identify parasitaemic individuals in low-endemic areas with hotspots of malaria transmission. To evaluate if RCD efficiency could be improved by increasing the probability of identifying parasitaemic residents, environmental risk factors and a larger screening radius (250 m) were assessed in a region of low malaria endemicity. Methods Between January 12, 2015 and July 26, 2017, 4170 individuals residing in 158 index and 531 secondary households were enrolled and completed a baseline questionnaire in the catchment area of Macha Hospital in Choma District, Southern Province, Zambia. Plasmodium falciparum prevalence was measured using PfHRP2 RDTs and quantitative PCR (qPCR). A Quickbird (TM) high-resolution satellite image of the catchment area was used to create environmental risk factors in ArcGIS, and generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate associations between risk factors and secondary households with parasitaemic individuals. Results The parasite prevalence in secondary (non-index case) households was 0.7% by RDT and 1.8% by qPCR. Overall, 8.5% (n = 45) of secondary households had at least one resident with parasitaemia by qPCR or RDT. The risk of a secondary household having a parasitaemic resident was significantly increased in proximity to higher order streams and marginally with increasing distance from index households. The adjusted OR for proximity to third- and fifth-order streams were 2.97 (95% CI 1.04-8.42) and 2.30 (95% CI 1.04-5.09), respectively, and that for distance to index households for each 50 m was 1.24 (95% CI 0.98-1.58). Conclusion Applying proximity to streams as a screening tool, 16% (n = 3) more malaria-positive secondary households were identified compared to using a 140-m circular screening radius. This analysis highlights the potential use of environmental risk factors as a screening strategy to increase RCD efficiency.

TI Evaluation of human-baited double net trap and human-odour-baited CDC
   light trap for outdoor host-seeking malaria vector surveillance in Kenya
   and Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Surveillance of outdoor host-seeking malaria vectors is crucial to monitor changes in vector biting behaviour and evaluate the impact of vector control interventions. Human landing catch (HLC) has been considered the most reliable and gold standard surveillance method to estimate human-biting rates. However, it is labour-intensive, and its use is facing an increasing ethical concern due to potential risk of exposure to infectious mosquito bites. Thus, alternative methods are required. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of human-odour-baited CDC light trap (HBLT) and human-baited double net trap (HDNT) for outdoor host-seeking malaria vector surveillance in Kenya and Ethiopia. Methods The sampling efficiency of HBLT and HDNT was compared with CDC light trap and HLC using Latin Square Design in Ahero and Iguhu sites, western Kenya and Bulbul site, southwestern Ethiopia between November 2015 and December 2018. The differences in Anopheles mosquito density among the trapping methods were compared using generalized linear model. Results Overall, 16,963 female Anopheles mosquitoes comprising Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), Anopheles funestus s.l., Anopheles pharoensis, Anopheles coustani and Anopheles squamosus were collected. PCR results (n = 552) showed that Anopheles arabiensis was the only member of An. gambiae s.l. in Ahero and Bulbul, while 15.7% An. arabiensis and 84.3% An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) constituted An. gambiae s.l. in Iguhu. In Ahero, HBLT captured 2.23 times as many An. arabiensis and 2.11 times as many An. funestus as CDC light trap. In the same site, HDNT yielded 3.43 times more An. arabiensis and 3.24 times more An. funestus than HBLT. In Iguhu, the density of Anopheles mosquitoes did not vary between the traps (p > 0.05). In Bulbul, HBLT caught 2.19 times as many An. arabiensis as CDC light trap, while HDNT caught 6.53 times as many An. arabiensis as CDC light trap. The mean density of An. arabiensis did not vary between HDNT and HLC (p = 0.098), whereas the HLC yielded significantly higher density of An. arabiensis compared to HBLT and CDC light trap. There was a significant density-independent positive correlation between HDNT and HLC (r = 0.69). Conclusion This study revealed that both HBLT and HDNT caught higher density of malaria vectors than conventional CDC light trap. Moreover, HDNT yielded a similar vector density as HLC, suggesting that it could be an alternative tool to HLC for outdoor host-seeking malaria vector surveillance.

TI Molecular surveillance of the Pfmdr1 N86Y allele among Congolese
   pregnant women with asymptomatic malaria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria in pregnancy is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Regular surveillance of artemisinin-based combination therapy tolerance, or molecular makers of resistance, is vital for effective malaria treatment, control and eradication programmes. Plasmodium falciparum multiple drug resistance-1 gene (Pfmdr1) N86Y mutation is associated with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine. This study assessed the prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86Y in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. Methods A total 1001 of P. falciparum-infected blood samples obtained from asymptomatic malaria pregnant women having a normal child delivery at the Madibou Integrated Health Centre were analysed. Pfmdr1 N86Y genotyping was conducted using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results The wild type Pfmdr1 N86 allele was predominant (> 68%) in this study, whereas a few isolates carrying the either the mutant allele (Pfmdr1 86Y) alone or both alleles (mixed genotype). The dominance of the wildtype allele (pfmdr1 N86) indicates the plausible decline P. falciparum susceptibility to lumefantrine. Conclusion This study gives an update on the prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86Y alleles in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. It also raises concern on the imminent emergence of resistance against artemether-lumefantrine in this setting. This study underscores the importance to regular artemether-lumefantrine efficacy monitoring to inform the malaria control programme of the Republic of Congo.

TI Characterization of Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinases 3, a Protein
   Involved in Growth of Cryptosporidium parvum
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are considered promising targets for pharmaceutical intervention of cryptosporidiosis. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed the presence of several CDPKs (CpCDPKs) in Cryptosporidium parvum. In this study, we expressed recombinant CpCDPK3 encoded by the cgd5_820 gene in Escherichia coli. The biologic characteristics and functions of CpCDPK3 were examined using qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and in vitro neutralization assay. The expression of the cgd5_820 gene peaked in merozoites during in vitro culture while the CpCDPK3 protein was expressed in both sporozoites and merozoites. Polyclonal antibodies against CpCDPK3 showed no significant inhibitory effects on host invasion by the parasites. We assessed the inhibitory effects of 46 candidate compounds from molecular docking of CpCDPK3 on both C. parvum development and CpCDPK3 enzyme activities. One compound was identified to be effective. Results of these analyses suggest that CpCDPK3 might play an important role in the growth of C. parvum.

TI Rapid diagnostic tests failing to detect infections by Plasmodium
   falciparum encoding pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in a non-endemic setting
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting the histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) have a central position for the management of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Yet, variable detection of certain targeted motifs, low parasitaemia, but also deletion of pfhrp2 gene or its homologue pfhrp3, may result in false-negative RDT leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. This study aimed at investigating the prevalence, and understanding the possible causes, of P. falciparum RDT-negative infections at Montpellier Academic Hospital, France. Methods The prevalence of falsely-negative RDT results reported before and after the introduction of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, as part as the malaria screening strategy in January 2017, was analysed. Negative P. falciparum RDT infections were screened for pfhrp2 or pfhrp3 deletion; and exons 2 were sequenced to show a putative genetic diversity impairing PfHRP2 detection. Results The overall prevalence of P. falciparum negative RDTs from January 2006 to December 2018 was low (3/446). Whereas no cases were reported from 2006 to 2016 (0/373), period during which the malaria diagnostic screen was based on microscopy and RDT, prevalence increased up to 4.1% (3/73) between 2017 and 2018, when molecular detection was implemented for primary screening. Neither pfhrp2/3 deletion nor major variation in the frequency of repetitive epitopes could explain these false-negative RDT results. Conclusion This paper demonstrates the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in three P. falciparum RDT-negative infections and reviews the possible reasons for non-detection of HRP2/3 antigens in a non-endemic setting. It highlights the emergence of falsely negative rapid diagnostic tests in a non-endemic setting and draws attention on the risk of missing malaria cases with low parasitaemia infections using the RDT plus microscopy-based strategy currently recommended by French authorities. The relevance of a novel diagnostic scheme based upon a LAMP assay is discussed.

TI Development of copy number assays for detection and surveillance of
   piperaquine resistance associated plasmepsin 2/3 copy number variation
   in Plasmodium falciparum
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Long regarded as an epicenter of drug-resistant malaria, Southeast Asia continues to provide new challenges to the control of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Recently, resistance to the artemisinin combination therapy partner drug piperaquine has been observed in multiple locations across Southeast Asia. Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as copy number variations in the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes, which encode haemoglobin-degrading proteases that associate with clinical and in vitro piperaquine resistance. Results To accurately and quickly determine the presence of copy number variations in the plasmepsin 2/3 genes in field isolates, this study developed a quantitative PCR assay using TaqMan probes. Copy number estimates were validated using a separate SYBR green-based quantitative PCR assay as well as a novel PCR-based breakpoint assay to detect the hybrid gene product. Field samples from 2012 to 2015 across three sites in Cambodia were tested using DNA extracted from dried blood spots and whole blood to monitor the extent of plasmepsin 2/3 gene amplifications, as well as amplifications in the multidrug resistance transporter 1 gene (pfmdr1), a marker of mefloquine resistance. This study found high concordance across all methods of copy number detection. For samples derived from dried blood spots, a success rate greater than 80% was found in each assay, with more recent samples performing better. Evidence of extensive plasmepsin 2/3 copy number amplifications was observed in Pursat (94%, 2015) (Western Cambodia) and Preah Vihear (87%, 2014) (Northern Cambodia), and lower levels in Ratanakiri (16%, 2014) (Eastern Cambodia). A shift was observed from two copies of plasmepsin 2 in Pursat in 2013 to three copies in 2014-2015 (25% to 64%). Pfmdr1 amplifications were absent in all samples from Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri in 2014 and absent in Pursat in 2015. Conclusions The multiplex TaqMan assay is a robust tool for monitoring both plasmepsin 2/3 and pfmdr1 copy number variations in field isolates, and the SYBR-green and breakpoint assays are useful for monitoring plasmepsin 2/3 amplifications. This study shows increasing levels of plasmepsin 2 copy numbers across Cambodia from 2012 to 2015 and a complete reversion of multicopy pfmdr1 parasites to single copy parasites in all study locations.

TI Pyronaridine-artesunate Efficacy and Safety in Uncomplicated Plasmodium
   falciparum Malaria in Areas of Artemisinin-resistant Falciparum in Viet
   Nam (2017-2018)
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum undermines the efficacy of currently deployed antimalarial therapies in southern Viet Nam.
   Methods. Between May 2017 and December 2018, this prospective, open-label, single-arm, observational clinical trial, conducted in Binh Phuoc, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Khanh Hoa, and Ninh Thuan provinces, evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral pyronaridine-artesunate once daily for 3 consecutive days in adults and children with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria. Patients were treated as inpatients for Days 0-3, with follow-up visits on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. The primary outcome was the proportion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 42.
   Results. The cumulative incidence of PCR-adjusted ACPR at Day 42 was 96.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.4-98.2; Kaplan-Meier). In the per-protocol analysis, the proportion of patients with Day 42 PCR-adjusted ACPR was 96.1% (147/153; 95% CI 91.7-98.5). The proportion of patients with parasitemia at Day 3 was 24.0% (40/167; 95% CI 17.7-31.2). The prevalences of the Kelch13 (C580Y) mutation were: in Binh Phuoc, 97.7% (43/44); in Dak Nong, 96.2% (25/26); in Gia Lai, 57.8% (37/64); in Khanh Hoa, 66.6% (6/9); and in Ninh Thuan, 3.6% (1/28). The majority of artemisinin-resistant isolates also had increased plasmepsin2 copy number (75.9%; 85/112). There was 1 isolate (Binh Phuoc) that had Kelch13 (C580Y) plus increased plasmepsin2 and Pfmdr1 copy numbers. Asymptomatic transient increases in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were observed at Day 7, resolving by Day 28.
   Conclusions. Pyronaridine-artesunate can be used to diversify antimalarial therapy in areas of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in Viet Nam.

TI Genetic polymorphism of merozoite surface protein-3 in Myanmar
   Plasmodium falciparum field isolates
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-3 (PfMSP-3) is a target of naturally acquired immunity against P. falciparum infection and is a promising vaccine candidate because of its critical role in the erythrocyte invasion of the parasite. Understanding the genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 is important for recognizing genetic nature and evolutionary aspect of the gene in the natural P. falciparum population and for designing an effective vaccine based on the antigen. Methods Blood samples collected from P. falciparum-infected patients in Naung Cho and Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar, in 2015 were used in this study. The pfmsp-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were analysed using the programs DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP 5.10.00. Genetic diversity and natural selection of the global pfmsp-3 were also comparatively analysed. Results Myanmar pfmsp-3 displayed 2 different alleles, 3D7 and K1. The 3D7 allelic type was predominant in the population, but genetic polymorphism was less diverse than for the K1 allelic type. Polymorphic characters in both allelic types were caused by amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Amino acid substitutions were mainly occurred at the alanine heptad repeat domains, whereas most insertions and deletions were found at the glutamate rich domain. Overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar in the global pfmsp-3 population, but novel amino acid changes were observed in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with low frequencies. Complicated patterns of natural selection and recombination events were predicted in the global pfmsp-3, which may act as major driving forces to maintain and generate genetic diversity of the global pfmsp-3 population. Conclusion Global pfmsp-3 revealed genetic polymorphisms, suggesting that the functional and structural consequences of the polymorphisms should be considered in designing a vaccine based on PfMSP-3. Further examination of genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 in the global P. falciparum population is necessary to gain in-depth insight for the population structure and evolutionary aspect of global pfmsp-3.

TI Bacterial Microbiome in Wild-Caught Anopheles Mosquitoes in Western
   Thailand
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Among the complex microbial community living in the mosquito midgut, some bacteria (e.g., Enterobacter spp.) can deliver effector molecules with anti-Plasmodium effects suppressing the development of malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) before the ookinete can penetrate the mosquito midgut epithelium. Despite knowledge of this phenomenon, only a few studies have defined the diversity of microbiota in wild-caught adult Anopheles species. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the bacterial microbiota in different Anopheles species, including representatives of the primary malaria vectors in western Thailand. Wild female Anopheles species were sampled from malaria-endemic areas in Tak and Mae Hong Son provinces near the Thai-Myanmar border. Midgut/abdominal bacterial diversity was assessed by examining the 16S rRNA gene, V3 hypervariable region, using PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) profiling and sequence analysis. A total of 24 bacterial genera were identified from eight Anopheles species. Five bacterial genera were newly reported in Anopheles mosquitoes (Ferrimonas, Megasphaera, Pectobacterium, Shimwellia, and Trabulsiella). Five genera, including Megasphaera, were detected exclusively in a single-malaria (Plasmodium vivax) infected Anopheles minimus and not observed in other non-infected mosquitoes. The use of PCR-TTGE provides the first characterization of the midgut bacterial microbiome present in wild adult Anopheles in Thailand. Evidence that microbiota might impact pathogen development (suppression) in Anopheles and thereby reduce the risk of pathogen transmission deserves more studies to describe the presence and better understand the biological role of bacteria in natural mosquito populations.

TI Prevalence and clinical impact of malaria infections detected with a
   highly sensitive HRP2 rapid diagnostic test in Beninese pregnant women
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background While sub-microscopic malarial infections are frequent and potentially deleterious during pregnancy, routine molecular detection is still not feasible. This study aimed to assess the performance of a Histidine Rich Protein 2 (HRP2)-based ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT, Alere Malaria Ag Pf) for the detection of infections of low parasite density in pregnant women. Methods This was a retrospective study based on samples collected in Benin from 2014 to 2017. A total of 942 whole blood samples collected in 327 women in the 1st and 3rd trimesters and at delivery were tested by uRDT, conventional RDT (cRDT, SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag Pf), microscopy, quantitative polymerase chain-reaction (qPCR) and Luminex-based suspension array technology targeting P. falciparum HRP2. The performance of each RDT was evaluated using qPCR as reference standard. The association between infections detected by uRDT, but not by cRDT, with poor maternal and birth outcomes was assessed using multivariate regression models. Results The overall positivity rate detected by cRDT, uRDT, and qPCR was 11.6% (109/942), 16.2% (153/942) and 18.3% (172/942), respectively. Out of 172 qPCR-positive samples, 68 were uRDT-negative. uRDT had a significantly better sensitivity (60.5% [52.7-67.8]) than cRDT (44.2% [36.6-51.9]) and a marginally decreased specificity (93.6% [91.7-95.3] versus 95.7% [94.0-97.0]). The gain in sensitivity was particularly high (33%) and statistically significant in the 1st trimester. Only 28 (41%) out of the 68 samples which were qPCR-positive, but uRDT-negative had detectable but very low levels of HRP2 (191 ng/mL). Infections that were detected by uRDT but not by cRDT were associated with a 3.4-times (95%CI 1.29-9.19) increased risk of anaemia during pregnancy. Conclusions This study demonstrates the higher performance of uRDT, as compared to cRDTs, to detect low parasite density P. falciparum infections during pregnancy, particularly in the 1st trimester. uRDT allowed the detection of infections associated with maternal anaemia.

TI Prevalence of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations in Plasmodium falciparum
   associated with drug resistance among pregnant women receiving IPTp-SP
   at Msambweni County Referral Hospital, Kwale County, Kenya
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy is crucial in dealing with maternal mortality and adverse fetal outcomes. The World Health Organization recommendation to treat all pregnant women with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) through antenatal care structures was implemented in Kenya in the year 1998, but concerns about its effectiveness in preventing malaria in pregnancy has arisen due to the spread of SP resistant parasites. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of SP resistance markers in Plasmodium falciparum parasites isolated from pregnant women seeking antenatal care at Msambweni County Referral Hospital, located in coastal Kenya, between the year 2013 and 2015. Methods This hospital-based study included 106 malaria positive whole blood samples for analysis of SP resistance markers within the Pfdhfr gene (codons 51, 59 and 108) and Pfdhps gene (codons 437 and 540). The venous blood collected from all pregnant women was tested for malaria via light microscopy, then the malaria positive samples were separated into plasma and red cells and stored in a - 86 degrees freezer for further studies. Archived red blood cells were processed for molecular characterization of SP resistance markers within the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes using real time PCR platform and Sanger sequencing. Results All samples had at least one mutation in the genes associated with drug resistance; polymorphism prevalence of Pfdhfr51I, 59R and 108N was at 88.7%, 78.3% and 93.4%, respectively, while Pfdhps polymorphism accounted for 94.3% and 91.5% at 437G and 540E, respectively. Quintuple mutations (at all the five codons) conferring total SP resistance had the highest prevalence of 85.8%. Quadruple mutations were observed at a frequency of 10.4%, and 24.5% had a mixed outcome of both wildtype and mutant genotypes in the genes of interest. Conclusion The data suggest a high prevalence of P. falciparum genetic variations conferring resistance to SP among pregnant women, which may explain reduced efficacy of IPTp treatment in Kenya. There is need for extensive SP resistance profiling in Kenya to inform IPTp drug choices for successful malaria prevention during pregnancy.

TI Molecular assessment of kelch13 non-synonymous mutations in Plasmodium
   falciparum isolates from Central African Republic (2017-2019)
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Over the last decade, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has contributed substantially to the decrease in malaria-related morbidity and mortality. The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to artemisinin derivatives in Southeast Asia and the risk of their spread or of local emergence in sub-Saharan Africa are a major threat to public health. This study thus set out to estimate the proportion of P. falciparum isolates, with Pfkelch13 gene mutations associated with artemisinin resistance previously detected in Southeast Asia. Methods Blood samples were collected in two sites of Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic (CAR) from 2017 to 2019. DNA was extracted and nested PCR were carried out to detect Plasmodium species and mutations in the propeller domain of the Pfkelch13 gene for P. falciparum samples. Results A total of 255 P. falciparum samples were analysed. Plasmodium ovale DNA was found in four samples (1.57%, 4/255). Among the 187 samples with interpretable Pfkelch13 sequences, four samples presented a mutation (2.1%, 4/187), including one non-synonymous mutation (Y653N) (0.5%, 1/187). This mutation has never been described as associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia and its in vitro phenotype is unknown. Conclusion This preliminary study indicates the absence of Pfkelch13 mutant associated with artemisinin resistance in Bangui. However, this limited study needs to be extended by collecting samples across the whole country along with the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo phenotype profiles of Pfkelch13 mutant parasites to estimate the risk of artemisinin resistance in the CAR.

TI Utility of Plasmodium falciparum DNA from rapid diagnostic test kits for
   molecular analysis and whole genome amplification
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become the most common diagnostic tool for detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, in particular in remote areas. RDT blood spots provide a source of parasite DNA for molecular analysis. In this study, the utility of RDTs for molecular analysis and the performance of different methods for whole genome amplification were investigated. Methods Positive P. falciparum RDTs were collected from Kayin, Myanmar from August 2014 to January 2016. The RDT samples were stored for 6 months, 9 months, 20 months, 21 months, and 32 months before DNA extraction and subsequent molecular analysis of P. falciparum kelch 13 (pfkelch13) mutations, P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pfplasmepsin2) gene amplification. In addition, performance of four whole genome amplification (WGA) kits were compared, including REPLI-g(R), MALBAC(TM), PicoPLEX(R), and GenomePlex(R), for which DNA quantity and quality were compared between original DNA and post-WGA products. Results The proportion of successful amplification of the different molecular markers was similar between blood spots analysed from RDTs stored for 6, 9, 20, 21, or 32 months. Successful amplification was dependent on the molecular markers fragment length (p value < 0.05): 18% for a 1245 bp fragment of pfkelch13, 71% for 364 bp of pfkelch13, 81% for 87 bp of pfmdr1, 81% for 108 bp of pfplasmepsin2. Comparison of the four WGA assay kits showed that REPLI-g(R), MALBAC(TM), and PicoPLEX(R) increased the quantity of DNA 60 to 750-fold, whereas the ratio of parasite DNA amplification over human DNA was most favourable for MALBAC(R). Sequencing results of pfkelch13, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and six microsatellite markers assessed from the post-WGA product was the same as from the original DNA. Conclusions Blood spots from RDTs are a good source for molecular analysis of P. falciparum, even after storage up to 32 months. WGA of RDT-derived parasite DNA reliably increase DNA quantity with sufficient quality for molecular analysis of resistance markers.

TI Joint selection for two malaria resistance mutations in a south-west
   Colombian population
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB In regions with an Afro-descendant population and where malaria is endemic, high frequencies of polymorphisms have been found that confer resistance to this disease, such as the haemoglobin S (HbS) and Duffy genes, which provide resistance to P. falciparum and P. vivax infection, respectively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the individual and joint selection actions of these two genes in an Afro-descendant Colombian population. A total of 819 individuals were analysed using stratified random sampling. PCR-RFLP and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium deviation analysis (H-W eq.), linkage disequilibrium (LD), D'(2)(IS) and D'(2)(ST) indexes, neutrality tests, correlations and fitness were performed using Arlequin 3.5.2.2 and R 3.4.1 software. In general, the population showed neutrality and H-W eq. for the HbS gene but not for the Duffy gene (FYA/FYB, FYA/FYB Es and FYB/FYB Es genotypes were responsible for this deviation). LD between the HbS locus and the promoter region of the Duffy gene, a value D'(2)(IS) = 0.001 and D'(2)(ST) = 0.020 was found, an increase in fitness of the AS*FYB Es /FYB Es genotype combination (marked in adolescents and adults), and a strong correlation between these genotypes (Rho = 90%, p = .001) were found, evidencing a possible joint selection action for these two alleles. This work presents evidence of the action of natural selection, both individually and jointly, on malaria resistance genes, HbS and Duffy, in the Buenaventura population.

TI Significant Efficacy of a Single Low Dose of Primaquine Compared to
   Stand-Alone Artemisinin Combination Therapy in Reducing Gametocyte
   Carriage in Cambodian Patients with Uncomplicated Multidrug-Resistant
   Plasmodium falciparum Malaria
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Since 2012, a single low dose of primaquine (SLDPQ; 0.25 mg/kg of body weight) with artemisinin-based combination therapies has been recommended as the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria to interrupt its transmission, especially in low-transmission settings of multidrug resistance, including artemisinin resistance. Policy makers in Cambodia have been reluctant to implement this recommendation due to primaquine safety concerns and a lack of data on its efficacy. In this randomized controlled trial, 109 Cambodians with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) alone or combined with SLDPQ on the first treatment day. The transmission-blocking efficacy of SLDPQ was evaluated on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, and recrudescence by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (gametocyte prevalence) and membrane feeding assays with Anopheles minimus mosquitoes (gametocyte infectivity). Without the influence of recrudescent infections, DP-SLDPQ reduced gametocyte carriage 3-fold compared to that achieved with DP. Of 48 patients tested on day 0, only 3 patients were infectious to mosquitoes (similar to 6%). Posttreatment, three patients were infectious on day 14 (3.5%, 1/29) and on the 1st and 7th days of recrudescence (8.3%, 1/12 for each); this overall low infectivity precluded our ability to assess its transmission-blocking efficacy. Our study confirms the effective gametocyte clearance of SLDPQ when combined with DP in multidrug-resistant P. falciparum infections and the negative impact of recrudescent infections due to poor DP efficacy. Artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) has replaced DP, and ASMQ-SLDPQ has been deployed to treat all patients with symptomatic P. falciparum infections to further support the elimination of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum in Cambodia.

TI Multiplex Human Malaria Array: Quantifying Antigens for Malaria Rapid
   Diagnostics
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Malaria antigen detection through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is widely used to diagnose malaria and estimate prevalence. To support more sensitive next-generation RDT development and screen asymptomatic malaria, we developed and evaluated the Q-Plex (TM) Human Malaria Array (Quansys Biosciences, Logan, UT), which quantifies the antigens commonly used in RDTs-Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), P. falciparum-specific lactate dehydrogenase (Pf LDH), Plasmodium vivax-specific LDH (Pv LDH), and Pan malaria lactate dehydrogenase (Pan LDH), and human C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of severity in malaria. At threshold levels yielding 99.5% or more diagnostic specificity, diagnostic sensitivities against polymerase chain reaction-confirmed malaria for HRP2, Pf LDH, Pv LDH, and Pan LDH were 92.7%, 71.5%, 46.1%, and 83.8%, respectively. P. falciparum culture strains and samples from Peru indicated that HRP2 and Pf LDH combined improves detection of P. falciparum parasites with hrp2 and hrp3 deletions. This array can be used for antigen-based malaria screening and detecting hrp2/3 deletion mutants of P. falciparum.

TI Different Plasmodium falciparum clearance times in two Malian villages
   following artesunate monotherapy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Artemisinin resistance described as increased parasite clearance time (PCT) is rare in Africa. More sensitive methods such as qPCR might better characterize the clearance phenotype in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: PCT is explored in Mali using light microscopy and qPCR after artesunate for uncomplicated malaria. In two villages, patients were followed for 28 days. Blood smears and spots were collected respectively for microscopy and qPCR. Parasitemia slope half-life was calculated after microscopy. Patient residual parasitemia were measured by qPCR.
   Results: Uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPR) observed in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau were 78% and 92%, respectively (p = 0.01). This reached 100% for both after molecular correction.
   Proportions of 24H microscopy positive patients in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau were 97.2% and 72%, respectively (p < 0.0001).
   Slope half-life was 2.8 h in Faladje vs 2H in Bougoula-Hameau (p < 0.001) and Proportions of 72H patients with residual parasitemia were 68.5% and 40% in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau, respectively (p = 0.003). The mean residual parasitemia was 2.9 in Faladje vs. 0.008 in Bougoula-Hameau (p = 0.002).
   Although artesunate is efficacious in Mali, the longer parasite clearance time with submicroscopic parasitemia observed may represent early signs of developing P. falciparum resistance to artemisinins.

TI Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapy and the
   implications of Pfkelch13 and Pfcoronin molecular markers in treatment
   failure in Senegal
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In 2006, Senegal adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment in the management of uncomplicated malaria. This study aimed to update the status of antimalarial efficacy more than ten years after their first introduction. This was a randomized, three-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in Senegal. Malaria suspected patients were screened, enrolled, treated, and followed for 28 days for AL and ASAQ arms or 42 days for DP arm. Clinical and parasitological responses were assessed following antimalarial treatment. Genotyping (msp1, msp2 and 24 SNP-based barcode) were done to differentiate recrudescence from re-infection; in case of PCR-confirmed treatment failure, Pfk13 propeller and Pfcoronin genes were sequenced. Data was entered and analyzed using the WHO Excel-based application. A total of 496 patients were enrolled. In Diourbel, PCR non-corrected/corrected adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPR) was 100.0% in both the AL and ASAQ arms. In Kedougou, PCR corrected ACPR values were 98.8%, 100% and 97.6% in AL, ASAQ and DP arms respectively. No Pfk13 or Pfcoronin mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were found. This study showed that AL, ASAQ and DP remain efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Senegal.

TI Novel Methods for Diagnosis Of Blood-Borne Protozoa
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF THERAPEUTICS
AB The majority of parasitic infections are generally described in tropical and subtropical climate regions but affect developed countries due to the increase in migration and international travel. They may cause growth and development retardation in children, and labour and power loss in adults. As a result, rapid and reliable diagnosis forms the priority step for early treatment. In recent years, new and rapid diagnostic methods for diagnosis of blood parasites have been developed. Among these methods, serologic testing, rapid antigen tests, new nucleic acid amplification tests and proteomic methods come to the fore. In this review, methods still used for diagnosis of blood parasites are mentioned in brief and newly developed or developing methods are discussed.

TI High value of rapid diagnostic tests to diagnose malaria within
   children: A systematic review meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background Children aged under five years accounted for 61% of all malaria deaths worldwide in 2017, and quicker differential, diagnosis of malaria fever is vital for them. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are strips to detect Plasmodium-specific antigens promptly and are helpful in resource-limited areas. Thus, our aim is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for malaria in children against. the gold standard.
   Methods MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Sinomed databases were systematically searched on August 23, 2019. Studies that compared RDTs wit It microscopy or polymerase chain reaction in malaria diagnoses for children were eligible. Relevant data were extracted. The quality of studies was evaluated using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies instrument. Meta-analyses were carried out to calculate the pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals of sensitivity and specificity.
   Results 51 articles were included. For diagnostic accuracy, the pooled estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs were 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.90, 0.95) and 0.93 (95% CI = 0.90, 0.96) respectively. Studies were highly heterogeneous, and subgroup analyses showed that the application of RDTs in high malaria transmission areas had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than those in low-to-moderate areas.
   Conclusions RDTs have high accuracy for malaria diagnosis in children, and this characteristic is more prominent in high transmission areas. As they also have the advantages of rapid-detection, are easy-to-use, and can be cost-effective, it is recommended that the wider usage of RDTs should be promoted, especially in resource-limited areas. Further research is required to assess their performance in WHO South-East Asia and Americas Region.

TI Droplet Digital PCR for the Detection of Plasmodium falciparum DNA in
   Whole Blood and Serum: A Comparative Analysis with Other Molecular
   Methods
SO PATHOGENS
AB Background: The estimation ofPlasmodium falciparumparasitaemia can vary according to the method used. Recently, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been proposed as a promising approach in the molecular quantitation ofPlasmodium, but its ability to predict the actual parasitaemia on clinical samples has not been largely investigated. Moreover, the possibility of applying the ddPCR-sensitive method to serum samples has never been explored. Methods: We used, for the first time, ddPCR on both blood and serum to detect the DNA ofP. falciparumin 52 paired samples from 26 patients. ddPCR was compared with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rtPCR. The correlation between the ddPCR results, microscopy, and clinical parameters was examined. Results: ddPCR and microscopy were found to be strongly correlated (rho(26) = 0.83111, p<0.0001) in blood. Samples deviating from the correlation were partially explained by clinical parameters. In serum samples, ddPCR revealed the best performance in detectingP. falciparumDNA, with 77% positive samples among malaria subjects. Conclusion: Absolute quantitation by ddPCR can be a flexible technique forPlasmodiumdetection, with potential application in the diagnosis of malaria. In particular, ddPCR is a powerful approach forPlasmodiumDNA analysis on serum when blood samples are unavailable.

CA Italian Malaria Surveillance Grp
TI Non-imported malaria in Italy: paradigmatic approaches and public health
   implications following an unusual cluster of cases in 2017
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB BackgroundThe European region achieved interruption of malaria transmission during the 1970s. Since then, malaria control programs were replaced by surveillance systems in order to prevent possible re-emergence of this disease. Sporadic cases of non-imported malaria were recorded in several European countries in the past decade and locally transmitted outbreaks of Plasmodium vivax, most probably supported by Anopheles sacharovi, have been repeatedly reported from Greece since 2009. The possibility of locally-transmitted malaria has been extensively studied in Italy where the former malaria vector An. labranchiae survived the control campaign which led to malaria elimination. In this study, we present paradigmatic cases that occurred during a 2017 unusual cluster, which caused strong concern in public opinion and were carefully investigated after the implementation of the updated malaria surveillance system.MethodsFor suspected locally-transmitted malaria cases, alerts to Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Institute of Health (ISS) were mandated by the Local Health Services (LHS). Epidemiological investigations on the transmission modes and the identification of possible infection's source were carried out by LHS, MoH and ISS. Entomological investigations were implemented locally for all suspected locally-transmitted cases that occurred in periods suitable to anopheline activity. Molecular diagnosis by nested-PCR for the five human Plasmodium species was performed to support microscopic diagnosis. In addition, genotyping of P. falciparum isolate was carried out to investigate putative sources of infection and transmission modalities.ResultsIn 2017, a cluster of seven non-imported cases was recorded from August through October. Among them, P. ovale curtisi was responsible of one case whereas six cases were caused by P. falciparum. Two cases were proved to be nosocomial while the other five were recorded as cryptic at the end of epidemiological investigations.ConclusionsThe epidemiological evidence shows that the locally acquired events are sporadic, often remain unresolved and classified as cryptic ones despite investigative efforts. The "cluster" of seven non-imported cases that occurred in 2017 in different regions of Italy therefore represents a conscious alert that should lead us to maintain a constant level of surveillance in a former malaria endemic country.

TI Surveillance of the Efficacy of Artemisinin-Piperaquine in the Treatment
   of UncomplicatedPlasmodium falciparumMalaria Among Children Under 5
   Years of Age in Est-Mono District, Togo, in 2017
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB Background Malaria is a major public health concern in Togo. The Est-Mono district of Togo has a population of 150,000. Accordingly, the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, China and the Ministry of Health and Social Security, Togo launched a nationwide Mass Drug Administration Project with artemisinin-piperaquine (AP) in Est-Mono. Before launching this project, the sensitivity test of AP was conducted in a general clinic in Elawagnon, Togo. With this background, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of AP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children under the age of 5 years. Methods Children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled in this study. The selected patients were treated with a combination regime of artemisinin-piperaquine. The patients were followed up for 28 days, during which signs of the following were observed for: the duration for fever clearance, parasitemia density, gametophyte generation, cure rate, hemoglobin level, andmerozoite surface protein-2(msp-2)polymorphism. The primary end point was a 28-day cure rate and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected reinfection and recrudescence. This research followed the standardized World Health Organization (WHO) protocol for the assessment of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs. Results A total of 91 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled in this study. Adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPRs) before and after PCR-correction were 66 (73%) and 90 (99%), respectively. The average hemoglobin level in the patient increased by 0.05 g/dl per day (p < 0.0001) after the treatment. The gametophyte generation did not decline at the beginning of the treatment; however, after 14 days, it declined (day 21: p < 0.05; day 28: p < 0.01). In themsp-2polymorphism study of 24 children treated for parasite infection, one case ofmsp-2with3D7haplotype andFC27haplotype was noted, indicating its recrudescence, with a frequency of 4%. The remaining 23 cases could have been of reinfection, with a frequency of 96%. No serious adverse reactions occurred, and AP was well-tolerated by all patients. Conclusion Artemisinin-piperaquine was found to be an effective combination for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children aged <5 years in Togo, and the drugs were well-tolerated. In Togo,Plasmodium falciparumremains sensitive to artemisinin-piperaquine, necessitating its trial in this region.

TI Surveillance of genetic markers associated with Plasmodium falciparum
   resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy in Pakistan,
   2018-2019
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The spread of artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia poses a significant threat for current anti-malarial treatment guidelines globally. The aim of this study was to assess the current prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in the four provinces with the highest malaria burden in Pakistan, after introducing artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment in 2017. Methods Samples were collected during routine malaria surveillance in Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces of Pakistan between January 2018 and February 2019. Plasmodium falciparum infections were confirmed by rapid diagnostic test or microscopy. Plasmodium falciparum positive isolates (n = 179) were screened by Sanger sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum kelch 13 (pfk13) propeller domain and in P. falciparum coronin (pfcoronin). SNPs in P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) N86Y, Y184F, D1246Y and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) K76T were genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results No artemisinin resistance associated SNPs were identified in the pfk13 propeller domain or in pfcoronin. The pfmdr1 N86, 184F, D1246 and pfcrt K76 alleles associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity were present in 83.8% (150/179), 16.9% (29/172), 100.0% (173/173), and 8.4% (15/179) of all infections, respectively. The chloroquine resistance associated pfcrt 76T allele was present in 98.3% (176/179) of infections. Conclusion This study provides an update on the current prevalence of molecular markers associated with reduced P. falciparum sensitivity to artemether and/or lumefantrine in Pakistan, including a first baseline assessment of polymorphisms in pfcoronin. No mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were observed in pfk13 or pfcoronin. However, the prevalence of the pfmdr1 N86 and D1246 alleles, that have been associated with decreased susceptibility to lumefantrine, remain high. Although clinical and molecular data suggest that the current malaria treatment guidelines for P. falciparum are presently effective in Pakistan, close monitoring for artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance will be critical to ensure early detection and enhanced containment of emerging ACT resistance spreading across from Southeast Asia.

TI Comparison of real time and malachite-green based loop-mediated
   isothermal amplification assays for the detection ofPlasmodium
   vivaxandP.falciparum
SO PLOS ONE
AB The current context of malaria elimination requires urgent development and implementation of highly sensitive and specific methods for prompt detection and treatment of malaria parasites. Such methods should overcome current delays in diagnosis, allow the detection of low-density infections and address the difficulties in accessing remote endemic communities. In this study, we assessed the performance of the RealAmp and malachite-green loop mediated isothermal amplification (MG-LAMP) methodologies, using microscopy and conventional nested-PCR as reference techniques. Both LAMP techniques were performed for Plasmodium genus,P.falciparum, andP.vivaxidentification using 136 whole blood samples collected from three communities located in the Peruvian Amazon basin. Turnaround time and costs of performing the LAMP assays were estimated and compared to that of microscopy and nested-PCR. Using nested-PCR as reference standard, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all methods. RealAmp had a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI: 85-96.5%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 89.1-100%) for species detection; sensitivity and specificity of MG-LAMP were 94% (95% CI: 87.5-97.8%) and 100% (89.1-100%), respectively. Whereas microscopy showed 88.1% sensitivity (95% CI: 80.2-93.7%) and 100% specificity (95%: 89.1-100%). The turnaround time and costs of performing the LAMP assays were lower compared to those associated with nested-PCR but higher than those associated with microscopy. The two LAMP assays were shown to be more sensitive and simple to implement than microscopy. Both LAMP methodologies could be used as large-scale screening tests, but the MG-LAMP assay uses a simple, portable heat-block while the RealAmp requires a RealAmp machine or a real-time PCR machine. This makes the MG-LAMP an appropriate choice for malaria surveillance studies in endemic sites. Use of LAMP tests in active case detection ofPlasmodiumparasites could help to detect positive malaria cases early.

TI Influx of diverse, drug resistant and transmissiblePlasmodium
   falciparuminto a malaria-free setting in Qatar
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background Successful control programs have impeded local malaria transmission in almost all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, a prodigious influx of imported malaria via migrant workers sustains the threat of local transmission. Here we examine the origin of imported malaria in Qatar, assess genetic diversity and the prevalence of drug resistance genes in importedPlasmodium falciparum,and finally, address the potential for the reintroduction of local transmission. Methods This study examined imported malaria cases reported in Qatar, between 2013 and 2016. We focused onP. falciparuminfections and estimated both total parasite and gametocyte density, using qPCR and qRT-PCR, respectively. We also examined ten neutral microsatellites and four genes associated with drug resistance,Pfmrp1,Pfcrt,Pfmdr1, andPfkelch13,to assess the genetic diversity of importedP. falciparumstrains, and the potential for propagating drug resistance genotypes respectively. Results The majority of imported malaria cases wereP. vivax, whileP. falciparumand mixed species infections (P. falciparum/P. vivax) were less frequent. The primary origin ofP. vivaxinfection was the Indian subcontinent, whileP. falciparumwas mostly presented by African expatriates. ImportedP. falciparumstrains were highly diverse, carrying multiple genotypes, and infections also presented with early- and late-stage gametocytes. We observed a high prevalence of mutations implicated in drug resistance among these strains, including novel SNPs inPfkelch13. Conclusions The influx of genetically diverseP. falciparum,with multiple drug resistance markers and a high capacity for gametocyte production, represents a threat for the reestablishment of drug-resistant malaria into GCC countries. This scenario highlights the impact of mass international migration on the reintroduction of malaria to areas with absent or limited local transmission.

TI Serologic Markers of Previous Malaria Exposure and Functional Antibodies
   Inhibiting Parasite Growth Are Associated With Parasite Kinetics
   Following a Plasmodium falciparum Controlled Human Infection
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. We assessed the impact of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum on parasite kinetics, clinical symptoms, and functional immunity after controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in 2 cohorts with different levels of previous malarial exposure.
   Methods. Nine adult males with high (sero-high) and 10 with low (sero-low) previous exposure received 3200 P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) of PfSPZ Challenge by direct venous inoculation and were followed for 35 days for parasitemia by thick blood smear (TBS) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Endpoints were time to parasitemia, adverse events, and immune responses.
   Results. Ten of 10 (100%) volunteers in the sero-low and 7 of 9 (77.8%) in the sero-high group developed parasitemia detected by TBS in the first 28 days (P=.125). The median time to parasitemia was significantly shorter in the sero-low group than the serohigh group (9 days [interquartile range {IQR} 7.5-11.0] vs 11.0 days [IQR 7.5-18.0], respectively; log-rank test, P=.005). Antibody recognition of sporozoites was significantly higher in the sero-high (median, 17.93 [IQR 12.95-24] arbitrary units [AU]) than the sero-low volunteers (median, 10.54 [IQR, 8.36-12.12] AU) (P=.006). Growth inhibitory activity was significantly higher in the serohigh (median, 21.8% [IQR, 8.15%-29.65%]) than in the sero-low group (median, 8.3% [IQR, 5.6%-10.23%]) (P=.025).
   Conclusions. CHMI was safe and well tolerated in this population. Individuals with serological evidence of higher malaria exposure were able to better control infection and had higher parasite growth inhibitory activity.

TI Plasma cell-free DNA predicts pediatric cerebral malaria severity
SO JCI INSIGHT
AB BACKGROUND. Prediction of adverse outcomes in cerebral malaria (CM) is difficult. We hypothesized that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels would facilitate identification of severe and potentially fatal CM cases.
   METHODS. In this retrospective study, plasma from Malawian children with CM (n = 134), uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 77), and healthy controls (HC, n = 60) was assayed for cfDNA using a fluorescence assay. Host and parasite cfDNA was measured by quantitative PCR. Immune markers were determined by ELISA, Luminex, or cytometric bead array.
   RESULTS. Total cfDNA increased with malaria severity (HC versus UM, P < 0.001; HC versus CM, P < 0.0001; UM versus CM, P < 0.0001), was elevated in retinopathy-positive (Ret(+)) CM relative to Ret-CM (7.66 versus 5.47 ng/mu L, P = 0.027), and differentiated Ret(+) fatal cases from survivors (AUC 0.779; P < 0.001). cfDNA levels in patients with non-malarial febrile illness (NMF, P = 0.25) and non-malarial coma (NMC, P = 0.99) were comparable with UM. Host DNA, rather than parasite DNA, was the major cfDNA contributor (UM, 268 versus 67 pg/mu L; CM, 2824 versus 463 pg/mu L). Host and parasite cfDNA distinguished CM by retinopathy (host, AUC 0.715, P = 0.0001; parasite, AUC 0.745, P = 0.0001), but only host cfDNA distinguished fatal cases (AUC 0.715, P = 0.0001). Total cfDNA correlated with neutrophil markers IL-8 (r(s) = 0.433, P < 0.0001) and myeloperoxidase (r(s) = 0.683, P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSION. Quantifying plasma cfDNA is a simple assay useful in identifying children at risk for fatal outcome and has promise as a point-of-care assay. Elevated cfDNA suggests a link with host inflammatory pathways in fatal CM.

TI Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test for diagnosis of
   uncomplicated malaria in endemic areas: a meta-analysis of diagnostic
   test accuracy
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background The global malaria decline has stalled and only a few countries are pushing towards pre-elimination. The aim of the malaria elimination phase is interruption of local transmission of a specified malaria parasite in a defined geographical area. New and improved screening tools and strategies are required for detection and management of very low-density parasitaemia in the field. The objective of this study was to synthesize evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test for the detection of malaria parasites among people living in endemic areas. Methods This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guideline. Relevant studies in the health-related electronic databases were searched. According to the criteria set for this study, eligible studies were identified. The quality of included studies was evaluated with the use of a quality assessment checklist. A summary performance estimates such as pooled sensitivity and specificity were stratified by type of LAMP. Bivariate model for data analyses was applied. Summary receiver operating characteristics plots were created to display the results of individual studies in a receiver operating characteristics space. Meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity among individual studies. Results Twenty-seven studies across 17 endemic countries were identified. The vast majority of studies were with unclear risk of bias in the selection of index test. Overall, the pooled test performances were high forPanLAMP (sensitivity: 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.97; specificity: 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99),Plasmodium falciparum(Pf) LAMP (sensitivity: 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98; specificity: 0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00) or forPlasmodium vivax(Pv) LAMP from 6 studies (sensitivity: 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99; specificity: 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00). The area under the curve for Pan LAMP (0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00),PfLAMP (0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) andPvLAMP was (1.00, 95% CI 0.98-1.00) indicated that the diagnostic performance of these tests were within the excellent accuracy range. Meta-regression analysis showed that sample size had the greatest impact on test performance, among other factors. Conclusions The current findings suggest that LAMP-based assays are appropriate for detecting low-level malaria parasite infections in the field and would become valuable tools for malaria control and elimination programmes. Future well-designed larger sample studies on LAMP assessment in passive and active malaria surveillances that use PCR as the reference standard and provide sufficient data to construct 2 x 2 diagnostic table are needed.

TI Asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium falciparum by individuals with
   variant blood groups and haemoglobin genotypes in southern Ghana
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe ABO and the Rhesus blood group systems, as well as various abnormal haemoglobin (Hb) variants (haemoglobinopathies) are known to influence malaria parasite carriage and disease severity in individuals living in malaria endemic areas. This study identified the blood group and Hb variant distribution and Plasmodium falciparum infection status of afebrile individuals living in southern Ghana.MethodsAfebrile participants were recruited from Obom (358) in the Greater Accra Region and Ewim (100) and Simiw (329) in the Central Region of Ghana. Venous blood (1 ml) was collected into EDTA vacutainer tubes. Three 20 mu l drops of blood were used for blood group analysis using the tile method. Another 500 mu l aliquot was used for the qualitative sickling test using sodium metabisulphite and haemoglobin electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 mu l of whole blood and used in P. falciparum species-specific PCR.ResultsThe most abundant blood group and abnormal haemoglobin variant in both sites was blood group O+(47.4%) and HbAS (15.8%). A total of 13 (1.7%) of the participants had full haemoglobinopathies (SS, SC and CC), whilst 196 (25.4%) were carriers (AS and AC). Although there was a significantly higher prevalence of sickling positive participants from the Central Region, genotyping identified a similar prevalence of each of the abnormal haemoglobin genes in both sites. Asymptomatic parasite carriage estimated by PCR was 40.9% in the Central Region and 41.8% in the Greater Accra Region.ConclusionsAsymptomatic carriage of P. falciparum parasite in the study population was not associated with any particular blood group variant or haemoglobin genotype.

TI Parasite clearance, cure rate, post-treatment prophylaxis and safety of
   standard 3-day versus an extended 6-day treatment of
   artemether-lumefantrine and a single low-dose primaquine for
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Bagamoyo district,
   Tanzania: a randomized controlled trial
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundArtemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) resistant Plasmodium falciparum represents an increasing threat to Africa. Extended ACT regimens from standard 3 to 6 days may represent a means to prevent its development and potential spread in Africa.MethodsStandard 3-day treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (control) was compared to extended 6-day treatment and single low-dose primaquine (intervention); in a randomized controlled, parallel group, superiority clinical trial of patients aged 1-65 years with microscopy confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, enrolled in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. The study evaluated parasite clearance, including proportion of PCR detectable P. falciparum on days 5 and 7 (primary endpoint), cure rate, post-treatment prophylaxis, safety and tolerability. Clinical, and laboratory assessments, including ECG were conducted during 42 days of follow-up. Blood samples were collected for parasite detection (by microscopy and PCR), molecular genotyping and pharmacokinetic analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were done for both parasite clearance and recurrence.ResultsA total of 280 patients were enrolled, 141 and 139 in the control and intervention arm, respectively, of whom 121 completed 42 days follow-up in each arm. There was no difference in proportion of PCR positivity across the arms at day 5 (80/130 (61.5%) vs 89/134 (66.4%), p=0.44), or day 7 (71/129 (55.0%) vs 70/134 (52.2%), p=0.71). Day 42 microscopy determined cure rates (PCR adjusted) were 97.4% (100/103) and 98.3% (110/112), p=0.65, in the control and intervention arm, respectively. Microscopy determined crude recurrent parasitaemia during follow-up was 21/121 (17.4%) in the control and 14/121 (11.6%) in the intervention arm, p=0.20, and it took 34 days and 42 days in the respective arms for 90% of the patients to remain without recurrent parasitaemia. Lumefantrine exposure was significantly higher in intervention arm from D3 to D42, but cardiac, biochemical and haematological safety was high and similar in both arms.ConclusionExtended 6-day artemether-lumefantrine treatment and a single low-dose of primaquine was not superior to standard 3-day treatment for ACT sensitive P. falciparum infections but, importantly, equally efficacious and safe. Thus, extended artemether-lumefantrine treatment may be considered as a future treatment regimen for ACT resistant P. falciparum, to prolong the therapeutic lifespan of ACT in Africa.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03241901.

TI Assays for quantification of male and female gametocytes in human blood
   by qRT-PCR in the absence of pure sex-specific gametocyte standards
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundMalaria transmission from humans to Anopheles mosquitoes requires the presence of gametocytes in human peripheral circulation, and the dynamics of transmission are determined largely by the density and sex ratio of the gametocytes. Molecular methods are thus employed to measure gametocyte densities, particularly when assessing transmission epidemiology and the efficacy of transmission-blocking interventions. However, accurate quantification of male and female gametocytes with molecular methods requires pure male and female gametocytes as reference standards, which are not widely available.MethodsqRT-PCR assays were used to quantify levels of sex-specific mRNA transcripts in Plasmodium falciparum female and male gametocytes (pfs25 and pfMGET, respectively) using synthetic complimentary RNA standards and in vitro cultured gametocytes. Assays were validated and assay performance was investigated in blood samples of clinical trial participants using these standards and compared to absolute quantification by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).ResultsThe number of transcript copies per gametocyte were determined to be 279.3 (95% CI 253.5-307.6) for the female-specific transcript pfs25, and 12.5 (95% CI 10.6-14.9) for the male-specific transcript pfMGET. These numbers can be used to convert from transcript copies/mL to gametocyte/mL. The reportable range was determined to be 5.71x10(6) to 5.71 female gametocytes/mL for pfs25, and 1.73x10(7) to 1.73x10(1) male gametocytes/mL for pfMGET. The limit of detection was 3.9 (95% CI 2.5-8.2) female gametocytes/mL for pfs25, and 26.9 (95% CI 19.3-51.7) male gametocytes/mL for PfMGET. Both assays showed minimal intra-assay and inter-assay variability with coefficient of variation<3%. No cross-reactivity was observed in both assays in uninfected human blood samples. Comparison of results from ddPCR to qRT-PCR assays on clinical blood samples indicated a high-level agreement (ICC=0.998 for pfs25 and 0.995 for pfMGET).ConclusionsThis study reports the validation of qRT-PCR assays that are able to accurately quantify female and male P. falciparum gametocytes at sub-microscopic densities. The assays showed excellent reproducibility, sensitivity, precision, specificity, and accuracy. The methodology will enable the estimation of gametocyte density in the absence of pure female and male gametocyte standards, and will facilitate clinical trials and epidemiological studies.

TI Prevalence and proportion of Plasmodium spp. triple mixed infections
   compared with double mixed infections: a systematic review and
   meta-analysis
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundAlthough mixed infection by two Plasmodium species has been recognized, mixed infection by three different Plasmodium species within one individual has not been clarified. This study sought to determine the pooled prevalence and proportion of triple mixed Plasmodium spp. infection compared with double mixed infection.MethodsArticles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for cross-sectional studies of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species and then were retrieved and extracted. The pooled proportion and prevalence of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species were subjected to random-effects analysis. The secondary outcomes were differences in the pooled proportion between triple mixed infection and double mixed infection by Plasmodium species reported in the included studies.ResultsOf 5621 identified studies, triple mixed infection data were available for 35 records, including 601 patients from 22 countries. The overall pooled prevalence of triple mixed infection was 4% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3-5%; I-2=92.5%). The pooled proportion of triple mixed infection compared with double mixed infection was 12% (95% CI 9-18; I-2=91%). Most of the included studies (29/35; 82.9%) presented a lower proportion of triple mixed infection than double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the proportion of triple mixed infection was the highest in Oceania (23%; 95% CI 15-36%) and Europe (21%; 95% CI 5-86%), but the lowest in the USA (3%; 95% CI 2-4%). Moreover, the proportion of triple mixed infection was higher in residents (20%; 95% CI 14-29%) than in febrile patients (7%; 95% CI 4-13%), when compared with the proportion of double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis of the age groups demonstrated that, compared with the proportion of double mixed infection, triple mixed infection was lower in patients aged <= 5 years (OR=0.27; 95% CI 0.13-0.56; I-2=31%) and>5 years (OR=0.09; 95% CI 0.04-0.25, I-2=78%).ConclusionsThe present study suggested that, in areas where triple mixed infection were endemic, PCR or molecular diagnosis for all residents in communities where malaria is submicroscopic can provide prevalence data and intervention measures, as well as prevent disease transmission and enhance malaria elimination efforts.

TI Presence of additionalPlasmodium vivaxmalaria in Duffy negative
   individuals from Southwestern Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is thought to be mostly caused byPlasmodium falciparum. Recently, growing reports of cases due toPlasmodium ovale,Plasmodium malariae, andPlasmodium vivaxhave been increasingly observed to play a role in malaria epidemiology in sSA. This in fact is due to the usage of very sensitive diagnostic tools (e.g. PCR), which have highlighted the underestimation of non-falciparum malaria in this sub-region.Plasmodium vivaxwas historically thought to be absent in sSA due to the high prevalence of the Duffy negativity in individuals residing in this sub-continent. Recent studies reporting detection of vivax malaria in Duffy-negative individuals from Mali, Mauritania, Cameroon challenge this notion. Methods Following previous report ofP. vivaxin Duffy-negative individuals in Nigeria, samples were further collected and assessed RDT and/or microscopy. Thereafter, malaria positive samples were subjected to conventional PCR method and DNA sequencing to confirm both single/mixed infections as well as the Duffy status of the individuals. Results Amplification ofPlasmodiumgDNA was successful in 59.9% (145/242) of the evaluated isolates and as expectedP. falciparumwas the most predominant (91.7%) species identified. Interestingly, fourP. vivaxisolates were identified either as single (3) or mixed (oneP. falciparum/P. vivax) infection. Sequencing results confirmed all vivax isolates as truly vivax malaria and the patient were of Duffy-negative genotype. Conclusion Identification of additional vivax isolates among Duffy-negative individuals from Nigeria, substantiate the expanding body of evidence on the ability ofP. vivaxto infect RBCs that do not express the DARC gene. Hence, such genetic-epidemiological study should be conducted at the country level in order to evaluate the true burden ofP. vivaxin Nigeria.

TI Submicroscopic malaria infection is not associated with fever in
   cross-sectional studies in Malawi
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background SubmicroscopicPlasmodium falciparuminfections are widespread in many areas. However, the contribution of these infections to symptomatic malaria is not well understood. This study evaluated whether participants with submicroscopicP.falciparuminfections have higher prevalence of fever than uninfected participants in southern Malawi. Methods A total of 16,650 children and adults were enrolled in the course of six cross-sectional surveys during the dry season (October-November) and after the rainy season (April-May) between 2012 and 2014 in three districts in southern Malawi. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected in conjunction with data on clinical histories, use of malaria preventive measures, and anti-malarial medication taken within 2 weeks of the survey. Axillary temperatures were measured, and blood samples were collected forP. falciparumdetection by microscopy and PCR. Participants without malaria parasites detected on microscopy but with a positive PCR forP. falciparumwere defined as having submicroscopic infection. Fever was defined as having any one of: reported fever in the past 2 weeks, reported fever in the past 48 h, or a temperature of >= 37.5 degrees C measured at the time of interview. Results SubmicroscopicP. falciparuminfections and fever were both detected in 9% of the study population. In the final analysis adjusted for clustering within household and enumeration area, having submicroscopicP. falciparuminfection was associated with reduced odds of fever in the dry season (odds ratio = 0.52; 95% CI 0.33-0.82); the association in the rainy season did not achieve statistical significance (odds ratio = 1.20; 95% CI 0.91-1.59). The association between submicroscopic infection and fever was consistent across all age groups. When the definition of fever was limited to temperature of >= 37.5 degrees C measured at the time of interview, the association was not statistically significant in either the rainy or dry season. Conclusions In this series of cross-sectional studies in southern Malawi, submicroscopicP. falciparuminfection was not associated with increased risk of fever. Submicroscopic detection of the malaria parasite is important in efforts to decrease transmission but is not essential for the clinical recognition of malaria disease.

TI Transcriptome analysis of Anopheles dirus and Plasmodium vivax at
   ookinete and oocyst stages
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium parasites through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. One of the most important mosquito vectors in the Greater Mekong Subregion is Anopheles dirus. This study reports RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptome analysis of An. dirus at 18 hours and 7 days after a P. vivax-infected blood meal, which represent infection at the ookinete and oocyst parasite developmental stages, respectively. Following infection, 582 An. dirus transcripts were modulated. The 2,408 P. vivax transcripts could be classified into ookinete-specific, two-stage, and oocyst-specific groups. Results were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology analysis of the vector and parasite revealed several biological pathways for both, providing a better understanding of Anopheles-Plasmodium interactions at the ookinete and oocyst stages.

AB Background. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Plasmodium falciparum malaria coinfections. However, the role of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also endemic in Africa, has not been evaluated as a cofactor in eBL pathogenesis.
   Methods. Multiplexed seroprofiles for EBV, malaria, and KSHV were generated for 266 eBL patients, 78 non-eBL cancers, and 202 healthy children. KSHV and EBV loads were quantified by PCR.
   Results. KSHV seroprevalence did not differ by study group but was associated with age. Seropositivity, defined by K8.1/LANA or in combination with 5 other KSHV antigens (ORF59, ORF65, ORF61, ORF38, and K5) was associated with antimalarial antibody levels to AMA1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.41, P < .001; OR, 2.07, P < .001) and MSP1 (OR, 2.41, P = .0006; OR, 5.78, P < .001), respectively. KSHV loads did not correlate with antibody levels nor differ across groups but were significantly lower in children with detectable EBV viremia (P = .014).
   Conclusions. Although KSHV-EBV dual infection does not increase eBL risk, EBV appears to suppress reactivation of KSHV while malaria exposure is associated with KSHV infection and/or reactivation. Both EBV and malaria should, therefore, be considered as potential effect modifiers for KSHV-associated cancers in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Survey of asymptomatic malaria and mosquito vectors in Muang Khua
   District of Phongsaly Province, China-Laos Border
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Objectives: The China-Laos border has been identified as an important origin of imported malaria outside China. The aim of this study was to describe the asymptomatic malaria infections and epidemic trend of malaria in the China-Laos border region.
   Methods: A prevalence survey and surveillance of mosquito vectors was conducted in Muang Khua District of Phongsaly Province, China-Laos border, to determine the parasite carriage rate using nested PCR and microscopy. The species composition of malaria vectors was determined by overnight trapping. Blood samples were collected from 354 local residents aged 1-72 years in Sankang village in 2016. A total of 2430 adult mosquitoes were collected from four other villages in Muang Khua District from June to August 2016.
   Results: The parasite carriage rate was 7.63% (27/354) by microscopy or 7.91% (28/354) by nested PCR. The results of surveillance of the mosquito vectors revealed that the predominant genera of adult mosquitoes were Culex (69.92%, 1699/2430) and Anopheles (21.48%, 522/2430). Anopheles sinensis (82.95%, 433/522) was identified as the predominant species among the seven members of Anopheles found in this border region.
   Conclusions: A high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was present and the most important malaria vector was Anopheles sinensis, suggesting that the malaria epidemic situation on the China-Laos border is serious.

TI Malaria cross-sectional surveys identified asymptomatic infections of
   Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi in Surat
   Thani, a southern province of Thailand
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Objectives: Malaria cross-sectional surveys are rarely conducted in very low transmission settings. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of Plasmodium infection in a near-elimination setting in southern Thailand.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in areas of active transmission in the Surat Thani province of Thailand in January and May 2019. PCR was used to detect Plasmodium infection.
   Results: The prevalence of Plasmodium blood infection was 0.45% and 0.61% in January and May 2019, respectively. The major parasite species was Plasmodium falciparum in January and Plasmodium vivax in May. Unexpectedly, Plasmodium knowlesi infections were also detected. Most infections, including those of Plasmodium knowlesi, were asymptomatic. Being male and staying outdoors at night-time were the only significant identified risk factors. Of people infected in January 28.0% were positive in May for the same parasite species, suggesting persistent asymptomatic infections.
   Conclusions: Despite the very low incidence rate in Surat Thani, most malaria infections were asymptomatic. Outdoor mosquito biting at night-time is likely an important mode of malaria transmission. Unexpectedly, asymptomatic Plasmodium knowlesi infection was found, confirming previous reports of such infection in mainland Southeast Asia. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI Dynamics of Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum Infections Throughout
   Pregnancy: A Preconception Cohort Study in Benin
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. In the context of global malaria elimination efforts, special attention is being paid to submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infections. In pregnant, sub-Saharan African women, such infections are more prevalent than microscopic infections, and are thought to have adverse effects on both mothers' and newborns' health. However, no study has studied the dynamics and determinants of these infections throughout pregnancy. Retard de Croissance Intra-uterin et Paludisme (RECIPAL), a preconception cohort study carried out in Benin between 2014 and 2017, represented a unique opportunity to assess this issue.
   Methods. We used data from 273 pregnant Beninese women who were followed-up from preconception to delivery. We studied the dynamics of and factors influencing submicroscopic (and microscopic) P. falciparum infections during the 3 trimesters of pregnancy, using an ordinal logistic mixed model.
   Results. The incidence rate of submicroscopic P. falciparum infections during pregnancy was 12.7 per 100 person-months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.8-14.9), compared to 6.7 per 100 person-months (95% CI 5.5-8.1) for microscopic infections. The prevalences were highest in the first trimester for both submicroscopic and microscopic infections. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, we found that those of young age and those with a submicroscopic P. falciparum infection prior to pregnancy were at significantly higher risks of submicroscopic and microscopic infections throughout pregnancy, with a more pronounced effect in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Conclusions. The first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly high-risk period for P. falciparum infection during pregnancy, especially for the youngest women. Malaria prevention tools covering the preconception period and early pregnancy are urgently needed to better protect pregnant women and their newborns.

TI Novel Method for the Separation of Male and Female Gametocytes of the
   Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum That Enables Biological and Drug
   Discovery
SO MSPHERE
AB We developed a flow-cytometry-based method to separate and collect cocultured male and female Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes responsible for malaria transmission. The purity of the collected cells was estimated at >97% using flow cytometry, and sorted cells were observed by Giemsa-stained thin-smear and live-cell fluorescence microscopy. The expression of validated sex-specific markers corroborated the sorting strategy. Collected male and female gametocytes were used to confirm three novel sex-specific markers by quantitative real-time PCR that were more enriched in sorted male and female gametocyte populations than existing sex-specific markers. We also applied the method as a proof-of-principle drug screen that allows the identification of drugs that kill gametocytes in a sex-specific manner. Since the developed method allowed for the separation of male and female parasites from the same culture, we observed for the first time a difference in development time between the sexes: females developed faster than males. Hence, the ability to separate male and female gametocytes opens the door to a new field of sex-specific P. falciparum gametocyte biology to further our understanding of malaria transmission.
   IMPORTANCE The protozoan Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of human malaria. The development of sexual forms (so-called gametocytes) is crucial for disease transmission. However, knowledge of these forms is severely hampered by the paucity of sex-specific markers and the inability to extract single sex gametocytes in high purity. Moreover, the identification of compounds that specifically affect one sex is difficult due to the female bias of the gametocytes. We have developed a system that allows for the separation of male and female gametocytes from the same population. Applying our system, we show that male and female parasites mature at different rates, which might have implications for transmission. We also identified new sex-specific genes that can be used as sex markers or to unravel sex specific functions. Our system will not only aid in the discovery of much needed gametocidal compounds, but it also represents a valuable tool for exploring malaria transmission biology.

TI High-Resolution Melting Analysis in Comparison with Microscopic Method:
   An Experimental Study to Diagnosis of Plasmodium Species Infections in
   Human
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB Background: Among the human parasitic diseases, malaria is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. To prevent the high mortality and tracking malaria elimination efforts, a prompt and sensitive diagnosis is essential. This study aimed to compare High-Resolution Melting (HRM) and microscopic methods to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.
   Methods: Eighty-one blood samples were collected from patients with clinical symptoms who were suspect to malaria in Chabahar district, southeastern Iran and also, from those who were referred to Malaria National Laboratory in the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Microscopic examination and HRM method were used to the diagnosis of Plasmodium parasites simultaneously.
   Results: Microscopic results revealed 45 positive cases (12 P. fakiparum and 33 P. viva%) out of 81 collected samples while according to HRM analysis results 11 and 33 samples were identified as P. falaparum and P. vivax, respectively. HRM analysis also revealed 1 mixed infection of P. faldparum and P. malariae.
   Conclusion: HRM analysis provides a promising mean for simultaneous detection and discrimination of the Plasmodium spp. especially in mixed infection cases.

TI Investigating selected host and parasite factors potentially impacting
   upon seasonal malaria chemoprevention in Bama, Burkina Faso
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Since 2014, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ-SP) has been implemented on a large scale during the high malaria transmission season in Burkina Faso. This paper reports the prevalence of microscopic and submicroscopic malaria infection at the outset and after the first round of SMC in children under 5 years old in Bama, Burkina Faso, as well as host and parasite factors involved in mediating the efficacy and tolerability of SMC. Methods Two sequential cross-sectional surveys were conducted in late July and August 2017 during the first month of SMC in a rural area in southwest Burkina Faso. Blood smears and dried blood spots were collected from 106 to 93 children under five, respectively, at the start of SMC and again 3 weeks later. Malaria infection was detected by microscopy and by PCR from dried blood spots. For all children, day 7 plasma concentrations of desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) were measured and CYP2C8 genetic variants influencing AQ metabolism were genotyped. Samples were additionally genotyped forpfcrtK76T andpfmdr1N86Y, molecular markers associated with reduced amodiaquine susceptibility. Results 2.8% (3/106) of children were positive forPlasmodium falciparuminfection by microscopy and 13.2% (14/106) by nested PCR within 2 days of SMC administration. Three weeks after SMC administration, in the same households, 4.3% (4/93) of samples were positive by microscopy and 14.0% (13/93) by PCR (p = 0.0007). CYP2C8*2, associated with impaired amodiaquine metabolism, was common with an allelic frequency of 17.1% (95% CI 10.0-24.2). Day 7 concentration of DEAQ ranged from 0.48 to 362.80 ng/mL with a median concentration of 56.34 ng/mL.Pfmdr1N86 predominated at both time points, whilst a non-significant trend towards a higher prevalence ofpfcrt76T was seen at week 3. Conclusion This study showed a moderate prevalence of low-level malaria parasitaemia in children 3 weeks following SMC during the first month of administration. Day 7 concentrations of the active DEAQ metabolite varied widely, likely reflecting variability in adherence and possibly metabolism. These findings highlight factors that may contribute to the effectiveness of SMC in children in a high transmission setting.

TI Defining symptoms of malaria in India in an era of asymptomatic
   infections
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Malaria is a major public health problem in India. Data from surveys totaling 3031 participants at three sites revealed a high proportion of asymptomatic infections, complicating diagnosis. The aim of this study was to identify differences in complaints and symptoms between sites, and factors associated with asymptomaticPlasmodiuminfections. Methods Published data from community-based cross-sectional studies conducted between 2012 and 2015 in Nadiad (Gujarat), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), and Rourkela (Odisha) as part of the Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India were analysed. Complaints and symptoms were systematically recorded, andPlasmodiuminfections confirmed using microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between general symptoms and age, season, or gender, and factors associated with asymptomaticPlasmodiuminfections were assessed. Results Complaints of any illness were lowest in Chennai (17.7%), 30.6% in Rourkela and 42.7% in Nadiad. Complaints were more often reported for children; gender differences were noted in Rourkela only. In Nadiad, 7.0% of 796 participants were positive for malaria by PCR (32%Plasmodium falciparum); 78.6% had a history of fever or documented fever, 14.3% had other symptoms, and 7.1% were "truly asymptomatic". For Chennai this was 29.2%, 4.2% and 66.7% respectively, with a malaria prevalence of 2.6% by PCR of 928 participants (29%P. falciparum). In Rourkela, with 7.7% of 1307 participants positive for malaria by PCR (82%P. falciparum), the percentages were 35.6%, 24.8% and 39.6%, respectively. In Rourkela, asymptomatic infections were associated with young age and male gender (microscopy or RDT), and with rainy season (PCR). In the same site, participants withPlasmodium vivaxwere more likely to be asymptomatic (11/18 or 61.1%) than persons withP. falciparummono-infections (27/78 or 34.6%); gametocytes forP. falciparumwere evenly distributed between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (2/53 vs. 2/49, respectively). The addition of the symptoms "headache", "aches" and "chills" to fever improved the case-definition of symptomatic malaria. Conclusion There were considerable differences in complaints at the three sites in India. Malaria and asymptomatic infections differ by region, indicating that malaria elimination will require localized approaches.

SO JCI INSIGHT
AB Whole-sporozoite vaccines engender sterilizing immunity against malaria in animal models and importantly, in humans. Gene editing allows for the removal of specific parasite genes, enabling generation of genetically attenuated parasite (GAP) strains for vaccination. Using rodent malaria parasites, we have previously shown that late liver stage-arresting replication-competent (LARC) GAPs confer superior protection when compared with early liver stage-arresting replication-deficient GAPs and radiation-attenuated sporozoites. However, generating a LARC GAP in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) has been challenging. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a likely unprecedented P. falciparum LARC GAP generated by targeted gene deletion of the Mei2 gene: P. falciparum mei2(-). Robust exoerythrocytic schizogony with extensive cell growth and DNA replication was observed for P. falciparum mei2(-) liver stages in human liver-chimeric mice. However, P. falciparum mei2(-) liver stages failed to complete development and did not form infectious exoerythrocytic merozoites, thereby preventing their transition to asexual blood stage infection. Therefore, P. falciparum mei2(-) is a replication-competent, attenuated human malaria parasite strain with potentially increased potency, useful for vaccination to protect against P. falciparum malaria infection.

TI Therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of
   uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Chewaka District,
   Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundThe efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in south-western Ethiopia is poorly documented. Regular monitoring of drug efficacy is an important tool for supporting national treatment policies and practice. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of AL for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria in Ethiopia.MethodsThe study was a one-arm, prospective, evaluation of the clinical and parasitological, responses to directly observed treatment with AL among participants 6 months and older with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR reaction methods were used to quantify and genotype P. falciparum. A modified protocol based on the World Health Organization 2009 recommendations for the surveillance of anti-malarial drug efficacy was used for the study with primary outcomes, clinical and parasitological cure rates at day-28. Secondary outcomes assessed included patterns of fever and parasite clearance. Cure rate on day-28 was assessed by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis. Parasite genotyping was also performed at baseline and at the time of recurrence of parasitaemia to differentiate between recrudescence and new infection.ResultsOf the 80 study participants enrolled, 75 completed the follow-up at day-28 with ACPR. For per protocol (PP) analysis, PCR-uncorrected and-corrected cure rate of AL among the study participants was 94.7% (95% CI 87.1-98.5) and 96% (95% CI 88.8-99.2), respectively. For intention to treat (ITT) analysis, the cure rate was 90% (95% CI 88.8-99.2). Based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, the cumulative incidence of failure rate of AL was 3.8% (95% CI 1.3-11.4). Only three participants 3.8% (95% CI 0.8-10.6) of the 80 enrolled participants were found to be positive on day-3. The day three-positive participants were followed up to day 28 and did not correspond to treatment failures observed during follow-up. Only 7.5% (6/80) of the participants were gametocyte-positive on enrollment and gametocytaemia was absent on day-2 following treatment with AL.ConclusionsThe therapeutic efficacy of AL is considerably high (above 90%). AL remained highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the study area resulted in rapid fever and parasite clearance as well as low gametocyte carriage rates despite the use of this combination for more than 15 years.

TI High multiple mutations ofPlasmodium falciparum-resistant genotypes to
   sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in Lagos, Nigeria
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB Background Plasmodium falciparum-resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been largely reported among pregnant women. However, the profile of resistance markers to SP dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) in the general population are varied and not frequently monitored. Currently, SP is used as partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy (SP-artesunate) in some sub-Saharan African countries or as a prophylactic drug in intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy and infants and in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC). Profiling ofP. falciparum-resistant genotypes to SP is dynamic and critical in providing data that would be useful for malaria control programmes. This study assessed the profile ofdhfranddhpsgenes genotypes among individuals with malaria in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods Molecular markers of SP resistance were identified by nested PCR and sequenced among malaria positive dried blood spots (DBS) that were collected from individuals attending health facilities from January 2013 to February 2014 and during community surveys from October 2010 to September 2011 across different Local Government Areas of Lagos State, Nigeria. Results A total of 242 and 167 samples were sequenced fordhfranddhps, respectively. Sequence analysis ofdhfrshowed that 95.5% (231/242), 96.3% (233/242) and 96.7% (234/242) of the samples had N51I, C59R and S108N mutant alleles, respectively. The prevalence ofdhpsmutation at codons A437G, A613S, S436A, A581G, I431V and K540E were 95.8% (160/167), 41.9% (70/167), 41.3% (69/167), 31.1% (52/167), 25.1% (42/167), and 1.2% (2/167) respectively. The prevalence of triple mutations (CIRNI) indhfrwas 93.8% and 44.3% for the singledhpshaplotype mutation (SGKAA). Partial SP-resistance due to quadrupledhfr-dhpshaplotype mutations (CIRNI-SGKAA) and octuple haplotype mutations (CIRNI-VAGKGS) with rate of 42.6% and 22.0%, respectively has been reported. Conclusions There was increased prevalence indhfrtriple haplotype mutations when compared with previous reports in the same environment but aligned with high prevalence in other locations in Nigeria and other countries in Africa. Also, high prevalence ofdhfranddhpsmutant alleles occurred in the study areas in Lagos, Nigeria five to eight years after the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy underscores the need for continuous monitoring.

TI Polymorphism analysis of propeller domain ofk13gene inPlasmodium ovale
   curtisiandPlasmodium ovale wallikeriisolates original infection from
   Myanmar and Africa in Yunnan Province, China
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background Eighteen imported ovale malaria cases imported from Myanmar and various African countries have been reported in Yunnan Province, China from 2013 to 2018. All of them have been confirmed by morphological examination and 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) based PCR in YNRL. Nevertheless, the subtypes ofPlasmodium ovalecould not be identified based on 18S rRNA gene test, thus posing challenges on its accurate diagnosis. To help establish a more sensitive and specific method for the detection ofP. ovalegenes, this study performs sequence analysis onk13-propeller polymorphisms inP. ovale. Methods Dried blood spots (DBS) from ovale malaria cases were collected from January 2013 to December 2018, and the infection sources were confirmed according to epidemiological investigation. DNA was extracted, and the coding region (from 206th aa to 725th aa) ink13gene propeller domain was amplified using nested PCR. Subsequently, the amplified products were sequenced and compared with reference sequence to obtain CDS. The haplotypes and mutation loci of the CDS were analysed, and the spatial structure of the amino acid peptide chain ofk13gene propeller domain was predicted by SWISS-MODEL. Results The coding region from 224th aa to 725th aa ofk13gene fromP. ovalein 83.3% of collected samples (15/18) were amplified. Three haplotypes were observed in 15 samples, and the values of Ka/Ks, nucleic acid diversity index (pi) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 3.784, 0.0095, and 0.4250.Curtisihaplotype,Wallikerihaplotype, and mutant type accounted for 73.3% (11/15), 20.0% (3/15), and 6.7% (1/15). The predominant haplotypes ofP. ovale curtisiwere determined in all five Myanmar isolates. Of the ten African isolates, six were identified asP. o. curtisi, three wereP. o. wallikeriand one was mutant type. Base substitutions between the sequences ofP. o. curtisiandP. o. wallikeriwere determined at 38 loci, such as c.711. Moreover, the A > Tbase substitution at c.1428 was a nonsynonymous mutation, resulting in amino acid variation of T476S in the 476th position. Compared with sequence ofP. o. wallikeri, the double nonsynonymous mutations of G > Aand A > Tat the sites of c.1186 and c.1428 leads to the variations of D396N and T476S for the 396th and 476th amino acids positions. ForP. o. curtisiandP. o. wallikeri, the peptide chains in the coding region from 224th aa to 725th aa ofk13gene merely formed a monomeric spatial model, whereas the double-variant peptide chains of D396N and T476S formed homodimeric spatial model. Conclusion The propeller domain ofk13gene in theP. ovaleisolates imported into Yunnan Province from Myanmar and Africa showed high differentiation. The sequences of Myanmar-imported isolates belong toP. o. curtisi, while the sequences of African isolates showed the sympatric distribution fromP. o. curtisi,P. o. wallikeriand mutant isolates. The CDS with a double base substitution formed a dimeric spatial model to encode the peptide chain, which is completely different from the monomeric spatial structure to encode the peptide chain fromP. o. curtisiandP. o. wallikeri.

TI In Vitro Antiprotozoal Effects of Nano-chitosan on Plasmodium
   falciparum, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis
SO ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB Background Treatment of parasitic infections with conventional drugs is associated with high toxicity, and undesirable side effects require cogent substitutions. Nanotechnology has provided novel approaches to synthesize nano-drugs to improve efficient antipathetic treatment. Purpose Nano-chitosan as a nontoxic antimicrobial agent was examined against three most prevalent protozoa in humans,Plasmodium falciparum,Giardia lambliaandTrichomonas vaginalis.
   Methods Chitosan extracted fromPenicilliumfungi was converted to nanoparticles to maximize its therapeutic properties. Safety of nano-chitosan was examined by determining its hemolytic property and toxicity on PC12 cells. The studied parasites were identified with RFLP-PCR and cultivation in relevant media. Characteristics of nano-chitosan as an useful and valuable curative compound was evaluated by FTIR, DLS and SEM. Dose dependent anti-parasitic effect of nano-chitosan was evaluated.
   Results The highest anti-parasitic activity of the nano-chitosan was observed at 50 mu g/mL by which growth rates of cultivatedP. falciparum, T. vaginalis and G. lambliawere inhibited by 59.5%, 99.4%, and 31.3%, respectively. The study demonstrated that nano-chitosan with the least toxicity, low side effects, and substantial efficacy deserved to be considered as an anti-parasitic nano-compound.
   Conclusion Nano-chitosan significantly inhibited protozoan growth in vitro promising to explore its use to combat parasitic infections. Further investigations covering extended sample size,in vivo experiments and optimizing the concentration used may lead to efficient treatment of protozoan diseases.

TI An unlabelled probe-based real time PCR and modified semi-nested PCR as
   molecular tools for analysis of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium vivax
   isolates from Afghanistan
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB BackgroundPlasmodium vivax resistance to chloroquine (CQ) has been reported from many endemic regions in the world. Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 95% of malaria cases in Afghanistan and CQ is the first-line treatment given for vivax malaria. The pvmdr-1 and pvcrt-o (K10 insertion) genes are possible markers for CQ-resistance in P. vivax isolates. There have been no studies done on the presence or absence of molecular markers for CQ-resistance P. vivax in Afghanistan. The present work aimed to evaluate the frequency of mutations in the pvmdr-1 and K10 insertion in the pvcrt-o genes of P. vivax.MethodsPlasmodium vivax isolates were collected from Laghman, Baghlan and Khost provinces. For investigation of polymorphisms of desired regions in pvmdr-1 and pvcrt-o genes, sequencing was applied on the PCR products. A new asymmetric qPCR and melting analysis assay based on unlabelled probe developed for scanning of K10 insertion in pvcrt-o gene.ResultsThe analysis of sequencing data of the pvmdr-1 gene showed wild type Y976 and K997 and mutant M958 and L1076 in 33 isolates from three provinces. Of the 36 samples evaluated for K10 insertion in pvcrt-o, 2/18(11%), 0/10(0%) and 0/8(0%) isolates from Laghman, Baghlan and Khost province, respectively, possessed K10 insertion, confirmed by either sequencing and unlabelled probes.ConclusionTwo samples with K10 insertion and 33 samples with pvmdr1 polymorphism, indicating on the possibility of CQ resistance in P. vivax populations in Afghanistan. Furthermore, unlabelled probes are simple and inexpensive alternative tools for screening of P. vivax mutations.

TI Polymorphisms in Plasmodium vivax antifolate resistance markers in
   Afghanistan between 2007 and 2017
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax is the predominant Plasmodium species in Afghanistan. National guidelines recommend the combination of chloroquine and primaquine (CQ-PQ) for radical treatment of P. vivax malaria. Artesunate in combination with the antifolates sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria until 2016. Although SP has been the recommended treatment for falciparum and not vivax malaria, exposure of the P. vivax parasite population to SP might still have been quite extensive because of community based management of malaria. The change in the P. vivax antifolate resistance markers between 2007 and 2017 were investigated.
   Methods: Dried blood spots were collected (n=185) from confirmed P. vivax patients in five malaria-endemic areas of Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, including Takhar, Faryab, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Kunar, in 2007, 2010 and 2017. Semi-nested PCR, RFLP and nucleotide sequencing were used to assess the pyrimethamine resistant related mutations in P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr I13L, P33L, N50I, F57L, S58R, T61I, S93H, S117N, I173L) and the sulfonamide resistance related mutations in P. vivax dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps A383G, A553G).
   Results: In the 185 samples genotyped for pvdhfr and pvdhps mutations, 11 distinct haplotypes were observed, which evolved over time. In 2007, wild type pvdhfr and pvdhps were the most frequent haplotype in all study sites (81%, 80/99). However, in 2017, the frequency of the wild-type was reduced to 36%, (21/58; p value <= 0.001), with an increase in frequency of the double mutant pvdhfr and pvdhps haplotype S58RS117N (21%, 12/58), and the single pvdhfr mutant haplotype S117N (14%, 8/58). Triple and quadruple mutations were not found. In addition, pvdhfr mutations at position N50I (7%, 13/185) and the novel mutation S93H (6%, 11/185) were observed. Based on in silico protein modelling and molecular docking, the pvdhfr N50I mutation is expected to affect only moderately pyrimethamine binding, whereas the S93H mutation does not.
   Conclusions: In the course of ten years, there has been a strong increase in the frequency pyrimethamine resistance related mutations in pvdhfr in the P. vivax population in Afghanistan, although triple and quadruple mutations conferring high grade resistance were not observed. This suggests relatively low drug pressure from SP on the P. vivax parasite population in the study areas. The impact of two newly identified mutations in the pvdhfr gene on pyrimethamine resistance needs further investigation.

TI Polymorphisms of pfcrt, pfmdr1, and K13-propeller genes in imported
   falciparum malaria isolates from Africa in Guizhou province, China
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB BackgroundImported falciparum malaria from Africa has become a key public health challenge in Guizhou Province since 2012. Understanding the polymorphisms of molecular markers of drug resistance can guide selection of antimalarial drugs for the treatment of malaria. This study was aimed to analyze the polymorphisms of pfcrt, pfmdr1, and K13-propeller among imported falciparum malaria cases in Guizhou Province, China.MethodFifty-five imported falciparum malaria cases in Guizhou Province during 2012-2016 were included in this study. Their demographic information and filter paper blood samples were collected. Genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum was extracted from the blood samples, and polymorphisms of pfcrt, pfmdr1, and K13-propeller were analyzed with nested PCR amplification followed by sequencing. Data were analyzed with the SPSS17.0 software.ResultsThe prevalence of pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y, and pfmdr1 Y184F mutation was 56.6, 22.2, and 72.2%, respectively, in imported falciparum malaria cases in Guizhou Province. We detected two mutant haplotypes of pfcrt, IET and MNT, with IET being more commonly found (54.7%), and five mutant haplotypes of pfmdr1, of which NFD was the most frequent (53.7%). There were totally 10 combined haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1, of which the haplotype IETNFD possessed a predominance of 28.8%. In addition, three nonsynonymous mutations (S459T, C469F, and V692L) and two synonymous mutations (R471R and V589V) were detected in K13-propeller, all having prevalence less than 6.0%. In particular, a candidate K13 resistance mutation, C469F, was identified for the first time from Democratic Republic of the Congo with the prevalence of 2.0%.ConclusionsThe high prevalence of IET haplotype of pfcrt and NFD haplotype of pfmdr1 suggests the presence of chloroquine, artemether/lumefantrine, and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine resistance in these cases. Therefore cautions should be made to artemisinin therapy for P. falciparum in Africa. Continuous monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy in imported malaria cases is helpful for optimizing antimalarial drug therapy in Guizhou Province, China.

TI Adaptive interventions for optimizing malaria control: an implementation
   study protocol for a block-cluster randomized, sequential multiple
   assignment trial
SO TRIALS
AB BackgroundIn the past two decades, the massive scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) has led to significant reductions in malaria mortality and morbidity. Nonetheless, the malaria burden remains high, and a dozen countries in Africa show a trend of increasing malaria incidence over the past several years. This underscores the need to improve the effectiveness of interventions by optimizing first-line intervention tools and integrating newly approved products into control programs. Because transmission settings and vector ecologies vary from place to place, malaria interventions should be adapted and readapted over time in response to evolving malaria risks. An adaptive approach based on local malaria epidemiology and vector ecology may lead to significant reductions in malaria incidence and transmission risk.Methods/designThis study will use a longitudinal block-cluster sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design with longitudinal outcome measures for a period of 3years to develop an adaptive intervention for malaria control in western Kenya, the first adaptive trial for malaria control. The primary outcome is clinical malaria incidence rate. This will be a two-stage trial with 36 clusters for the initial trial. At the beginning of stage 1, all clusters will be randomized with equal probability to either LLIN, piperonyl butoxide-treated LLIN (PBO Nets), or LLIN + IRS by block randomization based on their respective malaria risks. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated with 12months of follow-up monitoring. At the end of the 12-month follow-up, clusters will be assessed for "response" versus "non-response" to PBO Nets or LLIN + IRS based on the change in clinical malaria incidence rate and a pre-defined threshold value of cost-effectiveness set by the Ministry of Health. At the beginning of stage 2, if an intervention was effective in stage 1, then the intervention will be continued. Non-responders to stage 1 PBO Net treatment will be randomized equally to either PBO Nets + LSM (larval source management) or an intervention determined by an enhanced reinforcement learning method. Similarly, non-responders to stage 1 LLIN + IRS treatment will be randomized equally to either LLIN + IRS + LSM or PBO Nets + IRS. There will be an 18-month evaluation follow-up period for stage 2 interventions. We will monitor indoor and outdoor vector abundance using light traps. Clinical malaria will be monitored through active case surveillance. Cost-effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed using Q-learning.DiscussionThis novel adaptive intervention strategy will optimize existing malaria vector control tools while allowing for the integration of new control products and approaches in the future to find the most cost-effective malaria control strategies in different settings. Given the urgent global need for optimization of malaria control tools, this study can have far-reaching implications for malaria control and elimination.Trial registrationUS National Institutes of Health, study ID NCT04182126.

TI Occurrence of septuple and elevatedPfdhfr-Pfdhpsquintuple mutations in a
   general population threatens the use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for
   malaria prevention during pregnancy in eastern-coast of Tanzania
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background Plasmodium falciparumdihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) mutations compromise the effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, and are likely to impair the efficiency of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp). This study was conducted to determine the level ofPfdhfr-Pfdhpsmutations, a decade since SP was limited for IPTp use in pregnant women in Tanzania. Methods P. falciparumgenomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots prepared from a finger prick. Extracted DNA were sequenced using a single MiSeq lane by combining all PCR products. Genotyping ofPfdhfrandPfdhpsmutations were done using bcftools whereas custom scripts were used to filter and translate genotypes into SP resistance haplotypes. Results ThePfdhfrwas analyzed from 445 samples, the wild type (WT)Pfdhfrhaplotype NCSI was detected in 6 (1.3%) samples. TriplePfdhfrIRNI (mutations are bolded and underlined) haplotype was dominant, contributing to 84% (number [n] = 374) of haplotypes while 446 samples were studied forPfdhps, WT forPfdhps(SAKAA) was found in 6.7% (n = 30) in samples. DoublePfdhpshaplotype (SGEAA) accounted for 83% of all mutations atPfdhpsgene. Of 447Pfdhfr-Pfdhpscombined genotypes, only 0.9% (n = 4) samples contained WT gene (SAKAA-NCSI). Quintuple (five) mutations, SGEAA-IRNI accounted for 71.4% (n = 319) whereas 0.2% (n = 1) had septuple (seven) mutations (AGKGS-IRNI). The overall prevalence ofPfdhfrK540E was 90.4% (n = 396) whilePfdhpsA581G was 1.1% (n = 5). Conclusions This study found high prevalence ofPfdhfr-Pfdhpsquintuple and presence of septuple mutations. Mutations atPfdhfrK540E andPfdhpsA581G, major predictors for IPTp-SP failure were within the recommended WHO range. Abandonment of IPTp-SP is recommended in settings where thePfdhfrK540E prevalence is > 95% andPfdhpsA581G is > 10% as SP is likely to be not effective. Nonetheless, saturation inPfdhfrandPfdhpshaplotypes is alarming, a search for alternative antimalarial drug for IPTp in the study area is recommended.

AB The use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as a source for nucleic acids that can be analyzed via nucleic acid amplification techniques has several advantages, including minimal amounts of blood, sample collection, simplified storage and shipping conditions at room temperature. We have systematically developed and extensively evaluated a procedure to extract total nucleic acids from used malaria RDTs. The co-extraction of DNA and RNA molecules from small volumes of dried blood retained on the RDTs allows detection and quantification of P. falciparum parasites from asymptomatic patients with parasite densities as low as 1 Pf/mu L blood using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Based on the extraction protocol we have developed the ENAR (Extraction of Nucleic Acids from RDTs) approach; a complete workflow for large-scale molecular malaria surveillance. Using RDTs collected during a malaria indicator survey we demonstrated that ENAR provides a powerful tool to analyze nucleic acids from thousands of RDTs in a standardized and high-throughput manner. We found several, known and new, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the propeller region of the kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.

TI Point prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection and the comparison
   of microscopy, rapid diagnostic test and nested PCR for the diagnosis of
   asymptomatic malaria among children under 5 years in Ghana
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background Plasmodiuminfection among children is a serious public health problem. Asymptomatic malaria infection among humans serves as a significant reservoir for transmittingPlasmodiumto uninfectedAnophelesmosquitoes, fueling malaria endemicity and asymptomatic malaria may progress to clinical malaria. Therefore, prompt and accurate diagnosis of malaria infection is crucial for the management and control of malaria, especially in endemic areas. This study assessed the point prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection and evaluated the performance of malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT), light microscopy and nested PCR (nPCR) for the diagnosis of asymptomatic malaria infection in a paediatric population in the Atwima Nwabiagya North district, Ghana. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 500 asymptomatic children aged <= 5 years. After consent was obtained from a parent, blood samples were collected from each participant to assess forPlasmodiuminfection based on histidine rich protein-2 (pfHRP-2)-based malaria RDT, light microscopy and nPCR. Results The point prevalence of asymptomatic malaria by microscopy, RDT, and nPCR were 116/500 (23.2%), 156/500 (31.2%), and 184/500 (36.8%), respectively. Using nPCR as the reference, RDT presented with a perfect sensitivity (100.0%), specificity (100.0%), accuracy (100.0%), and reliability (100.0%) in detecting asymptomaticP.falciparuminfection. Likewise, microscopy presented with an excellent specificity and high accuracy in detecting bothP.falciparum(100.0%; 85.6%) andP.malariae(100.0%; 100.0%). However, the sensitivity (56.4%) and reliability (56.4%) of microscopy was low for bothP.falciparum. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate a high point prevalence of asymptomaticPlasmodiuminfection among children in Atwima Nwabiagya North district, Ghana. In the absence of the more sensitive PCR, pfHRP-2-based malaria RDT provides substantial diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reliability and is superior to microscopy.

TI Summary of discordant results between rapid diagnosis tests, microscopy,
   and polymerase chain reaction for detecting Plasmodium mixed infection:
   a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used to detect malaria parasites among patients who suspected malaria infections in malaria-endemic areas where microscopy is unavailable. Nevertheless, little is known about the performance of RDTs in detecting Plasmodium mixed infections. The present study aimed to evaluate the discordant results between RDTs and microscopy/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in detecting Plasmodium mixed infections. The PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically reviewed to identify related studies that reported the performance of RDTs in detecting Plasmodium mixed infections. Studies were grouped according to the different RDT types including RDT type 2 (pf-HRP2/pan-aldolase), RDT type 3 (pf-HRP2/pan-pLDH), RDT type 4 (Pf-LDH/pan-pLDH), RDT type 5 (Pf/Pv-pLDH), and RDT type 6 (pf-HRP2/Pv-pLDH) for subgroup analysis. The estimates of the different proportions in each analysis group that were visually summarized in a forest plot showed the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Plots were drawn using RevMan (version 5.3; Cochrane Community). Twenty-eight studies were included in the present study. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that RDTs could detect a significantly higher proportion of Plasmodium mixed infections than microscopy (p=0.0007, OR=3.33, 95% CI 1.66-6.68). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that only RDTs targeting Pf-specific histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)/pan-specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) could detect a significantly higher proportion of Plasmodium mixed infections than microscopy (p=0.004, OR=8.46, 95% CI 2.75-26.1). The subgroup analysis between RDTs and PCR methods demonstrated that RDTs targeting Pf-specific HRP2/Pv-specific LDH could detect a significantly lower proportion of Plasmodium mixed infections than PCR methods (p=0.0005, OR=0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.68). This is the first study to summarize the discordant results between RDTs and microscopy/PCR in detecting Plasmodium mixed infections. Malaria RDTs targeting Pf-HRP2/pan-pLDH could detect a higher proportion of Plasmodium mixed infections than microscopy, while RDTs targeting Pf-HRP2/Pv-specific LDH could detect a lower proportion of Plasmodium mixed infections than PCR methods. The results of this study will support the selection and careful interpretations of RDTs for a better diagnosis of Plasmodium mixed-species infections and appropriate treatment of malaria patients in endemic and non-endemic settings.

TI Plasmodium falciparum isolate with histidine-rich protein 2 gene
   deletion from Nyala City, Western Sudan
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In remote areas of malaria-endemic countries, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have dramatically improved parasitological confirmation of suspected malaria cases, especially when skilled microscopists are not available. This study was designed to determine the frequency of Plasmodium falciparum isolates with histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene deletion as one of the possible factors contributing to the failure of PfHRP2-based RDTs in detecting malaria. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from several health centres in Nyala City, Western Sudan. The performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs in relation to microscopy was examined and the PCR-confirmed samples were investigated for the presence of pfhrp2 gene. A total of 113 out of 300 patients were P. falciparum positive by microscopy. Among them, 93.81% (106 out of 113) were positives by the PfHRP2 RDTs. Seven isolates were identified as false negative on the basis of the RDTs results. Only one isolate (0.9%; 1/113) potentially has pfhrp2 gene deletion. The sensitivity and specificity of PfHRP2-based RDTs were 93.81% and 100%, respectively. The results provide insights into the pfhrp2 gene deletion amongst P. falciparum population from Sudan. However, further studies with a large and systematic collection from different geographical settings across the country are needed.

TI Evaluation of highly sensitive diagnostic tools for the detection of P.
   falciparum in pregnant women attending antenatal care visits in Colombia
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB Background In low transmission settings early diagnosis is the main strategy to reduce adverse outcomes of malaria in pregnancy; however, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are inadequate for detecting low-density infections. We studied the performance of the highly sensitive-RDT (hsRDT) and the loop mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) for the detection ofP. falciparumin pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in two malaria-endemic municipalities in Colombia. We screened pregnant women in the context of an antenatal care program in health facilities and evaluated five tests (microscopy, conventional RDT, hsRDT, LAMP and nested polymerase chain reaction-PCR) for the detection ofP. falciparumin peripheral blood, using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance of hsRDT and LAMP were compared with routine testing. Results The prevalence ofP. falciparumwas 4.5% by qRT-PCR, half of those infections were subpatent. The sensitivity of the hsRDT (64.1%) was slightly better compared to microscopy and cRDT (59 and 53.8% respectively). LAMP had the highest sensitivity (89.7%) for detectingP. falciparumand the ability to detect very low-density infections (minimum parasite density detected 0.08 p/mu L). Conclusions There is an underestimation ofPlasmodiumspp. infections by tests routinely used in pregnant women attending antenatal care visits. LAMP methodology can be successfully implemented at local hospitals in malaria-endemic areas. The relevance of detecting and treating this sub-patentP. falciparuminfections in pregnant women should be evaluated.

TI Malaria infection prevalence and sensitivity of reactive case detection
   in Zanzibar
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background: Reactive case detection (RCD) is a commonly used strategy for malaria surveillance and response in elimination settings. Many approaches to RCD assume detectable infections are clustered within and around homes of passively detected cases (index households), which has been evaluated in a number of settings with disparate results.
   Methods: Household questionnaires and diagnostic testing were conducted following RCD investigations in Zanzibar, Tanzania, including the index household and up to 9 additional neighboring households.
   Results: Of 12,487 participants tested by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT), 3.2% of those residing in index households and 0.4% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 8.4; 95%CI: 5.7, 12.5). Of 6,281 participants tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 8.4% of those residing in index households and 1.3% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 7.1; 95%CI: 6.1, 10.9). Within households of index cases defined as imported, odds of qPCR-positivity amongst members reporting recent travel were 1.4 times higher than among those without travel history (95%CI: 0.2, 4.4). Amongst non-index households, odds of qPCR-detectable infection were no different between households located within 50 m of the index household as compared with those located farther away (OR = 0.8, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.4). Sensitivity of RDT to detect qPCR-detectable infections was 34% (95%CI: 26.4, 42.3).
   Conclusions: Malaria prevalence in index households in Zanzibar is much higher than in non-index households, in which prevalence is very low. Travelers represent a high-risk population. Low sensitivity of RDTs due to a high prevalence of low-density infections results in an RCD system missing a large proportion of the parasite reservoir. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum lacking histidine-rich proteins 2
   and 3: a systematic review
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Objective To calculate prevalence estimates and evaluate the quality of studies reporting Plasmodium falciparum lacking histidine-rich proteins 2 and 3, to inform an international response plan.
   Methods We searched five online databases, without language restriction, for articles reporting original data on Plasmodium falciparum-infected patients with deletions of the pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes (pfhrp2/3). We calculated prevalence estimates of pfhrp2/3 deletions and mapped the data by country. The denominator was all P. falciparum-positive samples testing positive by microscopy and confirmed positive by species-specific polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR). If microscopy was not performed, we used the number of samples based on a different diagnostic method or PCR alone. We scored studies for risk of bias and the quality of laboratory methods using a standardized scoring system.
   Findings A total of 38 articles reporting 55 studies from 32 countries and one territory worldwide were included in the review. We found considerable heterogeneity in the populations studied, methods used and estimated prevalence of P. falciparum parasites with pfhrp2/3 deletions. The derived prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions ranged from 0% to 100%, including focal areas in South America and Africa. Only three studies (5%) fulfilled all seven criteria for study quality.
   Conclusion The lack of representative surveys or consistency in study design impairs evaluations of the risk of false-negative results in malaria diagnosis due to pfhrp2/3 deletions. Accurate mapping and strengthened monitoring of the prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions is needed, along with harmonized methods that facilitate comparisons across studies.
